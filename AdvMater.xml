         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, three&#8208;dimensional hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here, we demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8764;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8764; 1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain. We explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compresses before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cell. Here, we perform synergistic passivation in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest PLQY of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#3934;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and PCE of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. Our work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, we report a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) was selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer were optimized through rising them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination were significantly improved. The optimal 0.04 and 1.00 cm2 single&#8208;junction OSCs based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibited a 19.56% power conversion efficiency, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Delicate Co&#8208;Control of Shell Structure and Sulfur Vacancies in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Tungsten Disulfide Hollow Sphere for Fast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is a promising multi&#8208;functional platform for energy storage, owing to its unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property and buffering function. Accurate co&#8208;control of its multiscale structures might bring fascinating properties and new opportunities, which is highly desired yet rarely achieved due to the challenging synthesis. Herein, a sequential sulfidation and etching approach is developed to achieve the delicate co&#8208;control over both molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;scale structure of WS2&#8208;x HoMS. Typically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8208;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is obtained from triple&#8208;shelled WO3 HoMS. By further coating with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, WS2&#8208;x HoMS maintains a reversible capacity of 241.7 mAh/g at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles for sodium storage, which is superior to the previously reported results. Mechanism analyses reveal that HoMS provides good electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and plentiful sodium storage sites as well as an effective buffer of the stress/strain during cycling; sulfur vacancy and expanded interlayer of WS2&#8208;x enhance ion diffusion kinetics; carbon coating improves the electron conductivity and benefits the structural stability. This finding offers prospects for realizing practical fast&#8208;charging, high&#8208;energy, and long&#8208;cycling sodium storage.

         <title>Accelerating Electron&#8208;Transfer Dynamics by TiO2&#8208;Immobilized Reversible Single&#8208;Atom Copper for Enhanced Artificial Photosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper is proposed for enhancing artificial urea photosynthesis using N2 and CO2 in pure H2O. The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the accelerated electron&#8208;transfer dynamics can be attributed to the reversibility of single&#8208;atom Cu for ensuring multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demand and supply of urea photosynthesis, thereby yielding as high as 432.12&#160;&#181;g gcat.&#8722;1 of urea.








Abstract
Photocatalysis as a sustainable technology is expected to provide a novel sight for the green synthesis of urea directly using N2, CO2, and H2O under mild conditions. However, the fundamental issue of inefficient electron transfer in photocatalysis strongly hinders its feasibility, especially for the above multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding urea synthesis. Herein, an effective strategy of accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics is reported by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper (denoted as Cu SA&#8208;TiO2) to enhance the performance for photosynthesis of urea from N2, CO2, and H2O. As revealed by a series of quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations (e.g., electron paramagnetic resonance, and wavelength&#8208;resolved and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies), the expedited dynamics behaviors originating from reversible single&#8208;atom copper in as&#8208;designed Cu SA&#8208;TiO2 (electron extraction rate: over 30 times faster than the reference photocatalysts) allow the assurance of abundant and continual photogenerated electrons for multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding co&#8208;photoactivation of N2 and CO2, resulting in considerable rates of urea production. The strategy above for improving the photoelectron&#8208;extraction ability of photocatalysts will offer a high&#8208;efficiency and promising route for artificial urea photosynthesis and other multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding photocatalytic reactions.

Herein, an effective strategy of accelerating electron-transfer dynamics is reported by TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-immobilized reversible single-atom copper (denoted as Cu SA-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to enhance the performance for photosynthesis of urea from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. As revealed by a series of quasi-in-situ characterizations (e.g., electron paramagnetic resonance, and wavelength-resolved and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopies), the expedited dynamics behaviors originating from reversible single-atom copper in as-designed Cu SA-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (electron extraction rate: over 30 times faster than the reference photocatalysts) allow the assurance of abundant and continual photogenerated electrons for multi-electron-demanding co-photoactivation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in considerable rates of urea production. The strategy above for improving the photoelectron-extraction ability of photocatalysts will offer a high-efficiency and promising route for artificial urea photosynthesis and other multi-electron-demanding photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room temperature gate&#8208;tunable non&#8208;reciprocal charge transport in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Symmetry manipulation can be used to effectively tailor the physical order in solid&#8208;state systems. With the breaking of both the inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, non&#8208;reciprocal magneto&#8208;transport may arise in nonmagnetic systems to enrich spin&#8208;orbit effects. This study investigated the observation of unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe films up to room temperature. Benefiting from the strong built&#8208;in electric field of 0.13 V&#8901;nm&#8722;1 in the heterojunction region, the resulting Rashba&#8208;type spin&#8208;orbit coupling and quantum confinement resulted in a distinct sinusoidal UMR signal with a non&#8208;reciprocal coefficient that was 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude larger than most non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials at 298 K. Moreover, this heterostructure configuration enabled highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, wherein the UMR amplitude was enhanced by 40%. The results of this study advocate the use of narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based hybrid systems with robust spin textures as suitable platforms for the pursuit of controllable chiral spin&#8208;orbit applications.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multi&#8208;purpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. We reconfigure the memFPAA and implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A Monolithic Graphene&#8208;Functionalized Microlaser for Multispecies Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of 2D materials and optical microcavities offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques. In this work, graphene&#8208;enabled splitting modes in a monolithic microsphere laser are used to obtain multispecies gas detection (CO2, NH3, NO2,&#160;and H2O) with extremely high sensitivity down to individual molecules.








Abstract
Optical&#8208;microcavity&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter interaction offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles, and large molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, a functionalized microlaser sensor is realized by depositing graphene in an erbium&#8208;doped over&#8208;modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co&#8208;generated in a single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2&#8211;1.1&#160;MHz) with sub&#8208;kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene&#8208;induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows for lab&#8208;free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive gas detection down to individual molecule.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Hijacking Nanoparticles Spatiotemporally Directing Endogenous Ferroptosis for Synergistic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which can induce ferroptosis through activation of endogenous iron. This strategy highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Existing ferroptosis as an iron&#8208;dependent form of regulated cell death primarily relies on importing exogenous iron. However, the excessive employment of toxic materials may cause potential adverse effects on human health. Herein, a ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated, by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) for endogenous ferroptosis without introducing Fenton&#8208;reactive metals. Once internalized, the designed Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15 NPs can specifically accumulate around ferritin. With laser irradiation, the activated Ce6 in nanoparticles potently generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrounding ferritin. Abundant ROS not only helps&#160;to destroy the iron storage protein and activate endogenous ferroptosis but also directly kill tumor cells. In turn, the released iron partially interacts with intracellular excess H2O2 to produce O2, thereby enhancing photodynamic therapy and further amplifying oxidative stress. Overall, this work highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.

         <title>Rapidly Photocurable Solid&#8208;State Poly(ionic liquid) Ionogels For Thermally Robust and Flexible Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization of rationally formulated poly(ionic liquid) ionogels enables rapid curing within a minute, forming highly transparent and stretchable electrolytes with excellent thermal, electrochemical, and air stability for high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices&#160;that are operable over wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). These ionogels are used to construct curved electrochromic eye protectors and flexible electrochromic displays, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.








Abstract
Formation of ionogels through in situ polymerization can effectively improve electrolyte processability; however, the curing process has been slow and oxygen&#8208;sensitive. Considering the low oxygen solubility of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs), in situ polymerized ionogels are designed to realize excellent electrolytes. Herein, two in situ polymerized ionogels (PIL A &amp; PIL B) are formulated, and they can be rapidly photocured within a minute. The ionogels are highly transparent, stretchable, and exhibit excellent physicochemical stability, including thermal, electrochemical, and air stability, allowing them to perform in various conditions. Benefitting from these properties, two high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices (ECDs) are assembled, with iron&#8208;centered coordination polymer (FeCP) and tungsten oxide (P&#8208;WO3) electrochromic materials, achieving high color contrast (45.2% and 56.4%), fast response time (1.5/1.9 and 1.7/6.4 s), and excellent cycling endurance (&gt;90% retention over 3000 cycles). Attributed to the thermal robustness of the ionogels, the ECDs can also be operated over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). With the use of deformable substrates (e.g., ultrathin ITO glass), curved electrochromic eye protector and flexible electrochromic displays are realized, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.

Benefitting from these properties, two high-performance electrochromic devices (ECDs) are assembled, with iron-centered coordination polymer (FeCP) and tungsten oxide (P-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) electrochromic materials, achieving high color contrast (45.2% and 56.4%), fast response time (1.5/1.9 and 1.7/6.4 s), and excellent cycling endurance (&amp;gt;90% retention over 3000 cycles). Attributed to the thermal robustness of the ionogels, the ECDs can also be operated over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). With the use of deformable substrates (e.g., ultrathin ITO glass), curved electrochromic eye protector and flexible electrochromic displays are realized, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>A Manganese&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme of manganese&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and developed by mimicking the structural features of the natural counterparts. It exhibits extremely stable oxidase&#8208;like activity at both psychrophilic and mesophilic condition (0&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, a low&#8208;temperature antivirus strategy is innovatively established based on nMnBTC to inactive influenza virus H1N1 with high efficiency at &#8722;20 &#176;C.








Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on a manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and synthesized. The nMnBTC as an oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#160;&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#160;&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high&#8208;catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity, and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>A Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskite Based Self&#8208;Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance and self&#8208;powered blue perovskite photodetector (PPD) is developed by designing and optimizing A&#8208;site of APb(Br0.65Cl0.35)3 (A = formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), Cs+) perovskites (PVSKs). The incorporation of Cs+ into FA/MA&#8208;PVSKs reduces the lattice strain and defect density. Consequently, a best&#8208;performing Cs&#8208;incorporating device shows an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9% which is the highest EQE reported in blue PDs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, color&#8208;filter&#8208;free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites is reported. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A&#8208;site monovalent cations of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs+ ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increases charge&#8208;carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215; 1012 Jones under blue light. Furthermore, Cs+ improves durability under repetitive operations and ambient atmosphere. The proposed device exhibits peak responsivity of 0.307&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, which is higher than that of the commercial InGaN&#8208;based blue PD (0.289&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1). This study will promote the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors with vertically stacked perovskite PDs.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Polarization Manipulation of Ferroelectricity in Twisted hBN</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectricity is generated in twisted hBN flakes, which are used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction. Spatially resolved investigation by a conductive atomic force microscope tip reveals the unconventional ferroelectricity in this system, including lattice&#8208;slide&#8208;induced domain change, an unusual relationship between the tunneling resistance and polarization, and highly spatially dependent ferroelectric hysteresis.








Abstract
Robust room&#8208;temperature interfacial ferroelectricity has been formed in the 2D&#160;limit by simply twisting two atomic layers of non&#8208;ferroelectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). A thorough understanding of this newly discovered ferroelectric system is required. Here, twisted hBN is used as a tunneling junction and it is studied at the nanometer scale using conductive atomic force microscopy. Three properties unique to this system are discovered. First, the polarization dependence of the tunneling resistance contrasts with the conventional theory. Second, the ferroelectric domains can be controlled using mechanical stress, highlighting the original meaning of the emergent &#8220;slidetronics&#8221;. Third, ferroelectric hysteresis is highly spatially dependent. The hysteresis is symmetric at the domain walls. A few nanometers away, the hysteresis shifts completely to the positive or negative side, depending on the original polarization. These findings reveal the unconventional ferroelectricity in this 2D system.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Accelerated Development of Efficient Mixed Protonic&#8211;Electronic Conducting Oxides as the Air Electrodes for Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are constructed to predict the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of the 3200 newly mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Subsequently, the screened oxide (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 with the highest HPC is synthesized, and it is applied as an air electrode for the protonic ceramic cells operating in both electrolysis and fuel cell modes at intermediate temperatures.








Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning models are constructed to predict the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of the 3200 newly mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Subsequently, the screened oxide (La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;)(Co&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the highest HPC is synthesized, and it is applied as an air electrode for the protonic ceramic cells operating in both electrolysis and fuel cell modes at intermediate temperatures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the development of high-performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial-and-error process, which is extremely time consuming and high cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from the published literature, the machine-learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs.

         <title>Dynamic Assembly of Viscoelastic Networks by Aqueous Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8211;Solid Phase Separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks is achieved for the first time by aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2). The networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated droplets as templates, followed by liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the continuous phase.








Abstract
Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal networks, which can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, a new aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) is proposed, which consists of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to regulate the self&#8208;assembly of condensates on&#8208;demand. Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated DEX droplets as templates and the following liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the PNIPAM&#8208;rich phase. The resulting networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 min. This work demonstrates rich phase&#8208;separation behaviors in a single ATPS through incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers. The concept can potentially be applied to other macromolecules through other stimuli to develop materials with rich phase behaviors and hierarchical structures.

Charged interfaces are a central functional domain for advanced energy materials and biomacromolecules. Predictive simulations play a pivotal role in understanding molecular mechanisms, optimizing performance metrics, and providing rational design strategies for novel advanced materials.








Abstract
Electrostatic interactions play a dominant role in charged materials systems. Understanding the complex correlation between macroscopic properties with microscopic structures is of critical importance to develop rational design strategies for advanced materials. But the complexity of this challenging task is augmented by interfaces present in the charged materials systems, such as electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces or biological membranes. Over the last decades, predictive molecular simulations that are founded in fundamental physics and optimized for charged interfacial systems have proven their value in providing molecular understanding of physicochemical properties and functional mechanisms for diverse materials. Novel design strategies utilizing predictive models have been suggested as promising route for the rational design of materials with tailored properties. Here, an overview of recent advances in the understanding of charged interfacial systems aided by predictive molecular simulations is presented. Focusing on three types of charged interfaces found in energy materials and biomacromolecules, how the molecular models characterize ion structure, charge transport, morphology relation to the environment, and the thermodynamics/kinetics of molecular binding at the interfaces is discussed. The critical analysis brings two prominent field of energy materials and biological science under common perspective, to stimulate crossover in both research field that have been largely&#160;separated.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#63743;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#63743;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

Tetradentate gold(III) thermally activated delayed fluorescent complexes, showing&#160;green emission with near&#8208;unity &#934; and kr approaching 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films,&#160;are reported. The vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them demonstrate maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 27% with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs and LT90 device lifetimes of up to 1820 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
High maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and long operational lifetime at practical luminances are three crucial parameters for commercialization of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To simultaneously achieve these goals, it is desirable to have the radiative decay rate constant (kr) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S1&#8594;S0 radiative decay rate constant (krS) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Here, the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;EST while keeping the krS large is reported. The as&#8208;synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields, and kr approaching 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films. The vacuum&#8208;deposited green OLEDs based on 1 and 4 demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll&#8208;offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (19% (1) and 24% (4)). A long LT90 device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for complex 1 is achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF&#8208;OLEDs reported in the literature.

&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; radiative decay rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;). Here, the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; while keeping the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; large is reported. The as-synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields, and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; approaching 2&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in thin films. The vacuum-deposited green OLEDs based on &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll-offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (19% (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and 24% (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;)). A long LT&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF-OLEDs reported in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metabolic Homeostasis&#8208;Regulated Nanoparticles for Antibody&#8208;Independent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment aggravated by X&#8208;ray irradiation, a liposome loaded with mannose and levamisole (M/LM&#8208;Lipo) is developed for cellular metabolism regulation and macrophage polarization. The M/LM&#8208;Lipo orchestrates radio&#8208;immunotherapy by the simultaneous modulation of glucose and mitochondrial metabolic pathways in both cancer cells and macrophages, achieving systematic antitumor immune response for effective tumor ablation and metastasis elimination.








Abstract
The special metabolic traits of cancer cells and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are promising targets for developing novel cancer therapy strategies, especially the glycolysis and mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, therapies targeting a singular metabolic pathway are always counteracted by the metabolic reprogramming of cancer, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, this work employs poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) liposomes as the drug delivery system for both mannose and levamisole hydrochloride to simultaneously inhibit glycolysis and restrain mitochondrial energy metabolism and thus inhibit tumor growth. In combination with radiotherapy, the liposomes can not only modulate the immunosuppressive TME by cellular metabolism regulation to achieve potent therapeutic effect for local tumors, but also suppress the M2 macrophage proliferation triggered by X&#8208;ray irradiation and thus enhance the immune response to inhibit metastatic lesions. In brief, this work provides a new therapeutic strategy targeting the special metabolic traits of cancer cells and immunosuppressive TAMs to enhance the abscopal effect of radiotherapy for cancer.

         <title>Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron with Excitatory&#8211;Inhibitory Spatiotemporal Dynamics Applied for Neuronal Oscillations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;transistor neuron with excitatory&#8211;inhibitory spatiotemporal dynamics is constructed by integrating a threshold switch with a 2D MoS2&#160;channel, which exhibits bio&#8208;realistic dynamics to achieve essential neuronal functions such as leaky integration, threshold&#8208;driven fire, inhibition, and self&#8208;recovery. The device can be adopted to emulate high&#8208;dimensional population code&#8212;neuronal oscillations and support information integration and synchronization.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing systems with the potential to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence demand a spectrum of critical components beyond simple characteristics. An emerging research trend is to achieve advanced functions with ultracompact neuromorphic devices. In this work, a single&#8208;transistor neuron is demonstrated that implements excitatory&#8211;inhibitory (E&#8211;I) spatiotemporal integration and a series of essential neuron behaviors. Neuronal oscillations, the fundamental mode of neuronal communication, that construct high&#8208;dimensional population code to achieve efficient computing in the brain, can also be demonstrated by the neuron transistors. The highly scalable E&#8211;I neuron can be the basic building block for implementing core neuronal circuit motifs and large&#8208;scale architectural plans to replicate energy&#8208;efficient neural computations, forming the foundation of future integrated neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, we developed a novel and efficient Ir&#8208;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#8208;N5 SA) nanozyme with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#8208;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#8208;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can generate a large amount of ROS through OXD&#8208;like and POD&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can also generate O2 and H2O2 through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, our designed Ir&#8208;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupts redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascades reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining the desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, we present a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S, Se)3 solar cell films. We adopted a top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S, Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film in this study to consolidate our investigation. Our study reveals that the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S, Se)3 film under hydrothermal conditions generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: (1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by (2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8208;anion anti&#8208;site defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films, and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Alloy Aerogels: A New Platform for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high&#8208;entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate a series of HEAAs via freeze&#8208;thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs could achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from &#8208;0.7 to &#8208;1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a maximum FEHCOOH of 98.1% at &#8208;1.1 VRHE, outperforming the PdCuAuAgBiIn high&#8208;entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FEHCOOH are almost 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO2RR performance of PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between different metals and surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high-entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate a series of HEAAs via freeze-thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs could achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from -0.7 to -1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a maximum FE&lt;sub&gt;HCOOH&lt;/sub&gt; of 98.1% at -1.1 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;, outperforming the PdCuAuAgBiIn high-entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FE&lt;sub&gt;HCOOH&lt;/sub&gt; are almost 200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between different metals and surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, we present a high&#8208;performance flexible PD by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8764;106, a fast response time of 67 &#956;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7 &#215; 1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804; 0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Surface hydrophobization provides hygroscopic supramolecular plastics based on polysaccharides with damage&#8208;Specific healability and room&#8208;Temperature recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supramolecular materials with room&#8208;temperature healability and recyclability are highly desired because they could extend materials lifetimes and reduce resources consumption. Most approaches towards healing and recycling rely on the dynamically reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen, ionic and coordinate bonds, which are hygroscopic and vulnerable to water. The general water&#8208;induced plasticization facilitates the healing and reprocessing process but cause a troubling problem of random self&#8208;adhesion. To address this issue, here we report that by modifying the hygroscopic surfaces with hydrophobic alkyl chains of dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS), supramolecular plastic films based on commercial raw materials of sodium alginate (SA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) display extraordinary damage&#8208;specific healability. Owing to the hydrophobic surfaces, the random self&#8208;adhesion is eliminated even under humid environment. When damage occurs, the fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose exclusively at the damaged site. Thus, damage&#8208;specific healing can be readily facilitated by the water&#8208;induced plasticization. Moreover, the films display excellent room&#8208;temperature recyclability. After multiple times of reprocessing and re&#8208;modifying with DTMS, the rejuvenated films exhibit fatigueless mechanical properties. We anticipate this approach to damage&#8208;specific healing and room&#8208;temperature recycling based on surface hydrophobization can be applied to design various of supramolecular plastic polysaccharides materials for building sustainable societies.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, we introduce an automated platform for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. Our platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, we have discovered 8 potential candidates for organic lasers. We test the lasing threshold of 4 molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find 2 molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

         <title>Discovery of Type II interlayer trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdW HS) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdW HS, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions and poor interface quality, etc. Here we report the first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8208;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L + 2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. Our results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8208;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here we employ nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. Our findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

         <title>Improving OFF&#8208;State Bias&#8208;Stress Stability in High&#8208;Mobility Conjugated Polymer Transistors with an Anti&#8208;Solvent Treatment</title>

Abstract
Conjugated polymer field&#8208;effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge carrier mobilities and compatibility with large&#8208;area, low&#8208;temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON&#8208;state (accumulation mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF&#8208;state (depletion mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF&#8208;state for most of the time. Here, we present a simple method of using an anti&#8208;solvent treatment to achieve significant improvements in OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution&#8208;processable indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDT&#8208;BT). IDT&#8208;BT is weakly crystalline, and we attribute the notable improvements to an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps. Our work highlights the importance of the microstructure in weakly crystalline polymer films and offers a simple processing strategy for achieving the reliability required for applications in flexible electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymer field-effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge carrier mobilities and compatibility with large-area, low-temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON-state (accumulation mode) bias-stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF-state (depletion mode) bias-stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF-state for most of the time. Here, we present a simple method of using an anti-solvent treatment to achieve significant improvements in OFF-state bias-stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution-processable indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole (IDT-BT). IDT-BT is weakly crystalline, and we attribute the notable improvements to an anti-solvent-induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced agglomeration of single&#8208;atom platinum in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here we describe the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. DFT calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reducing the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, we show that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness were manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of three&#8208;dimensionally printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, we study the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>Hygroscopic&#8208;Microgels&#8208;Enabled Rapid Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hygroscopic microgels (HMGs), composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and salt, are developed for extracting moisture from arid air. The HMGs can realize rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics by short&#8208;distance diffusion in microgels and thermoresponsiveness of HPC, exhibiting 24&#8211;36 cycles of operation per day at low RH with potential water yield of 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) has emerged as a promising decentralized water&#8208;production technology to mitigate the freshwater crisis in arid areas. Hydrogels have been regarded as attractive sorbents due to their high water retention and tailorable polymer&#8211;water interactions. Yet, the kinetics of water sorption and desorption at low relative humidity (RH) shall be improved for their practical implementation. Here, hygroscopic microgels (HMGs) composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hygroscopic salt are reported, which achieve a water uptake of ca. 0.5&#8211;0.8&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% RH. HMGs enable rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics owing to the short&#8208;distance diffusion in the microgels and hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity switching of the thermoresponsive HPC. To validate the feasibility of HMGs for moisture extraction, a potential daily water collection of up to equivalent 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1 at low RH is demonstrated, enabled by 24&#8211;36 operation cycles per day based on the material&#8208;level experiments. With renewable raw materials and superior performance, HMGs provide a sustainable approach for rapid moisture extraction in arid climates.

         <title>Rationally Reconstructed Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks as Robust Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based materials have become one of the most important types of electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a novel design strategy for the MOF structure is highly needed to overcome the current development bottleneck of the electrochemical performance. Reconstructing MOFs towards a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented OER electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet due to the significant challenges during the synthesis. Here, we report the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure, viz., from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the Fe sites in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with uncoordinated phenolic hydroxyls are more electroactive than that in MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe. Benefiting from this desired electronic structure, the designed MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH catalyst exhibits high intrinsic OER activity, including a low overpotential of 215&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 45.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.44 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, over 80 times that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (0.0177 s&#8722;1). The radically reduced eg&#8208;t2g crystal field splitting in Fe&#8208;3d and thus the much suppressed electron hopping barriers through the synergistic effects of the O species from the coordinated carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated phenolic groups guarantee the efficient OER in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH. Consistent with the DFT calculations, the real&#8208;time kinetic simulation reveals that the conversion from O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step on the active sites of MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH. This work establishes a MOF platform to systematically investigate the structure&#8208;property relationship for rationally designing and fabricating robust OER electrocatalysts in the future.

         <title>Ultrafast Spectroscopy of Plasmons and Free Carriers in 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes have diverse and chemically tunable optical properties that arise from an interplay between free carriers, interband transitions and plasmon resonances. The nature of photoexcitations and their dynamics in three different members of MXene family, Ti3C2, Mo2Ti2C3, and Nb2C, were investigated using two complementary pump&#8208;probe techniques, transient optical absorption and time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Measurements reveal pronounced plasmonic effects in the visible and near&#8208;IR in all three MXenes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes have diverse and chemically tunable optical properties that arise from an interplay between free carriers, interband transitions and plasmon resonances. The nature of photoexcitations and their dynamics in three different members of MXene family, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, were investigated using two complementary pump-probe techniques, transient optical absorption and time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Measurements reveal pronounced plasmonic effects in the visible and near-IR in all three MXenes. Optical excitation, with either 400&#160;nm or 800&#160;nm pulses, results in rapid increase in lattice temperature, evidenced by a pronounced broadening of the plasmon mode which presents as a plasmon bleach in transient absorption measurements. Observed kinetics of plasmon bleach recovery provide a means to monitor lattice cooling.

         <title>Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, we present two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5 G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. Our work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Development of closed&#8208;loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in our daily life could be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy&#8208;to&#8208;recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, we report a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs), which not only display mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate (PC), but also exhibit excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra&#8208;CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogues that don't have noncovalent crosslinks show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra&#8208;CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer&#8208;monomer&#8208;polymer circulation. This work provides new design principles for high&#8208;performance chemically recyclable CANs as sustainable substitutes for the conventional plastics.

         <title>Bionic engineered protein coating boosting anti&#8208;biofouling in complex biological fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, we have developed a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsions of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Retinomorphic Device for Spontaneous Chromatic Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retinomorphic vision sensor based on bilayer platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is proposed. The sensor mimics the chromatic adaptation of the human retina. The photocontrolled adsorption and desorption of O2 molecules on the PtSe2 surface lead to wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoconductivity. Spontaneous chromatic adaptation based on this device provides a basis for developing artificial vision perception systems with simplified circuitry.








Abstract
Chromatic adaptation refers to the sensing and preprocessing of the spectral composition of incident light on the retina, and it is important for color&#8208;image recognition. It is challenging to apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images via the same physical process using the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology because of redundant data detection, complicated signal conversion processes, and the requirement for additional memory modules. Inspired by the highly efficient chromatic adaptation of the human retina, a 2D oxygen&#8208;mediated platinum diselenide (PtSe2) device is presented to simultaneously apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images. The device exhibits a wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoresponse and the linear pulse&#8208;number dependence of photoconductivity, which is dominated by the photon&#8208;mediated physical adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules on bilayer PtSe2. The proposed retinomorphic device shows superior image classification accuracy (over 90%) compared to an independent pseudocolor channel (less than 75%). Hence, it is promising for developing artificial vision perception systems with reduced architectural complexity.

         <title>A Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme&#160;for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of defect engineering, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme is developed for combinational second near&#8208;infrared photothermal immunotherapy of cancer. This controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. Herein, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) is reported for combinational second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

CMO-R@4T1 consists of a Cu-doped MoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor-cell-derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO-R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR-II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long-term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell-membrane-camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo-immunotherapy of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Ion Current Saturation Regimes Enabled via Heterostructured Nanofluidic Devices Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidic devices displaying switchable ion current saturation regimes can be realized by integration of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into asymmetric nanochannels. These unusual transport properties stem from the interplay between the permselectivity and heterostructure of the MOF&#8208;modified nanochannels. These devices can operate over a wide range of saline concentrations and their properties can be reversibly modulated by changing the pH.








Abstract
The use of track&#8208;etched membranes allows further fine&#8208;tuning of transport regimes and thus enables their use in (bio)sensing and energy&#8208;harvesting applications, among others. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been combined with such membranes to further increase their potential. Herein, the creation of a single track&#8208;etched nanochannel modified with the UiO&#8208;66 MOF is proposed. By the interfacial growth method, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined synthesis fills the nanochannel completely and smoothly, yet its constructional porosity renders a heterostructure along the axial coordinate of the channel. The MOF heterostructure confers notorious changes in the transport regime of the nanofluidic device. In particular, the tortuosity provided by the micro&#8208; and mesostructure of UiO&#8208;66 added to its charged state leads to iontronic outputs characterized by an asymmetric ion current saturation for transmembrane voltages exceeding 0.3&#160;V. Remarkably, this behavior can be easily and reversibly modulated by changing the pH of the media and it can also be maintained for a wide range of KCl concentrations. In addition, it is found that the modified&#8208;nanochannel functionality cannot be explained by considering just the intrinsic microporosity of UiO&#8208;66, but rather the constructional porosity that arises during the MOF growth process plays a central and dominant role.

         <title>Interface Reconstruction from Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Structures Impacts Stability in Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky cations are widely used in the halide perovskite field to reduce nonradiative recombination at interfaces. In this work, a critical perspective on the use of these organohalide salts is provided. It is demonstrated that some of these capping layers are unstable and prolonged annealing is proposed&#160;as a critical way to drive the selection between different bulky cations for improved stability.








Abstract
The impact of the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;modified interfaces on halide perovskite solar cell stability is underexplored. In this work, the thermal instability of the bulky&#8208;cation interface layers used in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells is demonstrated. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal significant changes in the chemical composition and structure at the surface of these films that occur under thermal stress. The changes impact charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and device operation, as shown in transient photoluminescence, excitation correlation spectroscopy, and solar cells. The type of cation used for surface treatment affects the extent of these changes, where long carbon chains provide more stable interfaces. These results highlight that prolonged annealing of the treated interfaces is critical to enable reliable reporting of performances and to drive the selection of different bulky cations.

         <title>Local Electric Field&#8208;Promoted Kinetics and Interfacial Stability of Phosphorus Anode with Ionic Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phosphorus anode is a promising option for energy storage applications because of its high theoretical specific capacity and safe lithiation potential. However, the multiphase phosphorus lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation reactions and soluble reaction intermediates cause sluggish reaction kinetics and active materials loss. Herein, a novel local electric field (LEF) strategy is proposed to inhibit the intermediates dissolution and promote the reaction kinetics by optimizing ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs). Among them, the LEF induced by the cationic covalent organic framework effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of phosphorus anode. The strong electrostatic interaction between the polyphosphides and cationic covalent organic framework confines the dissolution of active materials and tailors the electronic structure of polyphosphides to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The cationic covalent organic framework&#8208;assisted phosphorus anode provides a high capacity of 1227.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.4 A g&#8722;1 (8.6 C) and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 87% after 500 cycles at 1.3 A g&#8722;1. This contribution not only broadens the application of iCOFs for phosphorus anode but also inspires the great potential of local electric field in battery technology.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence.[6] Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, we demonstrate a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide based ferroelectric encoder for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enables a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, a feedforward SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information from our ferroelectric encoder, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved using the MNIST dataset for digits classification. Moreover, our ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfides conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, the single atom vanadium anchored on three&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8208;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8208;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445 mAh g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke (MNC) as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical crosslinking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h &#8208;1 under one sun illumination is delivered, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h &#8208;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8208;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. Firstly, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Secondly, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

         <title>Self&#8208;sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, we report harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and under water. The three&#8208;dimensional, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. We find that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, we show that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

Abstract
Driven by the intensive efforts in the development of high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectrics for mass&#8208;market application in power generation and refrigeration, GeTe&#8208;based materials display a high figure of merit of &gt; 2.0 and an energy conversion efficiency beyond 10%. However, there still needs a comprehensive review on GeTe, from fundamentals to devices. In this regard, we timely review the latest progress on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeTe. We fundamentally analyze the phase transition, intrinsic high carrier concentration, and multiple band edges of GeTe from the perspectives of the native atomic orbital, chemical bonding, and lattice defects. Then, the fabrication methods are summarized with a focus on large&#8208;scale production. Afterward, we comprehensively review the strategies for enhancing electronic transports of GeTe by energy filtering effect, resonance doping, band convergence, and Rashba band splitting, and the methods for strengthening phonon scatterings via nanoprecipitates, planar vacancies, and superlattices. Besides, the device assembly and performance are highlighted. In the end, we conclude and propose future research directions, which will enlighten the development of broader thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;To&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An input&#8208;to&#8208;output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.








Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au are applied as photonic logic gates that show continuously variable emission colors from 475 to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures are controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences among different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Inverse Domain Scaling in Polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline ErMnO3 displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO3 and their interaction with elastic strain fields.








Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti&#8208;vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far&#8208;reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology&#8208;based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.

&lt;p&gt;The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti-vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric-field-controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti-vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far-reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology-based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Etching Bulk Covalent Organic Frameworks into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new preparation strategy for nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is reported, and this strategy only needs to slightly extend the commonly used COF preparation process to prepare COF nanoparticles, which is suitable for different types of imine COFs. The nanoscale COF sonosensitizer is applied for enhanced sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. A covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer is developed by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy uses molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch the bulk COF into nanoparticles and has universal applicability to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure can prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endows the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy performance and glutathione consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieves a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;Like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive HCIr nanocluster is reported for triggering effective ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death via triggering GPX4 inhibition and concurrent dual sonodynamic effect by iridium oxide nanoclusters and chlorin e6 (Ce6). These HCIr nanoclusters hold a great promise as a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent for treating intrinsic apoptotic resistance of tumors, and the findings provide a promising strategy for future studies exploring nanoclusters as anticancer agents.








Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations have reported&#160;that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy can overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8211;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters, is developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibits highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound&#160;stimulation, which promotes the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induces ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr can deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8211;Ir (III) transition, which further suppresses the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that HCIr possesses tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhances SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. Thus, an iridium&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent is developed, providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

         <title>Immune Profiling and Multiplexed Label&#8208;Free Detection of 2D MXenes by Mass Cytometry and High&#8208;Dimensional Imaging</title>

&#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) is a multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy enabling nanomaterial tracking and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. MXenes are designed to be detected within the mass cytometry range. Their detection and quantification are demonstrated in 15 human immune cell subpopulations and in different organs.








Abstract
There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D&#160;materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy is proposed based on single&#8208;cell mass cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) and ion&#8208;beam imaging by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MIBI&#8208;TOF). This strategy, &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes&#8217; mediation of cell&#8211;cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI&#8208;TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label&#8208;free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single&#8208;cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro&#8208;Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) TFT performance can be substantially enhanced by placing aluminum micro&#8208;island arrays (Al&#8208;MIAs) directly on top of the IGZO back channel. The MIA channel coverages/dimensions can be readily optimized by vapor depositing Al through tailored honeycomb cinnamate&#8208;cellulose film shadow masks, demonstrating the great versatility of this route to enhance metal oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor performance.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here, a new strategy is reported to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#181;e) increases from &#8776;3.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 to near 15.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25 &#181;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and technology computer&#8208;aided design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#181;e of &gt;50.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 . This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicrometer resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long&#8208;sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D-Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D-Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D-Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol-rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D-aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one-pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D-aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D-Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol-rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D-aGe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reliable spintronic physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are demonstrated by exploiting field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. The stochastic switching polarity of the top CoFeB is achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.








Abstract
Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;Engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue&#8208;engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell&#8208;laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer&#8208;scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photo&#8208;crosslinkable biomaterials.

         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient In(Zn)As&#8211;In(Zn)P&#8211;GaP&#8211;ZnS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) that operate with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.3% at 1006 nm are reported. The implementation of a thin hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer at the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device gives rise to improved charge balance and luminescence efficiencies.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health&#8208;monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Short-wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye-safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health-monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy-metal-free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole-transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron-injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single-carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron-injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy-metal-free solution-processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are combined with probiotic extracts to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles, which are used to construct a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) to meet different conditions. The DMAH can treat bacterial wounds through phage&#8208;like therapy in the dark. Meanwhile, DMAH can perform rapid disinfection through the synergistic photothermal/NO therapy under near&#8208;infrared light to cure infected wounds.








Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through nonantibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) is combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tailspike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiates the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results reveal that the DMAH achieves a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected to 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation release NO, which, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damages bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multifunctional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoro segment (&#63743;CF2&#63743; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer&#8208;shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small&#8208;molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial.








Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small&#8208;molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self-assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small-molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug-loading efficiency of the biomaterial.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small-molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self-assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug-loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Photosensitizer to Reverse Hypoxia and Oxidative&#160;Resistance for Tumor Photodynamic Eradication</title>

An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

         <title>Polarization Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization domains in uniaxial ferroelectrics acquire a remarkable topological configuration of branching and crisscrossing domains. The domains are separated by the united domain wall spreading all over the sample and containing saddle&#8208;like singular nodes.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarization discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent 2D conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons, or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hallmark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarization meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;Salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Understanding H2 Evolution Electrochemistry to Minimize Solvated Water Impact on Zinc&#8208;Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, and it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode.








Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn&#8208;metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and, using a glycine additive to reduce solvated water, it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. This electrolyte additive is evidenced to suppress H2 evolution, reduce corrosion, and give a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells. It is demonstrated that Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8211;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte. It is concluded that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIBs for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Multiphase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency, Thick&#8208;Film, and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

Biofabrication
In article number 2204301, Marcy Zenobi&#8208;Wong and co&#8208;workers use Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication to create hydrogel constructs containing ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio microfilaments. FLight biofabrication is both fast and biocompatible. Microfilaments and associated microchannels provide effective topological guidance cues to instruct cell migration, alignment, and extracellular matrix deposition of resident cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biofabrication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202204301"&gt;2204301&lt;/a&gt;, Marcy Zenobi-Wong and co-workers use Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication to create hydrogel constructs containing ultrahigh-aspect-ratio microfilaments. FLight biofabrication is both fast and biocompatible. Microfilaments and associated microchannels provide effective topological guidance cues to instruct cell migration, alignment, and extracellular matrix deposition of resident cells.

Nanomedicine
The &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) strategy enables MXene detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features by single&#8208;cell mass cytometry and high&#8208;dimensional imaging. As demonstrated in article number 2205154, Yury Gogotsi, Lucia Gemma Delogu, and co&#8208;workers, LINKED allows a deep immune profiling of MXenes and can be extended to other 2D materials, enabling exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
In article number 2205284, Xue&#8208;Qiang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that by weakening the solvating power of the solvents, lithium polysulfides can be encapsulated to inhibit the parasitic reactions on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8211;CF2&#8211;segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power, similar to a submarine, to tightly encapsulate lithium polysulfides and achieve long&#8208;cycling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Magnetic Ordering
In article number 2206161, Jason D. Azoulay and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide robust spin&#8208;centers, intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange interactions, and anisotropic spin ordering. This new approach toward practically applicable metal&#8208;free magnetism opens new opportunities for emerging technologies that integrate spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects and operate at room temperature.

Photonic Logic Gates
In article number 2204839, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers describe a photonic logic gate device based on supramolecular heterostructures made by phosphorescent Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd complexes. The photonic logic gate operation is realized by an optical waveguiding effect and energy transfer among the different building blocks. These photonic logic gates have high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors ranging from blue to near&#8208;infrared spectral regions.

Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Here, it is described how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides are highlighted and future development trends in photocatalysis are envisioned.

         <title>Organic Neuroelectronics: From Neural Interfaces to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with a Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing robust and multifunctional kirigami electronics for wearable applications imposes strict restrictions on the constituent materials. In this work, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto the CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of physiological parameters.








Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on the 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations are conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of the&#160;CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provide essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto a CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin&#8208;temperature measurements, and measurement of other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices can shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>A Perovskite Photodetector Crossbar Array by Vapor Deposition for Dynamic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by vapor deposition method is presented, which shows a large rectification ratio and suppresses electrical crosstalk in the imaging array. Its fast response time allows smooth&#160;real&#8208;time image acquisition. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range and is sensitive to weak light.








Abstract
With the development of perovskite photodetectors, integrating photodetectors into array image sensors is the next target to pursue. The major obstacle to integrating perovskite photodiodes for dynamic imaging is the optoelectrical crosstalk among the pixels. Herein, a perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode (PIN&#8208;BD) crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by the vapor deposition method is presented. The PIN&#8208;BD shows a large rectification ratio of 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;102 under illumination, suppressing electrical crosstalk to as small as 8.0% in the imaging array. The fast response time of 72.8&#160;ns allows real&#8208;time image acquisition by over 25 frames per second. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range of 112&#160;dB with 4096 gray levels and weak light sensitivity under 1.2&#160;lux.

         <title>ECRAM Materials, Devices, Circuits and Architectures: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike two&#8208;terminal memristors, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) tunes conductance through ion injection into the channel through a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the challenging fundamental questions, and how ECRAM could be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low power neuromorphic computing are reviewed.








Abstract
Non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on two&#8208;terminal resistive nonvolatile memory elements has emerged as a promising approach, but its full potential has not been realized due to the lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Unlike memristors, which require large write currents to drive phase transformations or filament growth, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) decouples the &#8220;write&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; operations using a &#8220;gate&#8221; electrode to tune the conductance state through charge&#8208;transfer reactions, and every electron transferred through the external circuit in ECRAM corresponds to the migration of &#8776;1 ion used to store analogue information. Like static dopants in traditional semiconductors, electrochemically inserted ions modulate the conductivity by locally perturbing a host's electronic structure; however, ECRAM does so in a dynamic and reversible manner. The resulting change in conductance can span orders of magnitude, from gradual increments needed for analog elements, to large, abrupt changes for dynamically reconfigurable adaptive architectures. In this in&#8208;depth perspective, the history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the rich portfolio of challenging, fundamental questions, and how ECRAM can be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing are discussed.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid&#8208;Onset Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches composed of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives demonstrate strong and tough mechanical properties by virtue of multiple supramolecular interactions, surpassing that of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMN patches. CD DMN can load hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and dissolve extremely fast to achieve a rapid onset of its payloads, which is unachievable with conventional polymeric DMN patches.








Abstract
Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water&#8208;soluble, and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers are employed in DMNs because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow the DMNs with necessary mechanical strength and toughness.

     alt="Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid-Onset Capabilities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches composed of highly water-soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives demonstrate strong and tough mechanical properties by virtue of multiple supramolecular interactions, surpassing that of most state-of-the-art polymeric DMN patches. CD DMN can load hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and dissolve extremely fast to achieve a rapid onset of its payloads, which is unachievable with conventional polymeric DMN patches.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water-soluble, and high-molecular-weight polymers are employed in DMNs because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow the DMNs with necessary mechanical strength and toughness. However, high viscosity and heavy chain entanglement of polymer solutions greatly hinder processing and dissolution of polymeric DMNs. Here, a strong and tough supramolecular DMN patch made of highly water-soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives is described. Due to the synergy of multiple supramolecular interactions, the CD DMN patch exhibits robust mechanical strength outperforming the state-of-the-art polymeric DMNs. The CD DMN displays ultrafast dissolution (&amp;lt;30 s) in skin models by virtue of the dynamic and weak noncovalent bonds, which also enables the CD DMN and its payloads to diffuse rapidly into the deep skin layer. Moreover, the unique supramolecular structure of CD allows the CD DMNs to load not only hydrophilic drugs (e.g., rhodamine B as a model) but also hydrophobic model drugs (e.g., ibuprofen). As a proof-of-concept, CD DMNs loading ibuprofen show a rapid onset of therapeutic action in a xylene-induced acute inflammation model in mice. This work opens a new avenue for the development of mechanically robust supramolecular DMNs and broadens the applications of supramolecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via a Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Hydrazine Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine battery is proposed for separate and efficient hydrogen generation by temporally decoupled hydrazine splitting. The battery, realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst, decouples the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;)\[(1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4} + 2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^ - } \to 1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2} + 2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}} + 2{e^ - })\], which achieves separate hydrogen generation, ansimultaneously efficient hydrogen production with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96%.








Abstract
Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large&#8208;scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine (Zn&#8211;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;$1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4}{\bm{ + }}2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^{\bm{ - }}}{\bm{ \to }}1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{\bm{ + }}2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}}{\bm{ + }}2{e^{\bm{ - }}}$). This Zn&#8211;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on the cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of 3D Mo2C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8211;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with a low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and high energy efficiency of 96%. Remarkably, this battery exhibits outstanding long&#8208;term stability for 600 cycles (200&#160;h), achieving continuous hydrogen production on demand, which presents great potential for practical application.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals For Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>

Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical band gap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation displays. Herein, we present a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3 HPNCs. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4&#8208;hours autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed Pb leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8208;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold value of 1.24 &#956;J cm&#8722;2 and 8.58 &#956;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh strain&#8208;insensitive integrated hybrid electronics using highly stretchable bilayer liquid metal based conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, we introduce a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22,532 S/cm), extreme stretchability (2,260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1,000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8764; 200&#160;&#956;m. We demonstrate it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

         <title>Chemical tuning Meets Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#8901;xLiCl&#8901;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here we report an in&#8208;situ chemical tuning route to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#8901;xLiCl&#8901;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

Until recently, the crucial metal-organic magnet Cr(pyz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;LiCl&#8901;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;THF with considerable high coercivity and high-temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal-organic materials at room temperature. Here we report an in-situ chemical tuning route to realize the controllable transformation of low-temperature magnetic order into room-temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;LiCl&#8901;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;THF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room-temperature optimum performance of coercivity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room-temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr-pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lactate Oxidase&#8208;Instructed Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on L&#8208;lactate, its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate depletion based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia activated chemotherapy, H2O2 based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

Abstract
The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon&#8208;based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short&#8208;channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high&#8208;quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all&#8208;2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all&#8208;2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, we systemically review the unique properties of all&#8208;2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods and summarize the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics, respectively. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and challenges for all&#8208;2D vdW electronics, pointing out that how to improve the compatibility of 2D material devices with silicon&#8208;based industrial technology is a critical challenge.

         <title>Large&#8208;scale Ultra&#8208;robust MoS2 Patterns Directly Synthesized on Polymer Substrate for Flexible Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;area patterned MoS2 is considered the principle base for realizing high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based flexible electronic devices. Patterning and transferring MoS2 films to target flexible substrates, however, require conventional multi&#8208;step photolithography patterning and transferring process, despite tremendous progress in the facilitation of practical applications. Herein, we report an approach to directly synthesize large&#8208;scale MoS2 patterns that combines inkjet printing and thermal annealing. We prepare an optimal precursor ink that can deposit arbitrary patterns on polyimide films. By introducing a gas atmosphere of Ar/H2, thermal treatment at 350&#176;C enables an in&#8208;situ decomposition and crystallization in the patterned precursors and, consequently, results in the formation of MoS2. Without complicated processes, patterned MoS2 is obtained directly on polymer substrate, exhibiting superior mechanical flexibility and durability (&#8764;2% variation in resistance over 10,000 bending cycles) as well as excellent chemical stability, which we attribute to the generated continuous and thin microstructures as well as their strong adhesion with the substrate. As a step further, we employ this approach to manufacture various flexible sensing devices that are insensitive to body motions and moisture, including temperature sensors and biopotential sensing systems for real&#8208;time, continuously monitoring skin temperature, electrocardiography, and electromyography signals.

         <title>Ultralong Lifetime of Plasmon&#8208;Excited Electrons Realized in Nonepitaxial/Epitaxial Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 Triple&#8208;Heteronanocrystals</title>

Abstract
Combination of the strong light absorbing power of plasmonic metals with the superior charge carrier dynamics of halide perovskites is appealing for bio&#8208;inspired solar&#8208;energy conversion due to the potential to acquire long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced hot electrons. However, the direct coupling of these two materials, with Au/CsPbBr3 heteronanocrystals (HNCs) as a prototype, results in severe suppression of plasmon resonances. Here, we show that interfacial engineering is a key knob for overcoming this impediment, based on creation of a CdS mediate layer between Au and CsPbBr3 forming atomically organized Au&#8208;CdS and CdS&#8208;CsPbBr3 interfaces by nonepitaxial/epitaxial combined strategy. Transient spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the resulting Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 HNCs generate remarkably long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced charge carriers with lifetime up to nanosecond timescale, which is several orders of magnitude longer than those reported for colloidal plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor systems. Such long&#8208;lived carriers extracted from plasmonic antennas enable to drive CO2 photoreduction with efficiency outperforming previously reported CsPbBr3&#8208;based photocatalysts. Our findings disclose a new paradigm for achieving much elongated time windows to harness the substantial energy of transient plasmons through realization of synergistic coupling of plasmonic metals and halide perovskites.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) material is reported, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated. The enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability and long cycling life.








Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) is designed and synthesized, by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated. Compared with phenazine monomer, it is revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and an extremely long cycle life of 45&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Investigation of the charge&#8208;storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge&#8208;storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

Investigation of the charge-storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; first followed by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular-engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge-storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nonflammable High&#8208;Voltage 4.7 V Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

4.7 V Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 anode&#8208;free Li batteries with a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high capacity retention of 80% after 120 cycles are reported. With the nonflammable F&#8208;rich ionic liquid electrolyte and the seeding Si&#8208;PAN layer (950 nm), an enhanced safety and high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Li battery without dendritic Li growth is demonstrated.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries employ in situ lithium&#8208;plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and the safety issues of the flammable organic electrolytes. Here, a high&#8208;voltage 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal battery is reported,&#160;which uses&#160;a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8776;950&#160;nm) of silicon&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (Si&#8208;PAN, 25.5&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) as the negative electrode, a high&#8208;voltage cobalt&#8208;free LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, nonflammable ionic liquid electrolyte composed of 4.5&#160;m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py13FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive. The Si&#8208;PAN coating is found to seed the growth of lithium during charging, and reversibly expand/shrink during lithium plating/stripping over battery cycling. The wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window electrolyte containing a high concentration of FSI&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; facilitates the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, affording a 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery with a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 120 cycles). These results represent the first anode&#8208;free Li battery with a high 4.7&#160;V discharge voltage and high safety.

         <title>Shining Transparent Displays with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent displays have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. In this work, the novel narrow&#8208;band blue&#8208;emitting NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design for transparent display. The fabricated prototype can render &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle and large color gamut.








Abstract
Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity, and good reliability, and the TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8211;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and microstructural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;c&#160;&#8776; 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;cfs&#160;&#8776; 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (S&#160;&#8776; 3; &#295;&#969;&#160;&#8776; 285 cm&#8722;1), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (Ea&#160;&#8776; 0.43&#160;eV) for NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ emission and layered architecture for screen film. These findings establish fundamental guidelines for narrow&#8208;band emitting materials design and shine light on superior TD innovative development.

         <title>Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The roles of electrode materials and interfaces in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices are discussed&#160;in terms of perovskite stability. The various factors responsible for rapid degradation in PSCs are provided. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials for carbon&#8208;based PSC as a substitute for noble metals are addressed, along with the recent progress.








Abstract
Exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved, which is comparable with their traditional rivals (Si&#8208;based solar cells). However, commercialization&#8208;worthy efficiency and long&#8208;term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs are discussed in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. All the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs is presented. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals are focused on, along with the recent research progress in carbon&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub&#8208;category of PSCs, that is, flexible PSCs, is considered as a type of exceptional power source due to their high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and figures of merit for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Last, the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs are discussed, with an emphasis on their commercialization.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relation between morphology&#8211;structure and applications is intricate in covalent organic frameworks. This review highlights the progressive utilization of morphology&#8211;structure design toward the success of various applications. Furthermore, an outlook is put forward for improving the material performance by controlling the morphology&#8211;application design space.








Abstract
Translating the performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano&#8208; to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize, and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology versus application will help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. 2D and 3D frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, the carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. However, the research on COF chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications are provided. In each case, the underlying role of morphology is unveiled. Toward the end, a correlation between morphology and application is provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In&#8208;situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reaches to 3.57&#215;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than three&#8208;fold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#215;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1) and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8208;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (&gt; 200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, we succeeded in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with TEM by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization had not been carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images revealed robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also revealed the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;functional Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on the Comprehensive Integration and Synergetic Utilization of Triboelectrification, Electrostatic Induction and Electrostatic Discharge to Achieve AC/DC Convertible Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditional alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which are implemented via the pairwise coupling of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, have been widely explored in various fields. In this work, we realize the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge in a single device for the first time, achieving a dual&#8208;functional TENG (DF&#8208;TENG) to produce an AC/DC convertible output. Distinguishing from the conventional TENGs, the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic discharge enables charge circulation between the dielectric tribo&#8208;layers, while electrostatic induction realizes charge transfer in the external circuit. This novel energy conversion mechanism has been proven to be applicable to a variety of materials, including polymers, fabrics, and semiconductors. The output mode of the DF&#8208;TENG can be tuned by adjusting the slider motion state, and its constant output current and power density can reach 1.51 mA m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 and 398 mW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, respectively, which are the highest records reported for constant DC&#8208;TENGs to date. This work not only provides a paradigm shift to achieve AC/DC convertible output, but it also exhibits high potential for extending the TENG design philosophy.

         <title>Injectable Anti&#8208;inflammatory Supramolecular Nanofiber Hydrogel to Promote Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy in Age&#8208;Related Macular Degeneration Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and severe vision loss worldwide, while the currently available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated both inflammation and oxidative stress&#8208;induced damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are involved in the pathogenesis of aberrant development of blood vessels in wet AMD (wet&#8208;AMD). Although anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (e.g., Ranibizumab) can impair the growth of new blood vessels, side effects were still found with repeated monthly intravitreal injections. Here, an injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by simply mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), a clinic anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, anti&#8208;VEGF, the gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;VEGF drug for AMD treatment, with CaCl2. Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP&#8208;based hydrogel (BetP&#8208;Gel) while enabling long&#8208;term sustained release of anti&#8208;VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization (CNV), could also scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP&#8208;Gel could dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy. Notably, our anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti&#8208;VEGF therapy.

         <title>Thermoelectric effect mediated cancer Thermoelectric therapy and surgical adjuvant treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As an indispensable strategy for tumor treatment, surgery may cause two major challenges: tumor recurrence and wound infection. Here, a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction&#8208;based thermoelectric therapeutic strategy is provided as either an independent cancer therapy or surgical adjuvant treatment. P&#8208;type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (BST) and n&#8208;type Bi2Te2.8Se0.2 (BTS) nanoplates composed of Z&#8208;scheme thermoelectric heterojunction (BST/BTS) are fabricated via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal processes. The contact between BST and BTS constructs an interfacial electric field due to the effect of Fermi energy level rearrangement, guiding electrons in the conductive band (CB) of BTS combine with the holes in the valance band (VB) of BST, leaving stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of separated electrons and holes in the CB of BST and the VB of BTS, respectively. Moreover, under a mild temperature gradient, another self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field is formed facilitating the migration of electrons and holes to their surfaces. Based on the PEGylated BST/BTS heterojunction, a novel thermoelectric therapy platform is developed through intravenous injection of BST/BTS and external cooling of the tumors. This thermoelectric strategy is also proved effective for combination cancer therapy with &#946;&#8208;elemene. Moreover, the combination of heterojunction and hydrogel is administrated on the surface of the wound after surgery, achieving efficient residual tumor treatment and antibacterial effects.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Engineering of Conductive Fillers towards Enhanced Dielectric Properties: Universal Polarization Mechanism in Polymer Conductor Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (k) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this paper, we study a series of core&#8208;shell polymer composites, and investigate the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers). It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers&#8208; essentially a domain&#8208;type polarization. Formation of core&#8208;shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of polymer composites by essentially modifying the filler&#8208;cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher&#8208;than&#8208;normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high&#8208;k due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core&#8208;shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core&#8208;shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this paper, we study a series of core-shell polymer composites, and investigate the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers). It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers- essentially a domain-type polarization. Formation of core-shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of polymer composites by essentially modifying the filler-cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher-than-normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core-shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core-shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells through Pentylammonium Acetate Modification with certified efficiency of 23.35%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, rigid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous development owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.7%. However, the record PCE of flexible PSCs (&#8764;22.4%) still lags far behind their rigid counterparts and their mechanical stabilities are also not satisfactory. Herein, we report a highly efficient and stable flexible inverted PSC through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via Pentylammonium Acetate (PenAAc) molecule. Through synthetic manipulation of anion and cation, we show that the PenA+ and Ac&#713; have strong chemical binding with both acceptor and donor defects of surface&#8208;terminating ends on perovskite films. The PenAAc modified flexible PSCs achieved a record PCE of 23.68% (0.08 cm2, certified: 23.35%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17&#160;V. Large&#8208;area devices (1.0 cm2) also realized an exceptional PCE of 21.52%. Moreover, the fabricated devices showed excellent stability under mechanical bending, with PCE remaining above 91% of the original PCE even after 5000 bends.

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, we investigate various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic&#8208;crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous&#8208;structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion&#8208;conducting, plastic&#8208;crystal pathways with long&#8208;range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8764;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) at 25&#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi0.83Mn0.06Co0.11O2 (NMC&#8208;83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1. The established structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid&#8208;state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next-generation battery technology that can surpass conventional lithium-ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, we investigate various plastic crystal-embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) with different phase-separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure-property-electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Design of the Metal&#8208;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(M)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Switchable metal&#8208;organic frameworks change their structure in time and selectively open their pores adsorbing guest molecules, leading to highly selective separation, pressure amplification, sensing, and actuation applications. The three&#8208;dimensional engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks has reached a high level of maturity, but spatiotemporal evolution opens a new perspective towards engineering materials in the 4th dimension (time) by t&#8208;axis design, in essence exploiting the deliberate tuning of activation barriers. This work demonstrates the first example in which an explicit temporal engineering of a switchable metal&#8208;organic framework (DUT&#8208;8, [M1M2(2,6&#8208;ndc)2dabco]n, 2,6&#8208;ndc = 2,6,&#8208;naphthalene dicarboxylate, dabco = 1,4 diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, M1 = Ni, M2 = Co) is presented. The temporal response is deliberately tuned by variations in cobalt content. We present a spectrum of advanced analytical methods for analyzing the switching kinetics stimulated by vapor adsorption using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved techniques ranging from ensemble adsorption and advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments to individual crystal analysis. A novel analysis technique based on microscopic observation of individual crystals in a microfluidic channel reveals the lowest limit for adsorption switching reported so far. Differences in the spatiotemporal response of crystal ensembles originate from an induction time that varies statistically and widens characteristically with increasing cobalt content reflecting increasing activation barriers.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Assisted Cobalt Ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice strain generated by Zn&#8208;doped CoTe2 polyhedra balances the intrinsic catalytic effect and the adsorption of polysulfides, and the catalytic mechanism for accelerating polysulfide conversion is verified in combination with d&#8208;band center theory, Bader charge, and Gibbs free energy. It offers a guiding idea for the device of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and with lean electrolytes. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC is constructed after zinc atoms are uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that a change of the coordination environment for the cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high sonodynamic therapy efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.








Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, resulting in redshifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, it is found that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs (nanoparticles of BAnTh&#160;and BTeTh) shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of High&#8208;Quality Graphene Films via Electrostatic&#8208;Repulsion Aligning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films are assembled from pristine graphene nanosheets via electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning where highly electronegative titania nanosheets play a key role. The obtained graphene films present significantly enhanced mechanical properties and electrical properties for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal&#8208;management multifunctional applications in smart and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Assembling pristine graphene into freestanding films featuring high electrical conductivity, superior flexibility, and robust mechanical strength aims at meeting the all&#8208;around high criteria of new&#8208;generation electronics. However, voids and defects produced in the macroscopic assembly process of graphene nanosheets severely degrade the performance of graphene films, and mechanical brittleness often limits their applications in wide scenarios. To address such challenges, an electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning strategy is demonstrated to produce highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films. Typically, the high electronegativity of titania nanosheets (TiNS) induces the aligning of negatively charged graphene nanosheets via electrostatic repulsion in the film assembly. The resultant graphene films show fine microstructure, enhanced mechanical properties, and improved electrical conductivity up to 1.285 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1. Moreover, the graphene films can withstand 5000 repeated folding without structural damage and electrical resistance fluctuation. These comprehensive improved properties, combined with the facile synthesis method and scalable production, make these graphene films a promising platform for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal&#8208;management applications in smart and wearable electronics.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;Suspended Graphene Grown on a Si Wafer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a precisely designed interface&#8208;decoupling strategy, quasi&#8208;suspended graphene can be grown directly on a 4 inch Si wafer. The obtained Gr/Si sample enables transfer&#8208;free fabrication of graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor devices with high electronic performance and a carrier mobility up to 15&#8239;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The direct growth of graphene affording wafer&#8208;scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, the metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free growth of quasi&#8208;suspended graphene on a Si wafer is demonstrated using an interface&#8208;decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower&#8208;than&#8208;conventional H2 dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine&#8208;tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer&#8208;level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4 inch Si wafer enables the transfer&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi&#8208;suspended feature of the graphene. Moreover, a carrier mobility up to 15 000 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 can be attained. This study is anticipated to offer meaningful insights into the synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality graphene on dielectrics for practical graphene devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable dynamic passivation strategy by incorporating a photoisomeric molecule is put forward, which greatly enhances the photostability of perovskite photovoltaics. This dynamic strategy pays attention to and well matches the dynamics of defect generation during operation. The characteristics of the changeable molecular structure enable us to cope with defects updated in operation without introducing excess active sites.








Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, a passivation molecule should exist in the configuration that would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration that possesses the passivation sites. Herein, a classical photoisomeric molecule, spiropyran, is adopted, whose pre&#8208; and post&#8208;isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photoinduced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal of defects. Consequently, spiropyrans work as light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defect repair. The target devices retain 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonfullerene organic solar cells based on quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804;10 wt.%) are fabricated. A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.








Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.

         <title>Dense Local Triplet States and Steric Shielding of a Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enable High&#8208;Performance Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.132, 0.092), narrow full width at half maximum of 22&#160;nm, and high external quantum efficiency of 23.4% is developed by introducing bulky biphenyls and N&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;N&#8208;ortho&#8208;dimethylphenylamine that create dense local triplet states and suppress intramolecular aggregation. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules based on boron and nitrogen atoms are emerging as next&#8208;generation blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrow emission spectra and triplet harvesting properties. However, intermolecular aggregation stemming from the planar structure of typical MR&#8208;TADF molecules that leads to concentration quenching and broadened spectra limits the utilization of the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Herein, a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me, is developed to suppress intermolecular interactions effectively. Furthermore, photophysical investigation and theoretical calculations reveal that adding biphenyl moieties to the core body creates dense local triplet states in the vicinity of S1 and T1 energetically, letting the emitter harvest excitons efficiently. OLEDs based on pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure&#8208;blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;wt%. Furthermore, by incorporating a conventional TADF sensitizer, deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1% are realized. These findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation.

         <title>Polymeric Single&#8208;Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side&#8208;Chain Motion for High&#8208;Performance Solid Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC) based on heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers high ionic conductivity with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number, leading to high&#8208;performance solid zinc batteries.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) is achieved. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life. In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 d), low self&#8208;discharge rate, and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion&#8208;transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol is achieved in a flow&#8208;cell, which is enabled by V&#8208;doped Cu2Se hierarchical nanotubes. The hierarchical nanotubes meet the requirement for flow&#8208;cells while the V doping steers the reaction pathway toward ethanol production.








Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products is heavily pursued because of their commercial values, and the efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. A flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, it is reported that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cells and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by the experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and, as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens an avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>In situ Observation of Structural Evolution and Phase Engineering of Amorphous Materials during Crystal Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation from the amorphous phase is probed at the atomic scale through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Three distinct stages, including aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals, are observed. Unconventional crystal phases, e.g., fcc Ru, hcp Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo, are formed through nucleation from the corresponding amorphous C&#8208;doped metal nanosheets.








Abstract
The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation.

&lt;p&gt;Nucleation from the amorphous phase is probed at the atomic scale through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Three distinct stages, including aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice-expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice-expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals, are observed. Unconventional crystal phases, e.g., fcc Ru, hcp Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo, are formed through nucleation from the corresponding amorphous C-doped metal nanosheets.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation. The amorphous structure, as one of the intermediate phases during nucleation, plays an important role in modulating the nucleation pathway. However, the process and mechanism of crystal nucleation from amorphous structures still need to be fully investigated. Here, in situ aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is employed to conduct real-time imaging of the nucleation of ultrathin amorphous nanosheets (NSs). The results indicate that their nucleation contains three distinct stages, i.e., aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice-expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice-expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Quaternary 2D BiCuSeO p&#8208;Type Semiconductor with Intrinsic Degeneracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets with heteroanionic crystal structure are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Its intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy is systemically revealed and leveraged for fabricating 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors. These results significantly boost the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of tunnel devices.








Abstract
2D BiCuSeO is an intrinsic p&#8208;type degenerate semiconductor due to its self&#8208;doping effect, which possesses great potential to fabricate high&#8208;performance 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs). However, the controllable synthesis of multinary 2D materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still a challenge due to the restriction of thermodynamics. Here, the CVD synthesis of quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets is realized. As&#8208;grown BiCuSeO nanosheets with thickness down to &#8776;6.1&#160;nm (&#8776;7 layers) and domain size of &#8776;277&#160;&#181;m show excellent ambient stability. Intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, capable of maintaining even in a few layers, is comprehensively unveiled. By varying the thicknesses and temperatures, the carrier concentration of BiCuSeO nanosheets can be adjusted in the range of 1019 to 1021 cm&#8722;3, and the Hall mobility of BiCuSeO is &#8776;191 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (at 2 K). Furthermore, taking advantage of the p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, a prototypical BiCuSeO/MoS2 TFET is fabricated. The emergence of the negative differential resistance trend and multifunctional diodes by modulating the gate voltage and temperature reveal the great practical implementation potential of BiCuSeO nanosheets. These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high&#8208;performance tunnel devices.

         <title>Activating C&#8211;H Bonds by Tuning Fe Sites and an Interfacial Effect for Enhanced Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (NTAs) photoanode is developed for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The superiority of the co&#8208;edged FeO6 octahedral structure in the Formox process is demonstrated. Impressively, the heterostructure and the interfacial effect of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 and CoFe2O4 facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, resulting in superior PEC methanol conversion efficiency and formaldehyde selectivity.








Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, a simple two&#8208;step strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction are investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8211;H bond activation, and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>The Negative&#8208;Charge Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; Between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after active ions intercalation is highly undesirable yet inevitable, which can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large&#8208;sized AlCl4&#8722; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, we have come out with an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups onto the surface of MXene film, rich negative charges region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This has helped to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50,000 times. We believe the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, we synthesize Janus microdroplets through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8764; 14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;power Vertical Transistors for Multilevel Decoding Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors with parallel transmission and learning functions are of interest in the development of brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. However, the poor performance and high power consumption are the two main issues limiting their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate an ultralow&#8208;power vertical transistor based on MXene and organic single crystal. The transistor exhibits a high JON of 16.6&#160;mA/cm2 and a high JON/JOFF ratio of 9.12 &#215; 105 under an ultralow working voltage of &#8208;1&#160;mV. Furthermore, it can successfully simulate the functions of biological synapse under electrical modulation along with consuming only 8.7 aJ of power per spike. It also permits multilevel information decoding modes with a significant gap between the readable time of professionals and non&#8208;professionals, producing a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio up to 114.15&#160;dB. This work encourages the use of vertical transistors and organic single crystal in decoding information and advances the development of low&#8208;power neuromorphic systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, we raised a rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td &gt; 400&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell showed a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibited a high capacity retention (&#8764;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward-looking materials for large-scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, we raised a rational concept of high-entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI-ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well-known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor-made HEMI-ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro- and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy.

         <title>Unlock the potassium storage behaviour of single&#8208;Phased tungsten selenide nanorods via large cation insertion</title>

Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, we first investigate the energy&#8208;storage behaviour and decisively associate them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K-based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K-ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, we first investigate the energy-storage behaviour and decisively associate them with the capacity-degradation of the promising layer-structured WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from an integrated chemical and physical point of view.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, we synthesize dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and non&#8208;responsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, we show robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a non&#8208;responsive matrix allows us to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in-plane or out-of-plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, we synthesize dually responsive, spindle-shaped micro-actuators from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro-actuators are embedded in a conventional and non-responsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in-plane orientation in local regions, we show robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro-actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulated Moir&#233; Perovskite for Stable Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Polarization Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanostructures provide a simple, effective, and low&#8208;cost route to enhance the light&#8208;trapping capability of optoelectronic devices. In recent years, nano&#8208;optical structures have been widely used in perovskite optoelectronic devices to greatly enhance the device performance. However, the inherent instability of perovskite materials hinders the practical application of these nanostructured optoelectronic devices. Here, we fabricated in&#8208;situ encapsulated moir&#233; lattice perovskite photodetectors by two nanograting&#8208;structured soft templates with relative rotation angles. The confinement growth of the two nanograting templates leads to crystal growth with moir&#233; lattice structure, which improves the light&#8208;harvesting ability of the perovskite crystal, thereby improving the device performance. The photodetector exhibits responsivity to 1026.5 A W&#8722;1. The Moir&#233; lattice&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based photodetector maintained 95% of the initial performance after 223 d. After being continuously sprayed with water moist for 180 minutes, the performance was maintained at 95.7% of its initial level. The nanograting structure endows the device with high polarization sensitivity of Imax/Imin as high as 9.1.

         <title>Probiotic&#8208;inspired nanomedicine restores intestinal homeostasis in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Microbiota&#8208;based therapeutics offer innovative strategies to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, the poor clinical outcome so far and the limited flexibility of the bacterial approach call for improvement. Inspired by the health benefits of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of bowel diseases, we designed bioartificial probiotics to restore the intestinal microenvironment in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome. The bioartificial probiotic comprises two components: an E. coli Nissle 1917&#8208;derived membrane (EM) as the surface and the biodegradable diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SeM) as the core. When orally administered, the probiotic&#8208;inspired nanomedicine (SeM@EM) adhered strongly to the mucus layer and restored intestinal redox balance and immune regulation homeostasis in a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically altered the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This work suggests a safe and effective nanomedicine that can restore intestinal homeostasis for IBDs therapy.

Inspired by the health benefits of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of bowel diseases, we designed bioartificial probiotics to restore the intestinal microenvironment in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome. The bioartificial probiotic comprises two components: an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; Nissle 1917-derived membrane (EM) as the surface and the biodegradable diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SeM) as the core. When orally administered, the probiotic-inspired nanomedicine (SeM@EM) adhered strongly to the mucus layer and restored intestinal redox balance and immune regulation homeostasis in a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically altered the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This work suggests a safe and effective nanomedicine that can restore intestinal homeostasis for IBDs therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmable wavefront control in the visible spectrum using low&#8208;loss chalcogenide phase change metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces provide unique solutions for advanced wavefront manipulation of light with complete control of amplitude and phase at sub&#8208;wavelength scales. One limitation, however, for most of these devices is the lack of any post&#8208;fabrication tunability of their response. To break this limit, a promising approach is employing phase&#8208;change&#8208;materials (PCM), which provide a fast, low energy and non&#8208;volatile means to endow metasurfaces with a switching mechanism. In this regard, great advancements have been done in the mid infrared and near infrared spectrum using different chalcogenides. In the visible spectral range, however, very few devices have demonstrated full phase manipulation, high efficiencies, and reversible optical modulation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a programmable all&#8208;dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurface made of antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) PCM, a low loss and high&#8208;index material in the visible spectral range with a large contrast (&#8764;0.5) between its amorphous and crystalline states. We show &#8764;2&#960; phase modulation with high associated transmittance and use it to create programmable beam steering devices. These novel chalcogenide PCM metasurfaces have the potential to emerge as a platform for next generation spatial light modulators and to impact application areas such as programmable and adaptive flat optics, LiDAR, and many more.

         <title>Bioinspired Chiral Template Guided Mineralization for Biophotonic Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired artificial molting strategy based on self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals and subsequent mineralization is developed to produce biomimetic photonic structural composites. These biomimetic composites exhibit tunable mechanics from &#8220;strong and flexible&#8221; to &#8220;stiff and hard,&#8221; as well as tunable chiral structural color and water&#8208;triggered switchable photonics that are absent in most artificial mineralized materials.








Abstract
Nature provides numerous biomineral design inspirations for constructing structural materials with desired functionalities. However, large&#8208;scale production of damage&#8208;tolerant Bouligand structural materials with biologically comparable photonics remains a longstanding challenge. Here, an efficient and scalable artificial molting strategy, based on self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals and subsequent mineralization of amorphous calcium carbonate, is developed to produce biomimetic materials with an exceptional combination of mechanical and photonic properties that are usually mutually exclusive in synthetic materials. These biomimetic composites exhibit tunable mechanics from &#8220;strong and flexible&#8221;, which&#160;exceeds the benchmark of natural chiral materials, to &#8220;stiff and hard&#8221;, which is comparable to natural and synthetic counterparts. Especially, the biomimetic composites possess ultrahigh stiffness of 2&#160;GPa in their fully water&#8208;swollen state&#8212;a value well beyond hydrated crab exoskeleton, cartilage, tendon, and stiffest synthetic hydrogels, combined with exceptional strength and resilience. Additionally, these composites are distinguished by the tunable chiral structural color and water&#8208;triggered switchable photonics that are absent in most artificial mineralized materials, as well as unique hydroplastic properties. This study opens the door for a scalable synthesis of resilient biophotonic structural materials in practical bulk form.

         <title>Emerging Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Oxides: From Synthesis to Device Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal oxides have aroused increasing attention in the field of electronics and optoelectronics due to their intriguing physical properties. In this review paper, an overview of recent advances on synthesis of 2D metal oxides and their electronic applications is presented. First, the tunable physical properties of 2D metal oxides that related to the structure (various oxidation&#8208;state forms, polymorphism, etc.), crystalline and defects (anisotropy, point defects, and grain boundary), and thickness (quantum confinement effect, interfacial effect, etc.) are discussed. Then, advanced synthesis method for 2D metal oxides besides mechanical exfoliation are introduced and classified into solution process, vapor phase deposition, and native oxidation on metal source. Later, the various roles of 2D metal oxides in widespread applications, i.e., transistors, inverters, photodetectors, piezotronics, memristors, and potential applications (solar cell, spintronics and superconducting devices) are discussed. Finally, the outlook of existing challenges and future opportunities in 2D metal oxides are proposed.

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexocatalysis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalysis is vitally important for chemical engineering, energy and environment. It is critical to discover new mechanisms for efficient catalysis. For piezoelectric/pyroelectric/ferroelectric materials that have a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, interfacial polarization induced redox reactions at surfaces leads to advanced mechanocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the first flexocatalysis for two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric semiconductors, such as MnO2 nanosheets, largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based&#8208;mechanocatalysis to two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric materials. Under ultrasonic excitation, the reactive species are created due to the strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric polarization in MnO2 nanosheets composed nanoflowers. The organic pollutants (MB et&#160;al.) can be effectively degraded within 5 minutes, the performance of the flexocatalysis is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Moreover, the factors related to flexocatalysis such as material morphology, adsorption, mechanical vibration intensity, and temperature are explored, which give deep insights into the mechanocatalysis. This study opens the field of flexoelectric effect based mechanochemistry in two&#8208;dimensional centrosymmetric semiconductors.

         <title>Unraveling the Stretch&#8208;induced Microstructural Evolution and Morphology&#8208;Stretchability Relationships of High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The stretchability and stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) are pivotal for their collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and they are mainly affected by the complex morphology of active layers. Herein, a highly ductile conjugated polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) was incorporated into the active layers of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptors to simultaneously investigate the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties and structural evolution under stretching of ternary blend films with various acceptor contents. The structural robustness of the blend films was indicated by their stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution, which was monitored in real&#8208;time by a combination of in&#8208;situ wide/small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. We found that adding the soft P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) can enhance the stretchability and structural robustness of ternary blend films by increasing entangled chains and tie chains to dissipate strain. Furthermore, the stretchability of the ternary blends can be superbly predicted by the three&#8208;dimensional equivalent box model. This work provides instructive insight and guidance for designing stretchable electronics and predicting the stretchability of multi&#8208;component blends.

Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8208;discharge speed and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, we report the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on introducion of inorganic fillers. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking strutures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies &gt; 90% at 150&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, have been comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing feature have been demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes and low gain coefficients. Here, we employ PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300 &#956;J.cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180 cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, we demonstrate a significant reduction of optical gain threshold, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8211;exciton population per dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45 due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led us to attain a 5&#8208;fold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE= 0.70 excitons per dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, we use these heterostructured QDs to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton per dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las = 0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, albeit starting with an 8&#8208;fold degenerate system and paves the way towards solution processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal Free Spintronic System with Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Ferromagnetic Topological Surface State of FeSi Above Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strongly spin&#8208;orbit coupled states at metal interfaces, topological insulators and two&#8208;dimensional materials enable efficient electric control of spin states, offering great potential for spintronics. However, there are still materials challenges to overcome, including the integration into advanced silicon electronics and the scarce resources of constituent heavy elements of those materials. Through magneto&#8208;transport measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations, here we demonstrate robust spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC)&#8208;induced properties of a ferromagnetic topological surface state in FeSi and their controllability via hybridization with adjacent materials. In comparison to the case of its naturally oxidized surface, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is greatly increased beyond room temperature and the effective SOC strength is almost doubled at the surface in proximity to a wide&#8208;bandgap fluoride insulator. Those enhanced magnetic properties enable room&#8208;temperature magnetization switching, being applicable to spin&#8208;orbit torque based spintronic devices. Realization of strong SOC in the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free silicon&#8208;based compound will accelerate spintronic applications.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, Long&#8208;Range Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides and two crystalline cobalt oxides are studied in&#160;situ to deduce the role of the reconstruction conditions, the effect of the electrolyte, and structure&#8211;activity relations for near&#8208;neutral water oxidation. Multiple aspects are considered and interconnected, deducing a comprehensive concept for the different electrocatalytic performances, including mass transport.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short&#8208;range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#183;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass&#8208;transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near&#8208;neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;month without degrading performance.

         <title>Machine Learning for Optical Scanning Probe Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three main paradigms of machine learning&#8212;supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning&#8212;can be applied to optical scanning probe techniques in future instrumentation and data analysis to solve unique problems.








Abstract
The ability to perform nanometer&#8208;scale optical imaging and spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low&#8208;energy effects in quantum materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological samples. These tasks can be accomplished by the scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) technique that has recently spread to many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. Herein, it is shown that the s&#8208;SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in many ways from artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) and machine&#8208;learning (ML) algorithms. Augmented with AI&#8208; and ML&#8208;enhanced data acquisition and analysis, scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate, and intelligent.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Efficient, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are developed by designing a new series of polymer donors (PDs, PhAm) featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable flexible spacers. High power conversion efficiency (PCE = 12.7%) and stretchability (PCE retention of &gt; 80% at 32% strain) are demonstrated, which represent the best performances in terms of both PCE and stretchability among the IS&#8208;OSCs reported to date.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (N1,N3&#8208;bis((5&#8208;bromothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)isophthalamide, PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions is developed. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention of &gt;80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. It is also found that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

         <title>An Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a new type of vascular&#8208;like ITD with artificial adhesion repertoires and a wireless magnetothermal response for high metastatic circulating tumor cell removal in vivo is proposed. The ITD implanted in the artery mainly comprises PLLA fibers encapsulated with FeCo@G and a 3D structure with HA and gelatin for the preparation of bioinspired adhesive sites.








Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITDs, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo is presented. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, this work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable nanostructure is developed and assessed for outstanding biofilm disruption effect by capturing bacteria and penetrating biofilm matrix of guanidinium, and the synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic effect. The remotely controlled nanostructure efficiently clears infection and mediates the inflammation resolution in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;infected osteomyelitis, thus providing a novel sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy for osteomyelitis.








Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8226;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, the biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and the subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to M2&#8208;type while suppressing the M1&#8208;type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the fast synthesis of fully conjugated phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The as&#8208;prepared COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries with the achievement of a high reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;due to their good conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature.








Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (BBTC) and quinoxalino[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (QPPTC) in ZnCl2&#160;leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8211;1.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 100&#160;cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;for over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles.

In this work, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated structure is in situ injected into layered Ti&#8208;based MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. The assembled ZIBs exhibit ultralong cycle stability and display impressive potential for electronic devices.








Abstract
Organic molecules have been considered promising energy&#8208;storage materials in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but are plagued by poor conductivity and structural instability because of the short&#8208;range conjugated structure and low molecular weight. Herein, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated effects along the C&#63742;N backbones is proposed, which is in situ injected into layered MXene to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. Theoretical and electrochemical analyses reveal a selective H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism in TAP, which is ascribed to the steric effect on the availability of active C&#63742;N sites. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx, as a conductive scaffold, favors fast Zn2+ diffusion to boost the electrode kinetics of TAP. Close electronic interactions between TAP and Ti3C2Tx preserve the structural integrity of TAP/Ti3C2Tx during the repeated charge/discharge. Accordingly, the TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.04 A g&#8722;1 in aqueous ZIBs, which also realizes an ultralong lifetime over 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 81.6%. Furthermore, flexible Zn||TAP/Ti3C2Tx batteries with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrate potential application in wearable electronic devices. This work offers pivotal guidance to create highly stable organic electrodes for advanced ZIBs.

         <title>Donor End&#8208;Capped Alkyl Chain Length Dependent Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MPhS&#8208;C2 with shortened terminal alkyl chain, features thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condense packing, leading to suppressed upshifts of highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and efficient charge transport at small phase separation in BTP&#8208;eC9 blended devices, obtaining the highest PCE of 17.11% with &#916;Vnr of 0.192 V in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
A critical bottleneck for further efficiency breakthroughs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is to minimize the non&#8208;radiative energy loss (e&#916;Vnr) while maximizing the charge generation. With the development of highly emissive low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, the design of high&#8208;performance donors becomes critical to enable the blend with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency to approach or surpass the pristine acceptor. Herein, by shortening the end&#8208;capped alkyl chains of the small&#8208;molecular donors from hexyl (MPhS&#8208;C6) to ethyl (MPhS&#8208;C2), the material obtained aggregation that was&#160;insensitive to thermal annealing (TA) along with&#160;condensed packing simultaneously. The former leads to small phase separation and suppressed upshifts of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and the latter facilitates its efficient charge&#8208;transport at aggregation&#8208;less packing. Hence, the &#916;Vnr decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS&#8208;C6 to MPhS&#8208;C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8&#8208;diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high Jsc (26.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Voc (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;Vnr (0.192&#160;V) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;Vnr.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Curable Acrylic Resins toward UV&#8208;Light&#8208;Blocking Adhesives for Foldable Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acrylic resin that can be efficiently polymerized using visible light in the presence of oxygen and UV&#8208;abosrbers is presented, which can be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking optically clear adhesives (OCAs) applicable in flexible displays. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized.








Abstract
Current technological advances in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode panel design of foldable smartphones demand advanced adhesives with UV&#8208;blocking abilities, beyond their conventional roles of bonding objects and relieving deformation stress. However, optically clear adhesives (OCAs) with UV&#8208;blocking ability cannot be prepared using conventional UV&#8208;curing methods relying on a photoinitiator. Herein, a new acrylic resin that can be efficiently cured using visible light without oxygen removal is presented, which may be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking OCAs for use in current flexible displays. A novel photocatalyst and a specific combination of additives facilitate sufficiently rapid curing under visible light in the presence of UV&#8208;absorbers. Only a very small amount of the highly active photocatalyst is required to prepare UV&#8208;blocking OCA films with very high transparency in the visible region. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized. This technology can also be utilized in other applications that require highly efficient visible light curing, such as optically clear resins, dental resins, and 3D/4D&#8208;printable materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact model connecting measurable material properties and device dimensions to circuit behavior of locally active memristors is presented, thus enabling rapid screening of neuromorphic materials for desired applications.








Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here, the principle of local activity is used to build a model of VO2/SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasistatic and dynamic electrical and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal data obtained via in situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, the model is distilled to measurable material properties, and device scaling laws are established. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which this model is developed has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe Superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase&#8208;Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ crystallized Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization mechanism.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement.

&lt;p&gt;An in situ crystallized Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in-plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt-quenching-free amorphization mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)-oriented face-centered-cubic (FCC) Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; alloy and subsequent melt-quenching-free amorphization. The in-plane compressive stress, induced by the SL-to-FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)-oriented FCC structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulate Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized two&#8208;enzyme nanoparticles are constructed using GOx, Mn2+, and HA (GOx&#8208;Mn/HA). GOx&#8208;Mn/HA can target the tumor site and, self&#8208;amplifying, regulate the tumor glycometabolism to cause tumor cell pyroptosis and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression. GOx&#8208;Mn/HA is further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to treat tumors, which can effectively inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. In this work,&#160;regulating tumor glycometabolism is found to induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy is investigated here. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method is used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It has the ability to self&#8208;amplify regulation of the glycometabolism of tumor cells. It can also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, nanoparticles are further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibits tumor development and significantly increases &#160;the survival time of mice. Combination therapy also has a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is thought to be the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immunocheckpoint blocking in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy can have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic-migration-mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single-phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments.

In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature-control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature-control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>

Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

Robotic Skin
In article number 2204805, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive robotic skin with an augmented pressure&#8208;sensing capability beyond that of human skin. The robotic skin is composed of gallium microgranules fabricated uniformly using a T&#8208;junction microfluidic system. Through the phase transition of gallium microgranules, it achieves a higher sensitivity in the soft mode and a broader dynamic range in the rigid mode compared to human skin.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2205674, Kang Liang and co&#8208;workers develop a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered single&#8208;atom catalysts via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8208;organic frameworks followed by pyrolysis. The enhanced activity of the obtained catalysts benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, the mesopores, and the regulated coordination environment of the single&#8208;atom active sites induced by the metalloproteins.

Confined 2D Channels
2D&#8208;material membranes have demonstrated great potential in molecular separation. In article number 2206349, Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers rationally confine metal into sub&#8208;nanometer GO galleries, endowing 2D channels with molecular recognition and sieving properties for discriminating ethylene over ethane.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confined 2D Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D-material membranes have demonstrated great potential in molecular separation. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202206349"&gt;2206349&lt;/a&gt;, Gongping Liu and co-workers rationally confine metal into sub-nanometer GO galleries, endowing 2D channels with molecular recognition and sieving properties for discriminating ethylene over ethane. The metal confined in a 2D nanostructure would be of interest in other fields such as single-atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.

Light&#8208;Emitting Devices
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Yasumitsu Miyata, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203250 using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7 eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor alloy based broadband optoelectronic device applications.

Proteomics
In article number 2206008, Omid C. Farokhzad, Daniel Hornburg, and co&#8208;workers show how the Vroman effect can be leveraged to capture the complexity of human proteomes using engineered nanoparticles. Protein corona formation dynamics demonstrate how nanoparticle functionalization and nano&#8211;bio binding competition enable deep and quantitative interrogation of biosamples. This facilitates increased capture of low&#8208;abundance proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, enabling new strategies for biomarker discovery and personalized nanomedicine.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides opening the black box of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N) doping in graphdiyne, the relationship between N configurations and reaction routes in CO2 reduction is clarified. The sp&#8208;N atoms would induce high selectivity toward CH4 generation, owing to the optimized adsorption of precursor and intermediate. This work would guide the site&#8208;defined doping in carbon materials for advanced catalysts.








Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site&#8208;defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule is realized, and finally sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 toward CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp-C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N), bringing a Pt-comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site-defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal-free catalysts. After the four-year study, the fabrication of intermediate-like molecule is realized, and finally sp-N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp-N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toward CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp-N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black-box for the site-defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis and Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered polymeric adsorbent (SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively adsorb chemo exposure in the GI tract is developed. The SPORA&#8208;SN9 sharply decreases the toxic chemo content of the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen, thereby preventing chemo&#8208;induced GI mucositis and chemo&#8208;induced microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the protected gut microbiome improves the antitumor efficacy of the followed immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) is reported, which can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protects the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced organic synapse with single&#8208;polarity presynaptic voltage driven facilitation and depression is reported. The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte&#8208;electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret&#8208;charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.
