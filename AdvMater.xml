      <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salts: Crystalline Porous Organic Salts: From Micropore to Hierarchical Pores (Adv. Mater. 44/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) with a microporous polarized channel system offer a large array of fascinating properties including proton conductivity, CO2 diffusion, colossal negative linear compressibility, and molecular rotors, as reviewed by Li&#8208;Hua Chen, Teng Ben, Bao&#8208;Lian Su, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2003270. The introduction of hierarchical porosity to CPOSs leads to new properties and a new upsurge in research.

      <title>Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting</title>
      <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free electrochemical cycling of potassium metal anodes is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting on a geometrically rough all&#8208;aluminum current collector. The electrolyte was standard potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane and no modifications were made to the collector surface chemistry. The key takeaway from this study is that good electrolyte wetting is necessary for stable plating/stripping, with poor wetting ensuring instability and dendrite growth.








Abstract
This is the first report of successful potassium metal battery anode cycling with an aluminum&#8208;based rather than copper&#8208;based current collector. Dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting, employing an aluminum&#8208;powder&#8208;coated aluminum foil &#8220;Al@Al,&#8221; without any modification of the support surface chemistry or electrolyte additives. The reservoir&#8208;free Al@Al half&#8208;cell is stable at 1000 cycles (1950&#160;h) at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 98.9% cycling Coulombic efficiency and 0.085&#160;V overpotential. The pre&#8208;potassiated cell is stable through a wide current range, including 130&#160;cycles (2600 min) at 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 0.178&#160;V overpotential. Al@Al is fully wetted by a 4 m potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte (&#952;CA&#160;= 0&#176;), producing a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial galvanostatic formation cycles. On planar aluminum foil with a nearly identical surface oxide, the electrolyte wets poorly (&#952;CA&#160;= 52&#176;). This correlates with coarse irregular SEI clumps at formation, 3D potassium islands with further SEI coarsening during plating/stripping, possibly dead potassium metal on stripped surfaces, and rapid failure. The electrochemical stability of Al@Al versus planar Al is not related to differences in potassiophilicity (nearly identical) as obtained from thermal wetting experiments. Planar Cu foils are also poorly electrolyte&#8208;wetted and become dendritic. The key fundamental takeaway is that the incomplete electrolyte wetting of collectors results in early onset of SEI instability and dendrites.

      <title>Lattice&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Enhanced Yield Strength in a Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
      <dc:description>
The lattice distortions of the NbTaTiV and NbTaTiVZr refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are quantitatively calculated and measured by various techniques. The relationship between the lattice distortion and yield strength is clearly demonstrated by the addition of Zr elements in an NbTaTiV HEA, resulting in an enhanced yield strength due to the increased lattice distortion.








Abstract
Severe distortion is one of the four core effects in single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and contributes significantly to the yield strength. However, the connection between the atomic&#8208;scale lattice distortion and macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties through experimental verification has yet to be fully achieved, owing to two critical challenges: 1) the difficulty in the development of homogeneous single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution HEAs and 2) the ambiguity in describing the lattice distortion and related measurements and calculations. A single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) refractory HEA, NbTaTiVZr, using thermodynamic modeling coupled with experimental verifications, is developed. Compared to the previously developed single&#8208;phase NbTaTiV HEA, the NbTaTiVZr HEA shows a higher yield strength and comparable plasticity. The increase in yield strength is systematically and quantitatively studied in terms of lattice distortion using a theoretical model, first&#8208;principles calculations, synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, atom&#8208;probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. These results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a core factor for developing high strengths in refractory HEAs.

      <dc:description>
Freestanding BaTiO3 membranes (ferroelastic oxides) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (organism) are combined to construct a periodically wrinkled structure. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore strain&#8208;correlated fundamental phenomena such as flexoelectricity, strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric domain evolutions, and phase transitions, as well as the periodic electric potential induced functions in flexible optical and electrical devices.

Self&#8208;assembled membranes with periodic wrinkled patterns are the critical building blocks of various flexible electronics, where the wrinkles are usually designed and fabricated to provide distinct functionalities. These membranes are typically metallic and organic materials with good ductility that are tolerant of complex deformation. However, the preparation of oxide membranes, especially those with intricate wrinkle patterns, is challenging due to their inherently strong covalent or ionic bonding, which usually leads to material crazing and brittle fracture. Here, wrinkle&#8208;patterned BaTiO3 (BTO)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes with finely controlled parallel, zigzag, and mosaic patterns are prepared. The BTO layers show excellent flexibility and can form well&#8208;ordered and periodic wrinkles under compressive in&#8208;plane stress. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites of peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. Atomistic simulations further reveal that the excellent elasticity and the correlated coupling between polarization and strain/strain gradient are strongly associated with ferroelectric domain switching and continuous dipole rotation. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is primarily generated at compressive regions, while the in&#8208;plane polarization dominates at the tensile regions. The wrinkled ferroelectric oxides with differently strained regions and correlated polarization distributions would pave a way toward novel flexible electronics.

      <title>Discovering Electron&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Changes in Chemical Bonding in Lead Chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O)</title>
      <dc:description>
Systematic changes of chemical bonding are studied in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O) to comprehend their properties. The exploration reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X&#160;=&#160;Te,&#160;Se,&#160;S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. The insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.








Abstract
Understanding the nature of chemical bonding in solids is crucial to comprehend the physical and chemical properties of a given compound. To explore changes in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O), a combination of property&#8208;, bond&#8208;breaking&#8208;, and quantum&#8208;mechanical bonding descriptors are applied. The outcome of the explorations reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by adjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron (ES &#8776; 1) and small electron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono&#8208;covalent bonding manifests itself in clear changes in these quantum&#8208;mechanical descriptors (ES and ET), as well as in property&#8208;based descriptors (i.e., Born effective charge (Z*), dielectric function &#949;(&#969;), effective coordination number (ECoN), and mode&#8208;specific Gr&#252;neisen parameter (&#947;TO)), and in bond&#8208;breaking descriptors. Metavalent bonding collapses if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores (ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor material properties such as the chemical bond (Z*) and electronic (&#949;&#8734;) polarizability, optical bandgap, and optical interband transitions characterized by &#949;2(&#969;). Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.

      <title>Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants</title>
      <dc:description>
An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of a devised doping strategy with conjugated polymers (CPs) which contains electron&#8208;donating S and N atoms together in its conjugated skeleton. The cascade doping approach is expected to be readily applicable to many useful CP developments for outperforming organic conductors.








Abstract
Doping capability is primitively governed by the energy level offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of conjugated polymers (CPs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of dopants. A poor doping efficiency is obtained when doping directly using NOBF4 forming a large energy offset with the CP, while the devised doping strategy is found to significantly improve the doping efficiency (electrical conductivity) by sequentially treating the NOBF4 to the pre&#8208;doped CP with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquino&#8208;dimethane (F4TCNQ), establishing a relatively small energy level offset. It is verified that the cascade doping strategy requires receptive sites for each dopant to further improve the doping efficiency, and provides fast reaction kinetics energetically. An outstanding electrical conductivity (&gt;610 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved through the optimization of the devised doping strategy, and spectroscopy analysis, including Hall effect measurement, supports more efficient charge carrier generation via the devised cascade doping.

      <title>Low&#8208;Cost Titanium&#8211;Bromine Flow Battery with Ultrahigh Cycle Stability for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
A long&#8208;cycle and low&#8208;cost titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery is achieved with the help of a novel bromine complexing agent (CHA) and a porous polyolefin membrane. CHA can not only capture the polybromides with a large size excluded by a membrane but also can keep the positive electrolyte in the nearly homogeneous phase, which endows the battery with outstanding stability.








Abstract
Flow batteries are one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the currently used flow batteries have low operation&#8211;cost&#8208;effectiveness and exhibit low energy density, which limits their commercialization. Herein, a titanium&#8211;bromine flow battery (TBFB) featuring very low operation cost and outstanding stability is reported. In this battery, a novel complexing agent, 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, is employed to stabilize bromine/polybromides and suppress Br diffusion. The results reveal that the complexing agent effectively inhibits Br crossover and reduces Br&#8208;induced corrosivity, which in turn significantly improves the reliability of the TBFB system. The novel TBFB demonstrates 95% coulombic efficiency and 83% energy efficiency at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density. Moreover, it can run smoothly for more than 1000 cycles without any capacity decay. Furthermore, an assembled 300 W TBFB stack can be continuously operated for more than 500 cycles, thereby confirming the practical applicability of the proposed TBFB. Because the TBFB utilizes an ultralow&#8208;cost electrolyte (41.29&#160;$&#160;kWh&#8722;1) and porous polyolefin membranes, it serves as a reliable and low&#8208;cost energy&#8208;storage device. Therefore, considering its ultrahigh stability and low cost, the TBFB can be used as a large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage device.

      <title>Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The main aspects of the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are summarized, clarifying the challenges and opportunities for researchers. As the EMSI directly affects the electronic state of the catalysts, the deep principles underlying the reaction are considered, which is important for determining the generality among all electrocatalytic reactions and understanding the fundamental laws that SACs obey in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which acts as a bridge between theoretical electronic study and the design of heterogenous catalysts, has attracted much attention. Utilizing the interaction between the metal and the support is one of the most essential strategies to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency due to structural and synergetic promotion. To date, as the ideal model for realizing EMSI, many types of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been developed. The understanding of the electronic interaction on SACs has also been pushed to a higher level. However, systematic theories and operando experiments are seldom reported, and will be necessary to put forward and be carried out, respectively. Herein, the types, characterization, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of EMSI are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of the EMSI on SACs are also proposed to present an overall view and reference to the later research.

      <title>Dislocation&#8208;Strained IrNi Alloy Nanoparticles Driven by Thermal Shock for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles with competitive HER activity are realized by unsteady thermal shock progress in an extreme environment, and they are uniformly distributed within a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS). Numerous dislocations are generated in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to ultrafast quenching, inducing strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles, which optimize the electronic structure of the active sites.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is crucial for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles loaded on a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS) driven by unsteady thermal shock in an extreme environment are reported here as a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that numerous dislocations are kinetically trapped in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to the ultrafast quenching and different atomic radii, which can induce strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles. Such strain&#8208;induced high&#8208;energy surface structures arising from bulk defects (dislocations), are more likely to be resistant to surface restructuring during catalysis. The catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity with only 17 mV overpotential to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline electrolyte with fabulous stability, exceeding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts.&#160;These&#160;density functional theory results demonstrate that the electronic structure of as&#8208;synthesized IrNi nanostructure can be optimized by the strain effects induced by the dislocations, and the free energy of HER can be tuned toward the optimal region.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Unidirectional Manipulation of Microdroplets by Horizontal Vibration on Femtosecond Laser&#8208;Induced Slant Microwall Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets, such as multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90&#176; turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range and high&#8208;speed transport, by horizontal vibration is achieved on a polymeric substrate with slant microgroove arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser oblique ablation technology, demonstrating great potential in the field of liquid microreactions.








Abstract
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets is crucial for many vital applications including water collection and bioanalysis. Among several actuation methods (e.g., electric, magnetic, light, and thermal actuation), mechanical vibration is pollution&#8208;free and biocompatible. However, it suffers from limited droplet movement mode, small volume range (VMax/VMin&#160;&lt;&#160;3), and low transport velocity (&#8804;11.5&#160;mm s&#8722;1) because the droplet motion is a sliding state caused by the vertical vibration on the asymmetric hydrophobic microstructures. Here, an alternative strategy is proposed&#8212;horizontal vibration for multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90o turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range (VMax/VMin&#160;&#8776; 100), and high&#8208;speed (&#8776;22.86&#160;mm s&#8722;1) unidirectional microdroplet manipulation, which is ascribed to the rolling state on superhydrophobic slant microwall arrays (SMWAs) fabricated by the one&#8208;step femtosecond laser oblique ablation. The unidirectional transport mechanism relies on the variance of viscous resistance induced by the difference of contact area between the microdroplet and the slant microwalls. Furthermore, a circular, curved, and &#8220;L&#8221;&#8208;shaped SMWA is designed and fabricated for droplet motion with particular paths. Finally, sequential transport of large&#8208;volume&#8208;range droplets and chemical mixing microreaction of water&#8208;based droplets are demonstrated on the SMWA, which demonstrates the great potential in the field of microdroplet manipulation.

      <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ion&#8208;Responsive Antimicrobial Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) can be achieved in a porphyrin&#8208;based anionic HOF structure, endowing the material with synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficacy. By further taking advantage of the unbonded carboxyl groups on the HOF particle surface, a freestanding flexible membrane that shows high permeability, good stability, and excellent antibacterial activity is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for specific applications has been a long&#8208;lasting challenge in HOF materials. Here, an efficient way to integrate functional species in the HOF structure through constructing an anionic framework is presented. The obtained HOFs, taking PFC&#8208;33 (PFC = porous materials from FJIRSM,CAS) as an example, integrate a porphyrin photosensitizer as a porous backbone and a commercial biocide as counterions in the structure. The permanent channels and the electrostatic interaction between the framework and the counterions provide PFC&#8208;33 ion&#8208;responsive biocide&#8208;release behavior in various physiological environments, thus exhibiting synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficiency. The unbonded carboxyl groups residing on the HOF surface further allow for manipulating the interfacial interaction between the PFC&#8208;33 and the polymer matrix for membrane fabrication. Therefore, a polyHOF membrane with high stability, desired flexibility, and good permeability is obtained, which demonstrates noticeable bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the functionalization of HOF materials for broad application potentials.

      <title>Isotope Effect in the Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Response of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Donor&#8211;Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence of donor&#8211;acceptor blends, both the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence response and electron magnetic resonance spectrum are found to be independent of the particular hydrogen isotope (protium or deuterium) present. This shows that the reverse intersystem crossing process from the triplet to singlet states occurs in the exciplex manifold rather than that of the polaron pair.








Abstract
The isotope effect is studied in the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence (MEL) and pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from donor&#8211;acceptor exciplexes that are either protonated (H) or deuterated (D). It is found that at ambient temperature, the exchange of H to D has no effect on the spin&#8208;dependent current and MEL responses in the devices. However, at cryogenic temperatures, where the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet exciplex diminishes, a pronounced isotope effect is observed. These results show that the RISC process is not governed by the hyperfine interaction as thought previously, but proceeds through spin&#8208;mixing in the triplet exciplex. The observations are corroborated by electrically detected transient spin nutation experiments that show relatively long dephasing time at ambient temperature, and interpreted in the context of a model that involves exchange and hyperfine interactions in the spin triplet exciplex. These findings deepen the understanding of the RISC process in TADF materials.

      <title>Promoted Photocharge Separation in 2D Lateral Epitaxial Heterostructure for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Photoreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
2D lateral heterostructure is in situ fabricated. Benefiting from the strong chemical bonding at the heterointerface, strong internal electric field is generated between two components of the heterostructure, which facilitates photoexcited charge separation and transfer kinetics, and results in improved solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Photocarrier recombination remains a big barrier for the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. For 2D materials, construction of heterostructures represents an efficient strategy to promote photoexcited carrier separation via an internal electric field at the heterointerface. However, due to the difficulty in seeking two components with suitable crystal lattice mismatch, most of the current 2D heterostructures are vertical heterostructures and the exploration of 2D lateral heterostructures is scarce and limited. Here, lateral epitaxial heterostructures of BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 at the atomic level are fabricated via sonicating&#8208;assisted etching of Cl in BiOCl. This unique lateral heterostructure expedites photoexcited charge separation and transportation through the internal electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral interface. As a result, the lateral BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 heterostructure demonstrates superior CO2 photoreduction properties with a CO yield rate of about 30&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination. The strategy to fabricate lateral epitaxial heterostructures in this work is expected to provide inspiration for preparing other 2D lateral heterostructures used in optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.

      <title>Microfabricated Ion&#8208;Selective Transistors with Fast and Super&#8208;Nernstian Response</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfabricated ion&#8208;selective transistors with fast response and super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity are demonstrated. The remarkable performance arises from the use of a thin polyelectrolyte film as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the organic electrochemical transistor. The sensor architecture is generic and applicable to sensing of various ions, opening new frontiers for wearable and implantable ion sensors.








Abstract
Transistor&#8208;based ion sensors have evolved significantly, but the best&#8208;performing ones rely on a liquid electrolyte as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the channel. This liquid reservoir makes sensor miniaturization difficult and leads to devices that are bulky and have limited mechanical flexibility, which is holding back the development of high&#8208;performance wearable/implantable ion sensors. This work demonstrates microfabricated ion&#8208;selective organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a transconductance of 4&#160;mS, in which a thin polyelectrolyte film with mobile sodium ions replaces the liquid reservoir. These devices are capable of selective detection of various ions with a fast response time (&#8776;1&#160;s), a super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity (85&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and a high current sensitivity (224&#160;&#181;A&#160;dec&#8722;1), comparing favorably to other ion sensors based on traditional and emerging materials. Furthermore, the ion&#8208;selective OECTs are stable with highly reproducible sensitivity even after 5 months. These characteristics pave the way for new applications in implantable and wearable electronics.

      <title>Highly Ordered 2D&#8208;Assemblies of Phase&#8208;Segregated Block Molecules for Upconverted Linearly Polarized Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;energy&#8208;migration&#8208;based photon upconversion is demonstrated in films of 2D crystalline sheets of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene functionalized with discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane. Annealing increases the upconverted photoluminescence intensity up to 100&#8208;fold due to increased chromophore ordering and enhanced donor dispersion. Upconversion imaging microscopy spatially resolves the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion intensity with micrometer resolution. Millimeter&#8208;sized domains show linearly polarized upconverted emission.








Abstract
Materials based on the laminar ordering of self&#8208;assembled molecules have a unique potential for applications requiring efficient energy migration through densely packed chromophores. Here, employing molecular assemblies of coil&#8211;rod&#8211;coil block molecules for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet energy migration with linearly polarized emission is reported. By covalently attaching discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) to 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), highly ordered 2D crystalline DPA sheets separated by oDMS layers are obtained. Transparent films of this material doped with small amounts of triplet sensitizer PtII octaethylporphyrin show air&#8208;stable TTA&#8208;UC under non&#8208;coherent excitation. Upon annealing, an increase in TTA&#8208;UC up to two orders of magnitude is observed originating from both an improved molecular ordering of DPA and an increased dispersion of the sensitizer. The molecular alignment in millimeter&#8208;sized domains leads to upconverted linearly polarized emission without alignment layers. By using a novel technique, upconversion imaging microscopy, the TTA&#8208;UC intensity is spatially resolved on a micrometer scale to visually demonstrate the importance of molecular dispersion of sensitizer molecules for efficient TTA&#8208;UC. The reported results are promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and 3D night&#8208;vision applications, but also exemplify the potential of discrete oligodimethylsiloxane functionalized chromophores for highly aligned and densely packed molecular materials.

      <title>Precisely Controlling the Position of Bromine on the End Group Enables Well&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 15%</title>
      <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;regular polymer acceptors (PY&#8208;IT and PY&#8208;OT) with different polymerization sites are developed. For comparison, a random ternary copolymer (PY&#8208;IOT) with the same ratio of the two acceptors is synthesized. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT achieve an excellent PCE of 15.05%, which is significantly higher than those based on PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%).








Abstract
Recent advances in the development of polymerized A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) have promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) over 13%. However, the monomer of an SMA typically consists of a mixture of three isomers due to the regio&#8208;isomeric brominated end groups (IC&#8208;Br(in) and IC&#8208;Br(out)). In this work, the two isomeric end groups are successfully separated, the regioisomeric issue is solved, and three polymer acceptors, named PY&#8208;IT, PY&#8208;OT, and PY&#8208;IOT, are developed, where PY&#8208;IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. Interestingly, from PY&#8208;OT, PY&#8208;IOT to PY&#8208;IT, the absorption edge gradually redshifts and electron mobility progressively increases. Theory calculation indicates that the LUMOs are distributed on the entire molecular backbone of PY&#8208;IT, contributing to the enhanced electron transport. Consequently, the PM6:PY&#8208;IT system achieves an excellent PCE of 15.05%, significantly higher than those for PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%). Morphological and device characterization reveals that the highest PCE for the PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based device is the fruit of enhanced absorption, more balanced charge transport, and favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that the site of polymerization on SMAs strongly affects device performance, offering insights into the development of efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.

However, the monomer of an SMA typically consists of a mixture of three isomers due to the regio&#8208;isomeric brominated end groups (IC&#8208;Br(in) and IC&#8208;Br(out)). In this work, the two isomeric end groups are successfully separated, the regioisomeric issue is solved, and three polymer acceptors, named PY&#8208;IT, PY&#8208;OT, and PY&#8208;IOT, are developed, where PY&#8208;IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. Interestingly, from PY&#8208;OT, PY&#8208;IOT to PY&#8208;IT, the absorption edge gradually redshifts and electron mobility progressively increases. Theory calculation indicates that the LUMOs are distributed on the entire molecular backbone of PY&#8208;IT, contributing to the enhanced electron transport. Consequently, the PM6:PY&#8208;IT system achieves an excellent PCE of 15.05%, significantly higher than those for PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%). Morphological and device characterization reveals that the highest PCE for the PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based device is the fruit of enhanced absorption, more balanced charge transport, and favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that the site of polymerization on SMAs strongly affects device performance, offering insights into the development of efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via an Unconjugated Donor&#8211;Acceptor System Realizing EQE of Over 30%</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2tDMG, is designed and synthesized based on the donor (D)/acceptor (A) spatially intramolecular noncovalent interaction. The D/A units are connected via a rigid linker, thereby confining them into a close&#8208;packed coplanar configuration for small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy. 2tDMG achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 30.8% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off in evaporation&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
In this work, two novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, 2tDMG and 3tDMG, are synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), The two emitters have a tilted face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment of donor (D)/acceptor (A) units presenting intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The two TADF materials are deposited either by an evaporation&#8208;process or by a solution&#8208;process, both of them leading to high OLED performance. 2tDMG used as the emitter in evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.8% with a very flat efficiency roll&#8208;off of 7% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The solution&#8208;processed OLEDs also display an interesting EQE of 16.2%. 3tDMG shows improved solubility and solution processability as compared to 2tDMG, and thus a high EQE of 20.2% in solution&#8208;processed OLEDs is recorded. The corresponding evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs also reach a reasonably high EQE of 26.3%. Encouragingly, this work provides a novel strategy to address the imperious demands for OLEDs with high EQE and low roll&#8208;off.

      <title>Controllable Magnetic Proximity Effect and Charge Transfer in 2D Semiconductor and Double&#8208;Layered Perovskite Manganese Oxide van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel van der Waals heterostructure consisting of monolayer MoSe2, Mn oxide, and a buffer layer (h&#8208;BN) demonstrates magnetic proximity and charge transfer effect for the excitonic states due to phase transition of Mn oxide from ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator. The controllable thickness of h&#8208;BN reveals the characteristic length scale of several nanometers in magnetic proximity and charge transfer.








Abstract
Optically generated excitonic states (excitons and trions) in transition metal dichalcogenides are highly sensitive to the electronic and magnetic properties of the materials underneath. Modulation and control of the excitonic states in a novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 on double&#8208;layered perovskite Mn oxide ((La0.8Nd0.2)1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7) is demonstrated, wherein the Mn oxide transforms from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal. A discontinuous change in the exciton photoluminescence intensity via dielectric screening is observed. Further, a relatively high trion intensity is discovered due to the charge transfer from metallic Mn oxide under the Curie temperature. Moreover, the vdW heterostructures with an ultrathin h&#8208;BN spacer layer demonstrate enhanced valley splitting and polarization of excitonic states due to the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic spins of Mn oxide. The controllable h&#8208;BN thickness in vdW heterostructures reveals a several&#8208;nanometer&#8208;long scale of charge transfer as well as a magnetic proximity effect. The vdW heterostructure allows modulation and control of the excitonic states via dielectric screening, charge carriers, and magnetic spins.

      <title>Dirac Fermion Kinetics in 3D Curved Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
3D curved graphene with a wide range of curvature radii from 25 to 1000 nm demonstrates that nanoscale curvature is a new degree of freedom to tune the transport properties of graphene by manipulating 2D electron kinetics on 3D curved surfaces.








Abstract
3D integration of&#160;graphene has attracted attention for realizing&#160;carbon&#8208;based electronic devices. While the 3D integration can amplify various excellent properties of graphene, the influence of 3D curved surfaces on the fundamental physical properties of graphene has not been clarified. The electronic properties of 3D nanoporous graphene with a curvature radius down to 25&#8211;50 nm are systematically investigated and the ambipolar electronic states of Dirac fermions are essentially preserved in the 3D graphene nanoarchitectures, while the 3D curvature can effectively suppress the slope of the linear density of states of Dirac fermion near the Fermi level are demonstrated. Importantly, the 3D curvature can be utilized to tune the back&#8208;scattering&#8208;suppressed electrical transport of Dirac fermions and enhance&#160;both electron localization and electron&#8211;electron interaction. As a result, nanoscale curvature&#160;provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate&#160;3D graphene electrical properties, which may pave a new way to design new 3D graphene devices with preserved 2D electronic properties&#160;and novel functionalities.

Abstract
The need for optoelectronic and chemical compatibility between the layers in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaic devices remains a bottleneck in further increasing performance. Conjugated polymers are promising candidates as new hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) materials in CQD solar cells (CQD&#8208;SCs) owing to the highly tunable optoelectronic properties and compatible chemistries. A diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer with benzothiadiazole derivatives (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) as an HTL in these devices is reported. The energy level, molecular orientation, and hole mobility of this HTL are manipulated through molecular engineering. By levering the polymer's optical absorption spectrum complementary to that of the CQD active layer, EQE across the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions is maximized. As a result, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device exhibits a fill factor of 70% and approximately 35% efficiency enhancement compared to a PTB7&#8208;based device.

      <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Functionalized Sonodynamic Treatment for Improving Therapeutic Efficacy and Compliance of Orthotopic Oral Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is developed for the treatment of oral cancer with good compliance. An ultrasound&#8208;responsive mesenchymal stem cells membrane functionalized liposome is designed for co&#8208;delivery of sonosensitizer and oxygen, which not only increases tumor targeting and penetration but also supplies oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, resulting in prolonged survival and maintenance of oral functions.








Abstract
Despite multiple treatment options being available, many critical challenges are still ongoing in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Particularly, the major hurdle is to avoid facial disfigurement and oral function disability during treatment. Herein, nanoengineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are developed as a supersonosensitizer, named M/LPV/O2, for improving nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) against OSCC along with good therapeutic compliance. M/LPV/O2 is composed of an MSCs membrane functionalized liposomal formulation of oxygen&#8208;loading perfluorocarbon and sonosensitizer verteporfin (M/LPV/O2), which can not only increase circulation and targeting efficacy but also supply oxygen to overcome tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;associated resistance in SDT, resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. It is identified that M/LPV/O2 effectively stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species even in hypoxic conditions, and consequently tremendously induces cancer cell death. In addition, M/LPV/O2 displays good tumor accumulation and penetration under ultrasound stimulation, and efficiently induces tumor inhibition and even abrogation, leading to prolonged survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Importantly, M/LPV/O2&#8208;based SDT exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects and successfully maintains oral functions with no facial tissue damage. Therefore, these studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, which has a potential to enhance life quality and compliance after treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is developed for the treatment of oral cancer with good compliance. An ultrasound&#8208;responsive mesenchymal stem cells membrane functionalized liposome is designed for co&#8208;delivery of sonosensitizer and oxygen, which not only increases tumor targeting and penetration but also supplies oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, resulting in prolonged survival and maintenance of oral functions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple treatment options being available, many critical challenges are still ongoing in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Particularly, the major hurdle is to avoid facial disfigurement and oral function disability during treatment. Herein, nanoengineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are developed as a supersonosensitizer, named M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for improving nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) against OSCC along with good therapeutic compliance. M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is composed of an MSCs membrane functionalized liposomal formulation of oxygen&#8208;loading perfluorocarbon and sonosensitizer verteporfin (M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which can not only increase circulation and targeting efficacy but also supply oxygen to overcome tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;associated resistance in SDT, resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. It is identified that M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species even in hypoxic conditions, and consequently tremendously induces cancer cell death. In addition, M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays good tumor accumulation and penetration under ultrasound stimulation, and efficiently induces tumor inhibition and even abrogation, leading to prolonged survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Importantly, M/LPV/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based SDT exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects and successfully maintains oral functions with no facial tissue damage. Therefore, these studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, which has a potential to enhance life quality and compliance after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Adhesive Molybdenum Disulfide/rGO Vertical Heterostructures with Enhanced Nanozyme Activity for Smart Bacterial Killing Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide/rGO vertical heterostructures are demonstrated to possess triple enzyme&#8208;like activities, which are further enhanced through light irradiation. Coupled with the rough surface that contributes excellent capacity for bacterial capture, preeminent antibacterial efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria is exhibited both in vitro and in vivo by such a defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozyme, which will blaze a new path for the development of alternative antibiotics.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activities, namely &#8220;nanozymes,&#8221; are showing increasing potential as a new type of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their feasibility is still far from satisfactory, due to their low catalytic activity, poor bacterial capturing capacity, and complicated material design. Herein, a facile synthesis of a defect&#8208;rich adhesive molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/rGO vertical heterostructure (VHS) through a one&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method is reported. This simple, convenient but effective method for rapid material synthesis enables extremely uniform and well&#8208;dispersed MoS2/rGO VHS with abundant S and Mo vacancies and rough surface, for a performance approaching the requirements of practical application. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the as&#8208;prepared MoS2/rGO VHS possesses defect and irradiation dual&#8208;enhanced triple enzyme&#8208;like activities (oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase) for promoting free&#8208;radical generation, owing to much more active edge sites exposure. Meanwhile, the VHS&#8208;achieved rough surface exhibits excellent capacity for bacterial capture, with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) destruction through local topological interactions. As a result, optimized efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria can be explored by such defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozymes, demonstrating a simple but powerful way to engineered nanozymes for alternative antibiotics.

      <title>Realization of Regular&#8208;Mixed Quasi&#8208;1D Borophene Chains with Long&#8208;Range Order</title>
      <dc:description>
New structural phases of borophene grown by molecular beam epitaxy are observed on a Ag(100) substrate. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and ab initio calculations are consistent in the discovery of mixed phases, which can be described as a combination of quasi&#8208;1D borophene chains and can be separated by substrate orientation.








Abstract
The polymorphism of borophene makes it a promising system to realize tunable physical or chemical properties. Various pure borophene phases consisting of quasi&#8208;1D boron chains with different widths have been commonly obtained in experimental studies. Here, it is shown that, due to a substrate mediation effect, artificial long&#8208;range ordered phases of borophene consisting of different combinations of boron chains seamlessly joined together can be achieved on Ag(100). Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that mixed&#8208;chain phases are more stable than the pure phase, and interact only weakly with the substrate. The mixed&#8208;chain phases with various proportions of different chains can be well separated based on the crystal direction of the substrate. The successful growth of mixed&#8208;chain phases is expected to deepen the impact of substrate tailored synthesis of borophene.

      <title>Reversible Deposition of Lithium Particles Enabled by Ultraconformal and Stretchable Graphene Film for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Stacked graphene layers are built in situ on Li metal as an ultraconformal and deformable protective skin. This skin inhibits direct contact between the Li metal and the electrolyte while enabling fast Li&#8208;ion transfer for Li deposition beneath. Interlayer slip and wrinkles ensure the graphene film is ultraconformal during reversible expansion and shrinkage of the micro&#8208;sized Li particles, which suppresses Li dendrites and pulverization.








Abstract
Originating from inhomogeneous Li deposition and dissolution, the formation of dendritic and/or dead Li lies as a fundamental barrier to the practical implementation of Li metal anodes for high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, an ultraconformal and stretchable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of parallelly stacked few&#8208;layer defect&#8208;free graphene nanosheets, which can deform to remain ultraconformal during the expansion and shrinkage of micro&#8208;sized Li metal particles is reported. The shape&#8208;adaptive graphene protective skin is prepared via a facile mechanical method followed by Li stripping, which enables fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and inhibits Li dendrites and Li pulverization. The interlayer slips and wrinkles of the graphene film endow the robust protective skin with high stretchability. This work represents a unique strategy of building ultraconformal and stretchable 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based protective skins on the surface of Li metal toward high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life, and safe Li metal batteries.

      <title>Negative&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Induced Large Polarization in Nanosized PbTiO3</title>
      <dc:description>
0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized through a two&#8208;phase solvethermal method. Raised tetragonality, as well as enhanced spontaneous polarization are achieved, induced by a negative pressure along the c axis. This originates from strengthened Pb&#8211;O hybridization induced by plentiful distribution of PbO terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs, which has been theoretically identified as a crucial factor of ferroelectricity.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials usually undergo decay with particle size decreasing into the nanoscale. At the critical value, the crystal structure undergoes a transition from the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase and the ferroelectricity vanishes. It is a big issue to sufficiently maintain strong ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. Herein, it is reported that synthesized 0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) present negative pressure along the c axis (&#916;c/cbulk &#215; 100% =&#160;&#8722;2.406), inducing large spontaneous polarization PS (71.2 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 in 12&#160;nm). Further local structural studies by atomic pair distribution functions and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure indicate the structural evolution of nanosized PbTiO3. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field STEM images reveal the existence of preponderant PbO&#8208;terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs. Ab initio calculation reveals the enhanced hybridization between Pb and O ions, which gives rise to the negative pressure and tensile stress to stabilize the high tetragonality and large polarization. The present work demonstrates an untraditional route to enhance the ferroelectricity and related properties in functional nanostructured materials, being of significance to nanodevices.

      <title>Spontaneous (Anti)meron Chains in the Domain Walls of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
The generation of (anti)meron chains from conventional domain walls is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, which closely correlates with the weak van der Waals interaction and temperature&#8208;dependent spin anisotropy transformation. The simultaneous topological Hall effect and the collectively dynamic behavior of the (anti)meron chains under external fields experimentally highlight the theoretical prediction of magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology.








Abstract
The promise of topologically vortex&#8208;like magnetic spin textures hinges on the intriguing physical properties and theories in fundamental research and their distinguished roles as high&#8208;efficiency information units in future spintronics. The exploration of such magnetic states with unique spin configurations has never ceased. In this study, the emergence of unconventional (anti)meron chains from a domain wall pair is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, closely correlated with significant enhancement of the in&#8208;plane magnetization and weak van der Waals interactions. The simultaneous appearance of a large topological Hall effect is observed at the same temperature range as that of the abnormal magnetic transition. Moreover, the distinctive features of the (anti)meron chains and their collective dynamic behavior under external fields may provide concrete experimental evidence for the recent theoretical prediction of the magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology and endorse a broader range of possibilities for electronics, spintronics, condensed matter physics, etc.

&lt;p&gt;The promise of topologically vortex&#8208;like magnetic spin textures hinges on the intriguing physical properties and theories in fundamental research and their distinguished roles as high&#8208;efficiency information units in future spintronics. The exploration of such magnetic states with unique spin configurations has never ceased. In this study, the emergence of unconventional (anti)meron chains from a domain wall pair is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, closely correlated with significant enhancement of the in&#8208;plane magnetization and weak van der Waals interactions. The simultaneous appearance of a large topological Hall effect is observed at the same temperature range as that of the abnormal magnetic transition. Moreover, the distinctive features of the (anti)meron chains and their collective dynamic behavior under external fields may provide concrete experimental evidence for the recent theoretical prediction of the magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology and endorse a broader range of possibilities for electronics, spintronics, condensed matter physics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD Neutralizing Antibody Induction is Enhanced by Particulate Vaccination</title>
      <dc:description>
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a target for COVID&#8208;19 vaccine development. Using a next&#8208;generation vaccine adjuvant system that rapidly converts soluble antigens into stable particles, the neutralizing antibody response induced by the RBD is greatly enhanced, demonstrating merit for particle&#8208;based approaches toward RBD&#8208;based vaccines.








Abstract
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is a candidate vaccine antigen that binds angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2&#160;(ACE2), leading to virus entry. Here, it is shown that rapid conversion of recombinant RBD into particulate form via admixing with liposomes containing cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;phospholipid (CoPoP) potently enhances the functional antibody response. Antigen binding via His&#8208;tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum&#8208;stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen&#8208;presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes. QS&#8208;21 inclusion in the liposomes results in an enhanced antigen&#8208;specific polyfunctional T cell response. In mice, high dose immunization results in minimal local reactogenicity, is well&#8208;tolerated, and does not elevate serum cobalt levels. Taken together, these results confirm that particulate presentation strategies for the RBD immunogen should be considered for inducing strongly neutralizing antibody responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

      <title>An Adaptable Cryptosystem Enabled by Synergies of Luminogens with Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Character</title>
      <dc:description>
An adaptable optical cryptosystem is established based on the synergies among three interconnected and orthogonal covalent reactions concerning aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens. The four variants adapted by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways allow the balance between accessibility and security, variable decryption from individual encryption, and reconstruction of hidden chemical information through given algorithms.








Abstract
The strong emission in the solid state and the feasibility of introducing stimuli responsiveness make aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens promising for optical information encryption. Yet, the vast majority of previous reports rely on subtle changes in the molecular conformation or intermolecular interactions, limiting the robustness, multiplicity, capacity, and security of the resulting cryptosystems. Herein, a versatile cryptographic system is presented based on three interconnected and orthogonal covalent transformations concerning a tetraphenylethylene&#8211;maleimide conjugate. The cryptosystem is adapted into four configurations with different functionalities by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways. These variants either balance the accessibility and security of the encrypted information or improve the security and density in data encryption. Significantly, they allow variable decryption from a single encryption and reconstruction of the chemical nature hidden in the fluorescent pattern can only be accessed through given algorithms. These results highlight the importance of multi&#8208;component synergies in advancing information encryption systems, which is enabled by the robustness and diversity stemming from the covalent nature of these transformations.

      <title>Combinatorial Strategy for Studying Biochemical Pathways in Double Emulsion Templated Cell&#8208;Sized Compartments</title>
      <dc:description>
The novel combinatorial strategy for studying enzymatic cascade reactions inside synthetic compartments, produced via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics can be applied to any multi&#8208;step cascades, and enables discovering unwanted pathways, detecting undesirable intermediates, and identifying routes for rapid toxins consumption. Such appealing aspects will enhance capabilities of biotechnological applications as enzyme replacement therapy, biological detoxification, chemical synthesis, and biosensors.








Abstract
Cells rely upon producing enzymes at precise rates and stoichiometry for maximizing functionalities. The reasons for this optimal control are unknown, primarily because of the interconnectivity of the enzymatic cascade effects within multi&#8208;step pathways. Here, an elegant strategy for studying such behavior, by controlling segregation/combination of enzymes/metabolites in synthetic cell&#8208;sized compartments, while preserving vital cellular elements is presented. Therefore, compartments shaped into polymer GUVs are developed, producing via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics that enable: i) tight control over the absolute and relative enzymatic contents inside the GUVs, reaching nearly 100% encapsulation and co&#8208;encapsulation efficiencies, and ii) functional reconstitution of biopores and membrane proteins in the GUVs polymeric membrane, thus supporting in situ reactions. GUVs equipped with biopores/membrane proteins and loaded with one or more enzymes are arranged in a variety of combinations that allow the study of a three&#8208;step cascade in multiple topologies. Due to the spatiotemporal control provided, optimum conditions for decreasing the accumulation of inhibitors are unveiled, and benefited from reactive intermediates to maximize the overall cascade efficiency in compartments. The non&#8208;system&#8208;specific feature of the novel strategy makes this system an ideal candidate for the development of new synthetic routes as well as for screening natural and more complex pathways.

      <title>Organ&#8208;Level Functional 3D Tissue Constructs with Complex Compartments and their Preclinical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Advanced 3D tissue models in terms of higher scale and complexity are reviewed. Organ&#8208;level 3D tissue constructs can mimic physiological/pathological features with highly networked structures of vascular/neural compartments. The novel outcomes of these models are highlighted as preclinical applications and the current limitations and future directions of this area are also discussed.








Abstract
There is an increasing interest in organ&#8208;level 3D tissue constructs, owing to their mirroring of in vivo&#8208;like features. This has resulted in a wide range of preclinical applications to obtain cell&#8208; or tissue&#8208;specific responses. Additionally, the development and improvement of sophisticated technologies, such as organoid generation, microfluidics, hydrogel engineering, and 3D printing, have enhanced 3D tissue constructs to become more elaborate. In particular, recent studies have focused on including complex compartments, i.e., vascular and innervation structured 3D tissue constructs, which mimic the nature of the human body in that all tissues/organs are interconnected and physiological phenomena are mediated through vascular and neural systems. Here, the strategies are categorized according to the number of dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) of the starting materials for scaling up, and novel approaches to introduce increased complexity in 3D tissue constructs are highlighted.

     alt="Organ&#8208;Level Functional 3D Tissue Constructs with Complex Compartments and their Preclinical Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced 3D tissue models in terms of higher scale and complexity are reviewed. Organ&#8208;level 3D tissue constructs can mimic physiological/pathological features with highly networked structures of vascular/neural compartments. The novel outcomes of these models are highlighted as preclinical applications and the current limitations and future directions of this area are also discussed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest in organ&#8208;level 3D tissue constructs, owing to their mirroring of in vivo&#8208;like features. This has resulted in a wide range of preclinical applications to obtain cell&#8208; or tissue&#8208;specific responses. Additionally, the development and improvement of sophisticated technologies, such as organoid generation, microfluidics, hydrogel engineering, and 3D printing, have enhanced 3D tissue constructs to become more elaborate. In particular, recent studies have focused on including complex compartments, i.e., vascular and innervation structured 3D tissue constructs, which mimic the nature of the human body in that all tissues/organs are interconnected and physiological phenomena are mediated through vascular and neural systems. Here, the strategies are categorized according to the number of dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) of the starting materials for scaling up, and novel approaches to introduce increased complexity in 3D tissue constructs are highlighted. Recent advances in preclinical applications are also investigated to gain insight into the future direction of 3D tissue construct research. Overcoming the challenges in improving organ&#8208;level functional 3D tissue constructs both in vitro and in vivo will ultimately become a life&#8208;saving tool in the biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Nanostructures: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanostructures that can inherit the merits of both small and large ones are powerful platforms for enhanced disease theranostics with long&#8208;term retention, deep penetration, and rapid clearance. Various strategies to realize the transformation between large and small nanostructures are introduced. The biomedical application potential of this kind of nanostructures is also discussed.








Abstract
The size of nanostructures (NSs) strongly affects their chemical and physical properties and further impacts their actions in biological systems. Both small and large NSs possess respective advantages for disease theranostics, and this therefore presents a paradox when choosing NSs with suitable sizes. To overcome this challenge, size&#8208;transformable NSs have emerged as a powerful tool, as they can be manipulated to possess the merits of both types of NSs. Herein, various strategies to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs are summarized, and the recent research progress regarding their biomedical applications, particularly within the fields of cancer and bacterial theranostics, is highlighted. This review will inspire researchers to further develop various methods that can be used to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs for use in novel applications within different fields.

      <title>Dendrites in Zn&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;based batteries demonstrate both intrinsic safety and high energy density compared with other metal batteries. Nevertheless, zinc&#8208;dendrite issues such as special morphology and nucleation require unique protections, which develop rapidly and need further improvement. The remaining challenges are discussed and the future directions, i.e., dynamic contact, atomic&#8208;level ionic flow mediation, dendrite protection under high depth of discharge, etc., are proposed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries that provide a synergistic integration of absolute safety and high energy density have been considered&#160;as highly promising energy&#8208;storage systems for powering&#160;electronics. Despite the rapid progress made in developing high&#8208;performance cathodes and electrolytes, the underestimated but non&#8208;negligible dendrites of&#160;Zn anode have been observed to&#160;shorten battery lifespan. Herein, this dendrite issue in Zn anodes, with regard to fundamentals, protection strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical simulations, is systematically discussed. An overall comparison between the Zn dendrite and its Li and Al counterparts, to highlight their differences in both origin and topology, is given. Subsequently, in&#8208;depth clarifications of the specific influence factors of Zn dendrites, including the accumulation effect and the cathode loading mass (a distinct factor for laboratory studies and practical applications) are presented. Recent advances in Zn dendrite protection are then comprehensively summarized and categorized to generate an overview of respective superiorities and limitations of various strategies. Accordingly, theoretical computations and advanced characterization approaches are introduced as mechanism guidelines and measurement criteria for dendrite suppression, respectively. The concluding section emphasizes future challenges in addressing the Zn dendrite issue and potential approaches to further promoting the lifespan of Zn batteries.

      <title>Neutrophils Enable Local and Non&#8208;Invasive Liposome Delivery to Inflamed Skeletal Muscle and Ischemic Heart</title>
      <dc:description>
A neutrophil&#8208;based drug delivery system, obtained through ex vivo neutrophil loading and intravenous reinjection, is designed to transport methotrexate (MTX)&#8208;loaded liposomes to inflamed tissue. This hybrid system efficiently delivers liposomes to inflamed skeletal muscle and ischemia reperfusion injured myocardium. Upon arrival in the inflamed muscle, neutrophils release the MTX&#8208;loaded liposomes with anti&#8208;inflammatory outcome.








Abstract
Uncontrolled inflammation is a major pathological factor underlying a range of diseases including autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Improving localized delivery of immunosuppressive drugs to inflamed tissue in a non&#8208;invasive manner offers significant promise to reduce severe side effects caused by systemic administration. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;mediated delivery system able to transport drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers to inflamed tissue by exploiting the inherent ability of neutrophils to migrate to inflammatory tissue is reported. This hybrid system (neutrophils loaded with liposomes ex vivo) efficiently migrates in vitro following an inflammatory chemokine gradient. Furthermore, the triggered release of loaded liposomes and reuptake by target macrophages is studied. The migratory behavior of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils is confirmed in vivo by demonstrating the delivery of drug&#8208;loaded liposomes to an inflamed skeletal muscle in mice. A single low&#8208;dose injection of the hybrid system locally reduces inflammatory cytokine levels. Biodistribution of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils in a human&#8208;disease&#8208;relevant myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury mouse model after i.v. injection confirms the ability of injected neutrophils to carry loaded liposomes to inflammation sites. This strategy shows the potential of nanocarrier&#8208;loaded neutrophils as a universal platform to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs to promote tissue regeneration in inflammatory diseases.

      <title>Self&#8208;Winding Gelatin&#8211;Amyloid Wires for Soft Actuators and Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
A gelatin matrix is loaded with amyloid fibrils, similarly to fiber&#8208;reinforced composites. This material is dry&#8208;spun into wires with asymmetric core&#8211;shell cross&#8208;sections that develop Young's modulus gradients. In water, these wires undergo differential swelling, causing spontaneous self&#8208;winding, corresponding to climbing plants&#8217; tendrils. The functionalization of amyloid fibrils enables the fabrication of functional wires with accurate sensing and actuation properties.








Abstract
The origin of self&#8208;winding mechanisms in plants&#8217; tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries and continues to inspire developments in material science and nanotechnology. Here, bioinspired water&#8208;responsive wires that replicate these mechanisms, including the formation of coils and chiral perversions, are presented. A right&#8208;handed gelatin matrix is loaded with rigid left&#8208;handed amyloid fibrils and roll&#8211;dry&#8208;spun into wires in which self&#8208;winding activation emerges from simultaneous bending and twisting deformations. Wire bending is a consequence of amyloid fibrils&#8217; concentration and distribution within the wire, whereas twisting is controlled by amyloid fibrils&#8217; orientation. The resultant wires can be functionalized by organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles, and potential applications in magnetic actuators and sensors are demonstrated. The simple fabrication method and the remarkable spontaneous self&#8208;winding response of these gelatin&#8211;amyloid wires exemplify how biomaterials based on mixed proteins have striking potential to develop advanced and tunable properties that can serve robotics, soft machines, and engineering&#160;systems.

      <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Valleytronics</title>
      <dc:description>
An atomically thin all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, which exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction, is synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method. Robust optical helicity is observed in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are revolutionizing the renewable energy sector owing to their high photovoltaic efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility. Their remarkable mobility and long carrier lifetime are also valuable for information technology, but fundamental challenges like poor stability under an electric field prevent realistic applications of halide perovskites in electronics. Here, it is discovered that valleytronics is a promising route to leverage the advantages of halide perovskites and derivatives for information storage and processing. The synthesized all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction and parity&#8208;dependent optically addressable valley degree of freedom. Robust optical helicity in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking is observed, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first principles calculations. This discovery points to new materials design principles for scalable valleytronic devices and demonstrates the promise of perovskite derivatives beyond energy applications.

Robust optical helicity in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking is observed, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first principles calculations. This discovery points to new materials design principles for scalable valleytronic devices and demonstrates the promise of perovskite derivatives beyond energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Black Bioceramics: Combining Regeneration with Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A new generation of black bioceramics is successfully synthesized through a magnesium thermal&#8208;reduction strategy. The black bioceramics possess an excellent skin/bone tumor therapy effect while retaining their initial bioactivity, extending the functions of bioceramics from tissue regeneration to disease therapy. Such black bioceramics, with both cancer therapy and tissue regeneration, should greatly promote the scientific revival and clinical application of bioceramics.








Abstract
Bioceramics have been developed from bioinert to bioactive or biodegradable materials in the past few decades. However, at present, traditional bioceramics are still mainly used in bone tissue regeneration and dental restoration. In this work, a new generation of &#8220;black bioceramics,&#8221; extending the applications from tissue regeneration to disease therapy, is presented. Black bioceramics, through magnesium thermal reduction of traditional white ceramics, including silicate&#8208;based (e.g., CaSiO3, MgSiO3) and phosphate&#8208;based (e.g., Ca3(PO4)2, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), are successfully synthesized. Due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects, the black bioceramics possess photothermal functionality while maintaining their initial high bioactivity and regenerative capacity. These black bioceramics show excellent photothermal antitumor effects for both skin and bone tumors. At the same time, they have significantly improved bioactivity for skin/bone tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. These fascinating properties award the black bioceramics with profound applications in both tumor therapy and tissue regeneration, which should greatly promote the scientific relevance and clinical application of bioceramics, representing a promising new direction of cell&#8208;instructive biomaterials.

      <title>Material Design of Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries: Fundamental Challenges and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. The latest progress on advanced electrolyte design of ARFBs is reviewed, including a fundamental overview of their physicochemical properties, major challenges, and design strategies. Future directions for material design to realize practical applications and achieve the commercialization of ARFB energy&#8208;storage systems are highlighted.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are critical enablers for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems, due to their scalability and flexibility in decoupling power and energy. Aqueous RFBs (ARFBs) using nonflammable electrolytes are intrinsically safe. However, their development has been limited by their low energy density and high cost. Developing ARFBs with higher energy density, lower cost, and longer lifespan than the current standard is of significant interest to academic and industrial research communities. Here, a critical review of the latest progress on advanced electrolyte material designs of ARFBs is presented, including a fundamental overview of their physicochemical properties, major challenges, and design strategies. Assessment methodologies and metrics for the evaluation of RFB stability are discussed. Finally, future directions for material design to realize practical applications and achieve the commercialization of ARFB energy&#8208;storage systems are highlighted.

      <title>Photonic Fractal Metamaterials: A Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Platform with Enhanced Volatile&#8208;Compound Sensing Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Realization of photonic metamaterials is hindered by the lack of multiscale structuring techniques. The stochastically invariant features of fractals are used for engineering a tunable family of active media, consisting of plasmonic nanoresonators in porous semiconductor matrices. This architectures enhance the plasmonic volume over multiple length&#8208;scales, and excellent room&#8208;temperature sensitivity and low detection limits for volatile molecules are demonstrated.








Abstract
Advance of photonics media is restrained by the lack of structuring techniques for the 3D fabrication of active materials with long&#8208;range periodicity. A methodology is reported for the engineering of tunable resonant photonic media with thickness exceeding the plasmonic near&#8208;field enhancement region by more than two orders of magnitude. The media architecture consists of a stochastically ordered distribution of plasmonic nanocrystals in a fractal scaffold of high&#8208;index semiconductors. This plasmonic&#8208;semiconductor fractal media supports the propagation of surface plasmons with drastically enhanced intensity over multiple length scales, overcoming the 2D limitations of established metasurface technologies. The fractal media are used for the fabrication of plasmonic optical gas sensors, achieving a limit of detection of 0.01 vol% at room temperature and sensitivity up to 1.9&#160;nm vol%&#8722;1, demonstrating almost a fivefold increase with respect to an optimized planar geometry. Beneficially to their implementation, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of this fractal architecture allows fabrication of micrometer&#8208;thick media over surfaces of several square centimeters in a few seconds. The designable optical features and intrinsic scalability of these photonic fractal metamaterials provide ample opportunities for applications, bridging across transformation optics, sensing, and light harvesting.

      <title>Co&#8208;Construction of Sulfur Vacancies and Heterojunctions in Tungsten Disulfide to Induce Fast Electronic/Ionic Diffusion Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A new&#8208;type W2&#8722;x/ZnS@C composite with special sulfide vacancies and heterostructures is successfully synthesized using a facile one&#8208;step metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;engaged method, which shows excellent electrochemical performances when applied in sodium ion batteries. The rich sulfur vacancies and WS2/ZnS heterojunctions can significantly improve the ion&#8208; and electron&#8208;diffusion kinetics. In addition, a homogeneous carbon protective layer around the surface of the composite guarantees an outstanding structural stability.








Abstract
Engineering novel electrode materials with unique architectures has a significant impact on tuning the structural/electrochemical properties for boosting the performance of secondary battery systems. Herein, starting from well&#8208;organized WS2 nanorods, an ingenious design of a one&#8208;step method is proposed to prepare a bimetallic sulfide composite with a coaxial carbon coating layer, simply enabled by ZIF&#8208;8 introduction. Rich sulfur vacancies and WS2/ZnS heterojunctions can be simultaneously developed, that significantly improve ionic and electronic diffusion kinetics. In addition, a homogeneous carbon protective layer around the surface of the composite guarantees an outstanding structural stability, a reversible capacity of 170.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 5 A g&#8722;1. A great potential in practical application is also exhibited, where a full cell based on the WS2&#8722;x/ZnS@C anode and the P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode can maintain a reversible capacity of 89.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the underlying electrochemical Na storage mechanisms are illustrated in detail by theoretical calculations, electrochemical kinetic analysis, and operando X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization.

      <title>Activating Macrophage&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy by Genetically Edited Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel genetically edited nanoparticle is developed to trigger macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through a powerful two&#8208;step strategy: blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway in the first step followed by repolarizing tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in the second. This work offers a simple, safe, and effective strategy in activating the body's immune responses for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of macrophages against cancer has emerged as an encouraging therapeutic strategy. However, there exist two major challenges in effectively activating macrophages for antitumor immunotherapy. First, ligation of signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal on cancer cells, prevents macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells. Second, colony stimulating factors, secreted by cancer cells, polarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) to a tumorigenic M2 phenotype. Here, it is reported that genetically engineered cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles (gCM&#8208;MNs) can disable both mechanisms. The gCM shell genetically overexpressing SIRP&#945; variants with remarkable affinity efficiently blocks the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway while the MN core promotes M2 TAM repolarization, synergistically triggering potent macrophage immune responses. Moreover, the gCM shell protects the MNs from immune clearance; and in turn, the MN core delivers the gCMs into tumor tissues under magnetic navigation, effectively promoting their systemic circulation and tumor accumulation. In melanoma and breast cancer models, it is shown that gCM&#8208;MNs significantly prolong overall mouse survival by controlling both local tumor growth and distant tumor metastasis. The combination of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating nanotechnology and genetic editing technique offers a safe and robust strategy in activating the body's immune responses for cancer immunotherapy.

Moreover, the gCM shell protects the MNs from immune clearance; and in turn, the MN core delivers the gCMs into tumor tissues under magnetic navigation, effectively promoting their systemic circulation and tumor accumulation. In melanoma and breast cancer models, it is shown that gCM&#8208;MNs significantly prolong overall mouse survival by controlling both local tumor growth and distant tumor metastasis. The combination of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating nanotechnology and genetic editing technique offers a safe and robust strategy in activating the body's immune responses for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglows from Pure Organic Amorphous Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Smart afterglow rainbow: A facile and efficient strategy is developed to achieve colorful persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence from blue to orange&#8208;red in purely organic amorphous polymers with outstanding film&#8208;forming ability. Moreover, excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows under ambient conditions are accessed owing to the formation of diversified clustered chromophores. Such exceptional emission behaviors and excellent processability render them promising for advanced technical applications.








Abstract
Achieving persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (p&#8208;RTP), particularly those of tunable full&#8208;colors, from pure organic amorphous polymers is attractive but challenging. Particularly, those with tunable multicolor p&#8208;RTP in response to excitation wavelength and time are highly important but both fundamentally and technically underexplored. Here, a facile and general strategy toward color&#8208;tunable p&#8208;RTP from blue to orange&#8208;red based on amidation grafting of luminophores onto sodium alginate (SA) chains, resulting in amorphous polymers with distinct p&#8208;RTP and even impressively excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows is reported. p&#8208;RTP is associated with the unique semi&#8208;rigidified SA chains, effective hydrogen bonding network, and oxygen barrier properties of SA, whereas excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows should stem from the formation of diversified p&#8208;RTP emissive species with comparable but different lifetimes. These results outline a rational strategy toward amorphous smart luminophores with colorful, excitation&#8208;dependent, and time&#8208;dependent p&#8208;RTP, excellent solution processability, and film&#8208;forming ability for versatile applications.

      <title>Position&#8208; and Orientation&#8208;Controlled Growth of Wulff&#8208;Shaped Colloidal Crystals Engineered with DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by atomic epitaxial growth, patterned nanoposts on a substrate are used in conjunction with DNA&#8208;mediated nanoparticle crystallization to grow arrays of individual Wulff&#8208;shaped colloidal crystals, with control over single&#8208;crystal orientation and location. Furthermore, with this technique, substrate/crystal lattice mismatch can be manipulated systematically, something impossible to achieve with atomic epitaxy.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals have emerged as promising candidates for building optical microdevices. Techniques now exist for synthesizing them with control over their nanoscale features (e.g., particle compositions, sizes, shapes, and lattice parameters and symmetry); however, the ability to tune macroscale structural features, such as the relative positions of crystals to one another and lattice orientations, has yet to be realized. Here, inspiration is drawn from epitaxial growth strategies in atomic crystallization, and patterned substrates are prepared that, when used in conjunction with DNA&#8208;mediated nanoparticle crystallization, allow for control over individual Wulff&#8208;shaped crystal growth, location, and orientation. In addition, the approach allows exquisite control over the patterned substrate/crystal lattice mismatch, something not yet realized for any epitaxy process. This level of structural control is a significant step toward realizing complex, integrated devices with colloidal crystal components, and this approach provides a model system for further exploration in epitaxy systems.

      <title>Revealing Electrical&#8208;Poling&#8208;Induced Polarization Potential in Hybrid Perovskite Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
The photocurrent in a hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetector is modulated via the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted ion migration within perovskite crystals and, in turn, the polarization potential. The electrical poling yields a tenfold increase in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in response time in the perovskite photodetector.








Abstract
Despite recent rapid advances in metal halide perovskites for use in optoelectronics, the fundamental understanding of the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;induced ion migration, accounting for many unusual attributes and thus performance in perovskite&#8208;based devices, remain comparatively elusive. Herein, the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted polarization potential is reported for rendering hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetectors with high photocurrent and fast response time, displaying a tenfold enhancement in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in the response time after an external electric field poling. First, a robust meniscus&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;printing strategy is employed to facilitate the oriented perovskite crystals over a large area. Subsequently, the electrical poling invokes the ion migration within perovskite crystals, thus inducing a polarization potential, as substantiated by the surface potential change assessed by Kelvin probe force microscopy. Such electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;induced polarization potential is responsible for the markedly enhanced photocurrent and largely shortened response time. This work presents new insights into the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;triggered ion migration and, in turn, polarization potential as well as into the implication of the latter for optoelectronic devices with greater performance. As such, the utilization of ion&#8208;migration&#8208;produced polarization potential may represent an important endeavor toward a wide range of high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors, solar cells, transistors, scintillators, etc.

This soft robotic system will potentially enable great advancements in undercover military robots and assistive devices through the development of manufacturing and materials, and understanding the mechanics and working mechanisms and principles.








Abstract
The advent of soft robotics has led to great advancements in robots, wearables, and even manufacturing processes by employing entirely soft&#8208;bodied systems that interact safely with any random surfaces while providing great mechanical compliance. Moreover, recent developments in soft robotics involve advances in transparent soft actuators and sensors that have made it possible to construct robots that can function in a visually and mechanically unobstructed manner, assisting the operations of robots and creating more applications in various fields. In this aspect, imperceptible soft robotics that mainly consist of optically transparent imperceptible hardware components is expected to constitute a new research focus in the forthcoming era of soft robotics.

Abstract
A family of recently developed devices, hydrogel ionotronics, uses hydrogels as ionic conductors, and uses hydrophobic elastomers as dielectrics.

In doing so, a hydrophobic surface is primed to let a hydrophilic precursor wet it, and then polymers of different layers are interlinked with covalent bonds. As a representative example, an ionotronic luminescent fiber that can be lengthened to &#8776;2.5 times its original length and keeps functioning after 10&#160;000 cycles of stretching is fabricated.

      <title>The Importance of Quantifying the Composition of the Amorphous Intermixed Phase in Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk heterojunction structures with device&#8208;relevant size is determined via the analysis of the glass transition temperatures proven by fast scanning calorimetry. A relatively small fraction (&lt;15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads already to efficient charge generation. However, charge transport can only be sustained in blend morphologies with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: &#8776;58 wt%).








Abstract
The relation of phase morphology and solid&#8208;state microstructure with organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance has intensely been investigated over the last twenty years. While it has been established that a combination of donor:acceptor intermixing and presence of relatively phase&#8208;pure donor and acceptor domains is needed to get an optimum compromise between charge generation and charge transport/charge extraction, a quantitative picture of how much intermixing is needed is still lacking.

     alt="The Importance of Quantifying the Composition of the Amorphous Intermixed Phase in Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk heterojunction structures with device&#8208;relevant size is determined via the analysis of the glass transition temperatures proven by fast scanning calorimetry. A relatively small fraction (&amp;lt;15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads already to efficient charge generation. However, charge transport can only be sustained in blend morphologies with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: &#8776;58 wt%).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relation of phase morphology and solid&#8208;state microstructure with organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance has intensely been investigated over the last twenty years. While it has been established that a combination of donor:acceptor intermixing and presence of relatively phase&#8208;pure donor and acceptor domains is needed to get an optimum compromise between charge generation and charge transport/charge extraction, a quantitative picture of how much intermixing is needed is still lacking. This is mainly due to the difficulty in quantitatively analyzing the intermixed phase, which generally is amorphous. Here, fast scanning calorimetry, which allows measurement of device&#8208;relevant thin films (&amp;lt;200 nm thickness), is exploited to deduce the precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk&#8208;heterojunction structures. The power of fast scanning calorimetry is illustrated by considering two polymer:fullerene model systems. Somewhat surprisingly, it is found that a relatively small fraction (&amp;lt;15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads to efficient charge generation. In contrast, charge transport can only be sustained in blends with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: &#8776;58 wt%). This example shows that fast scanning calorimetry is an important tool for establishing a complete compositional characterization of organic bulk heterojunctions. Hence, it will be critical in advancing quantitative morphology&#8211;function models that allow for the rational design of these devices, and in delivering insights in, for example, solar cell degradation mechanisms via phase separation, especially for more complex high&#8208;performing systems such as nonfullerene acceptor:polymer bulk heterojunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methylphosphonium Tin Bromide: A 3D Perovskite Molecular Ferroelectric Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>
MPSnBr3 (MP = methylphosphonium) is the first MP&#8208;based 3D ABX3 hybrid perovskite ferroelectric semiconductor. MPSnBr3 is lead&#8208;free and shows clear ferroelectricity with the number of ferroelectric polar axes up to 12, much more than that of other hybrid perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors. MPSnBr3 also exhibits a direct bandgap of 2.62&#160;eV.








Abstract
3D ABX3 organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) semiconductors like [CH3NH3]PbI3 have received great attention because of their various properties for wide applications. However, although a number of low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;based OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors have been documented, obtaining 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors is challenging. Herein, an A&#8208;site cation [CH3PH3]+ (methylphosphonium, MP) is employed to successfully obtain a lead&#8208;free 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductor MPSnBr3, which shows clear above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity and a direct bandgap of 2.62&#160;eV. It is emphasized that MPSnBr3 is a multiaxial molecular ferroelectric with the number of ferroelectric polar axes being as many as 12, which is far more than those of the other OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors and even the classical inorganic perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors BiFeO3 (4 polar axes) and BaTiO3 (3 polar axes). MPSnBr3 is the first MP&#8208;based 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductor. This finding throws light on the exploration of other excellent 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors with great application prospects.

      <title>Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels</title>
      <dc:description>
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model was developed six decades ago to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The limitations of the old model are highlighted in this work and a new model that includes percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron distribution parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation is presented.

Abstract
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model has been used for six decades to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The model was developed for binary oxides, and, despite its significance, its accuracy has not been rigorously tested for higher&#8208;order oxides. Here, the small&#8208;polaron transport model is tested by using a spinel system with mixed cation oxidation states (MnxFe3&#8722;xO4). Using molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE), a series of single crystal MnxFe3&#8722;xO4 thin films with controlled stoichiometry, 0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 2.3, and lattice strain are grown, and the cation site&#8208;occupation is determined through X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Density functional theory + U analysis shows that charge transport occurs only between like&#8208;cations (Fe/Fe or Mn/Mn). The site&#8208;occupation data and percolation models show that there are limited stoichiometric ranges for transport along Fe and Mn pathways. Furthermore, due to asymmetric hopping barriers and formation energies, the MnOh2+ polaron is energetically preferred to the FeOh2+ polaron, resulting in an asymmetric contribution of Mn/Mn pathways. All of these findings are not contained in the conventional small&#8208;polaron hopping model, highlighting its inadequacy. To correct the model, new parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation are introduced to account for percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron&#8208;distribution, and it is found that a near&#8208;perfect correlation can be made between experiment and theory for the electronic conductivity.

      <title>Numerical Simulations and In Situ Optical Microscopy Connecting Flow Pattern, Crystallization, and Thin&#8208;Film Properties for Organic Transistors with Superior Device&#8208;to&#8208;Device Uniformity</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that can manipulate and track low patterns along its entire path is utilized, elucidating the correlation between flow pattern, crystallization process, and thin&#8208;film properties. Under the chaotic advection, unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity with the coefficient of variation (CV) in mobility of 7.3% with high average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene is achieved.








Abstract
Currently, due to the lack of precise control of flow behavior and the understanding of how it influences thin&#8208;film crystallization, strict tuning of thin&#8208;film properties during solution&#8208;based coating is difficult. In this work, a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic&#8208;channel&#8208;based meniscus&#8208;guided coating (CoMiC) is introduced, which is a system that enables manipulation of flow patterns and analysis connecting flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties. Continuous supply of a solution of an organic semiconductor with various flow patterns is generated using microfluidic channels. 3D numerical simulations and in situ microscopy allow the tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path (from within the microfluidic channel to near the liquid&#8211;solid boundary), and enable direct observation of thin&#8208;film crystallization process. In particular, the generation of chaotic flow results in unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity, with coefficient of variation (CV) of 7.3% and average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene. Furthermore, CV and average mobility of 9.6% and 11.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved, respectively, in a small molecule:polymer blend system. CoMiC can serve as a guideline for elucidating the relation between flow behavior, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition, and device performance, which has thus far been unknown.

      <title>Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs using a TADF Emitter with a Narrow Emission Spectrum and High Horizontal Emitting Dipole Ratio</title>
      <dc:description>
New blue&#8208;emitting thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters are designed and synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating rigid donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit. As a result, a deep&#8208;blue OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.3% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized.








Abstract
New blue (DBA&#8208;SAB) and deep&#8208;blue (TDBA&#8208;SAF) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating spiro&#8208;biacridine and spiro&#8208;acridine fluorene donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit, respectively. The molecules show blue and deep&#8208;blue emission because of the deep highest occupied molecular energy levels of the donor units. Besides, both emitters exhibit narrow emission spectra with the full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 65&#160;nm due to the rigid donor and acceptor units. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction results in a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio over 80%. By combining the effects, the OLED utilizing DBA&#8208;SAB as the emitter exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.7% and 1931 Commission Internationale de l'&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.144, 0.212). Even a higher efficiency deep blue TADF OLED with a maximum EQE of 28.2% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized using TDBA&#8208;SAF as the emitter.

     alt="Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs using a TADF Emitter with a Narrow Emission Spectrum and High Horizontal Emitting Dipole Ratio"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New blue&#8208;emitting thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters are designed and synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating rigid donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit. As a result, a deep&#8208;blue OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.3% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New blue (DBA&#8208;SAB) and deep&#8208;blue (TDBA&#8208;SAF) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating spiro&#8208;biacridine and spiro&#8208;acridine fluorene donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit, respectively. The molecules show blue and deep&#8208;blue emission because of the deep highest occupied molecular energy levels of the donor units. Besides, both emitters exhibit narrow emission spectra with the full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 65&#160;nm due to the rigid donor and acceptor units. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction results in a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio over 80%. By combining the effects, the OLED utilizing DBA&#8208;SAB as the emitter exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.7% and 1931 Commission Internationale de l'&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.144, 0.212). Even a higher efficiency deep blue TADF OLED with a maximum EQE of 28.2% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized using TDBA&#8208;SAF as the emitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distributed Electric Field Induces Orientations of Nanosheets to Prepare Hydrogels with Elaborate Ordered Structures and Programmed Deformations</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogels with sophisticated ordered structures at the macroscopic scale are facilely developed by using a distributed electric field to align the nanosheets (NSs), followed by polymerization and gelation. The anisotropic structures of NSs are programmable by tuning the electric field generated by the distributed multiple electrodes with specific arrangements. Upon heating or light irradiation, the composite hydrogels exhibit programmable deformations and locomotion.








Abstract
Living organisms use musculatures with spatially distributed anisotropic structures to actuate deformations and locomotion with fascinating functions. Replicating such structural features in artificial materials is of great significance yet remains a big challenge. Here, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate hydrogels with elaborate ordered structures of nanosheets (NSs) oriented under a distributed electric field. Multiple electrodes are distributed with various arrangements in the precursor solution containing NSs and gold nanoparticles. A complex electric field induces sophisticated orientations of the NSs that are permanently inscribed by subsequent photo&#8208;polymerization. The resultant anisotropic nanocomposite poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels exhibit rapid deformation upon heating or photoirradiation, owing to the fast switching of permittivity of the media and electric repulsion between the NSs. The complex alignments of NSs and anisotropic shape change of discrete regions result in programmed deformation of the hydrogels into various configurations. Furthermore, locomotion is realized by a spatiotemporal light stimulation that locally triggers time&#8208;variant shape change of the composite hydrogel with complex anisotropic structures. Such a strategy on the basis of the distributed electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated ordered structures should be applicable to gels, elastomers, and thermosets loaded with other anisotropic particles or liquid crystals, for the design of biomimetic/bioinspired materials with specific functionalities.

      <title>Oxide&#8208;Based Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistors for Spatiotemporal Information Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
An oxide&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) with prominent analog switching performance is introduced and integrated into a 32 &#215; 32 array. The EGT array is leveraged for hardware implementation of spiking neural networks to process spatiotemporal information and is further deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide&#8208;based EGT devices for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) sharing large similarity with biological nervous systems are promising to process spatiotemporal information and can provide highly time&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient computational paradigms for the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and edge computing. Nonvolatile electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGTs) provide prominent analog switching performance, the most critical feature of synaptic element, and have been recently demonstrated as a promising synaptic device. However, high performance, large&#8208;scale EGT arrays, and EGT application for spatiotemporal information processing in an SNN are yet to be demonstrated. Here, an oxide&#8208;based EGT employing amorphous Nb2O5 and LixSiO2 is introduced as the channel and electrolyte gate materials, respectively, and integrated into a 32 &#215; 32 EGT array. The engineered EGTs show a quasi&#8208;linear update, good endurance (106) and retention, a high switching speed of 100&#160;ns, ultralow readout conductance (&lt;100 nS), and ultralow areal switching energy density (20 fJ &#181;m&#8722;2). The prominent analog switching performance is leveraged for hardware implementation of an SNN with the capability of spatiotemporal information processing, where spike sequences with different timings are able to be efficiently learned and recognized by the EGT array. Finally, this EGT&#8208;based spatiotemporal information processing is deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide&#8208;based EGT devices for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.

      <title>Exploiting Colloidal Metamaterials for Achieving Unnatural Optical Refractions</title>
      <dc:description>
The colloidal self&#8208;assembly of optical metamaterials has come to the fore along with recent advances in synthetic strategies of colloids, self&#8208;assembly routes for clusters and superlattices, and effective medium theory for analyzing colloidal assemblies. In particular, unnatural optical refractions such as extremely high and negative refractive indices could be available with colloidal self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The scaling down of meta&#8208;atoms or metamolecules (collectively denoted as metaunits) is a long&#8208;lasting issue from the time when the concept of metamaterials was first suggested. According to the effective medium theory, which is the foundational concept of metamaterials, the structural sizes of meta&#8208;units should be much smaller than the working wavelengths (e.g., &lt;&lt; 1/5 wavelength). At relatively low frequency regimes (e.g., microwave and terahertz), the conventional monolithic lithography can readily address the materialization of metamaterials. However, it is still challenging to fabricate optical metamaterials (metamaterials working at optical frequencies such as the visible and near&#8208;infrared regimes) through the lithographic approaches. This serves as the rationale for using colloidal self&#8208;assembly as a strategy for the realization of optical metamaterials. Colloidal self&#8208;assembly can address various critical issues associated with the materialization of optical metamaterials, such as achieving nanogaps over a large area, increasing true 3D structural complexities, and cost&#8208;effective processing, which all are difficult to attain through monolithic lithography. Nevertheless, colloidal self&#8208;assembly is still a toolset underutilized by optical engineers. Here, the design principle of the colloidally self&#8208;assembled optical metamaterials exhibiting unnatural refractions, the practical challenge of relevant experiments, and the future opportunities are critically reviewed.

      <title>Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells</title>
      <dc:description>
Seed encapsulation in hard shells is common for protection and dispersal. This study reveals previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics on multiple length scales in (nut)shells, suggesting that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase their fracture resistance resource&#8208;efficiently.








Abstract
Many organisms encapsulate their embryos in hard, protective shells. While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D&#8208;puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber&#8208;reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource&#8208;efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell&#8208;based material applications.

      <title>HClO&#8208;Activated Fluorescence and Photosensitization from an AIE Nanoprobe for Image&#8208;Guided Bacterial Ablation in Phagocytes</title>
      <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobes with HClO&#8208;activated fluorescence and photosensitization are synthesized for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes. The fluorescence and photosensitization of the nanoprobes are selectively activated at a bacterial infection site, which facilitates the precise diagnosis and therapy for bacterial infection with no obvious side effects.








Abstract
Bacteria hiding in host phagocytes are difficult to kill, which can cause phagocyte disorders resulting in local and systemic tissue damage. Effective accumulation of activatable photosensitizers (PSs) in phagocytes to realize selective imaging and on&#8208;demand photodynamic ablation of bacteria is of great scientific and practical interests for precise bacteria diagnosis and treatment. Herein, HClO&#8208;activatable theranostic nanoprobes, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs, for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes are introduced. DTF&#8208;FFP NPs are prepared by nanoprecipitation of an HClO&#8208;responsive near&#8208;infrared molecule FFP and an efficient PS DTF with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristic using an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127 as the encapsulation matrix. As an energy acceptor, FFP can quench both fluorescence and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of DTF, thus eliminating the phototoxicity of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in normal cells and tissues. Once delivered to the infection sites, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs light up with red fluorescence and efficiently generate ROS owing to the degradation of FFP by the stimulated release of HClO in phagocytes. The selective activation of fluorescence and photosensitization is successfully confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo results, demonstrating the effectiveness and theranostic potential of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in precise bacterial therapy.

     alt="HClO&#8208;Activated Fluorescence and Photosensitization from an AIE Nanoprobe for Image&#8208;Guided Bacterial Ablation in Phagocytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobes with HClO&#8208;activated fluorescence and photosensitization are synthesized for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes. The fluorescence and photosensitization of the nanoprobes are selectively activated at a bacterial infection site, which facilitates the precise diagnosis and therapy for bacterial infection with no obvious side effects.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria hiding in host phagocytes are difficult to kill, which can cause phagocyte disorders resulting in local and systemic tissue damage. Effective accumulation of activatable photosensitizers (PSs) in phagocytes to realize selective imaging and on&#8208;demand photodynamic ablation of bacteria is of great scientific and practical interests for precise bacteria diagnosis and treatment. Herein, HClO&#8208;activatable theranostic nanoprobes, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs, for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes are introduced. DTF&#8208;FFP NPs are prepared by nanoprecipitation of an HClO&#8208;responsive near&#8208;infrared molecule FFP and an efficient PS DTF with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristic using an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127 as the encapsulation matrix. As an energy acceptor, FFP can quench both fluorescence and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of DTF, thus eliminating the phototoxicity of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in normal cells and tissues. Once delivered to the infection sites, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs light up with red fluorescence and efficiently generate ROS owing to the degradation of FFP by the stimulated release of HClO in phagocytes. The selective activation of fluorescence and photosensitization is successfully confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo results, demonstrating the effectiveness and theranostic potential of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in precise bacterial therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Pressure Nitrogen&#8208;Extraction and Effective Passivation to Attain Highest Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Module Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;pressure nitrogen&#8208;extraction strategy to drive the formation of a stable intermediate for uniform perovskite crystallization and an effective passivation strategy by utilizing an ionic liquid are reported. As such, the PCEs of a small&#8208;area PSC and a large&#8208;area PSC module are 22.7% and 19.6% respectively, representing a high level made using a large&#8208;area fabrication process.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating holds advantages over other large&#8208;scale technologies thanks to its potential for well&#8208;controlled, high&#8208;throughput, continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication. Unfortunately, it is challenging to control thin.film uniformity over a large area while maintaining crystallization quality. Herein, by using a high&#8208;pressure nitrogen&#8208;extraction (HPNE) strategy to assist crystallization, a wide processing window in the well&#8208;controlled printing process for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskites is achieved. The yellow&#8208;phase perovskite generated by the HPNE acts as a crucial intermediate phase to produce large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Furthermore, an ionic liquid is developed to passivate the perovskite surface to reduce surface defect density and to suppress carrier recombination, resulting in significantly increased efficiency to 22.7%, the highest for large&#8208;area fabrication. The strategies are successfully extended to large&#8208;area device fabrication, making it possible to produce a 40&#160;&#215;&#160;40 mm2 module with stabilized PCE as high as 19.4%, the highest&#8208;efficiency for a large&#8208;area module to date.
