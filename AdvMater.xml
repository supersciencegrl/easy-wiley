         <title>Diffusive and Drift Halide Perovskite Memristive Barristors as Nociceptive and Synaptic Emulators for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskite memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing are experimentally demonstrated. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate interfaces promote diffusive kinetics while NiOx interfaces support drift kinetics with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the switching matrix, resulting in modulatable diffusive and drift memristors respectively.








Abstract
With the current research impetus on neuromorphic computing hardware, realizing efficient drift and diffusive memristors are considered critical milestones for the implementation of readout layers, selectors, and frameworks in deep learning and reservoir computing networks. Current demonstrations are predominantly limited to oxide insulators with a soft breakdown behavior. While organic ionotronic electrochemical materials offer an attractive alternative, their implementations thus far have been limited to features exploiting ionic drift a.k.a. drift memristor technology. Development of diffusive memristors with organic electrochemical materials is still at an early stage, and modulation of their switching dynamics remains unexplored. Here, halide perovskite (HP) memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. An ion permissive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate interface that promotes diffusive kinetics and an ion source nickel oxide (NiOx) interface that supports drift kinetics are identified to design diffusive and drift memristors, respectively, with methylammonuim lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as the switching matrix. In line with the recent interest on developing artificial afferent nerves as information channels bridging sensors and artificial neural networks, these HP memristive barristors are fashioned as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing.

         <title>Conformal Geometry and Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing through Freeform Transformation of Building Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing process that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation of individual build layers while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques is reported. Individually manipulating each build layer within the sequential layered manufacturing process allows digital transformation of 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly; printing of conformal geometry to ensure custom fitting of vascular scaffolds; and realization of multiaxis, multimaterials 3D printing of soft robotic actuators.








Abstract
3D printing, formally known as additive manufacturing, creates complex geometries via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer addition of materials. While 3D printing has been historically perceived as the static addition of build layers, 3D printing is now considered as a dynamic assembly process. In this context, here a new 3D printing process is reported that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation (translating, rotating, and scaling) of each individual building layer while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques. Transforming individual building layers within the sequential layered manufacturing process enables dynamic transformation of the 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, eliminating the time&#8208;consuming redesign steps. Preserving the locality of the transformation to each layer further enables the discrete conformal transformation, allowing objects such as vascular scaffolds to be optimally fabricated to properly fit within specific patient anatomy obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Finally, exploiting the freedom to control the orientation of each individual building layer, multimaterials, multiaxis 3D printing capability are further established for integrating functional modules made of dissimilar materials in 3D printed devices. This final capability is demonstrated through 3D printing a soft pneumatic gripper via heterogenous integration of rigid base and soft actuating limbs.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for In Situ Construction of Highly Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase to Enable High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrolyte design strategy for in situ solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) construction is proposed in aqueous Zn chemistry to stabilize the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interface. Apart from the realization of high Zn reversibility and utilization, the exploitation of the robust in situ SEI enables significantly enhanced cyclability of Zn/V2O5 full cells under practical conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries promise high capacity, low cost, high safety, and sustainability for large&#8208;scale energy storage. The Zn metal anode, however, suffers from the dendrite growth and side reactions that are mainly due to the absence of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, the in situ formation of a dense, stable, and highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI layer (hopeite) in aqueous Zn chemistry is demonstrated, by introducing Zn(H2PO4)2 salt into the electrolyte. The hopeite SEI (&#8776;140&#160;nm thickness) enables uniform and rapid Zn&#8208;ion transport kinetics for dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and restrains the side reactions via isolating active Zn from the bulk electrolyte. Under practical testing conditions with an ultrathin Zn anode (10&#160;&#181;m), a low negative/positive capacity ratio (&#8776;2.3), and a lean electrolyte (9&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), the Zn/V2O5 full cell retains 94.4% of its original capacity after 500 cycles. This work provides a simple yet practical solution to high&#8208;performance aqueous battery technology via building in situ SEI layers.

         <title>Sequential Coevaporation and Deposition of Antimony Selenosulfide Thin Film for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential coevaporation technique of Sb2Se3 and sulfur powders is developed for the deposition of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) thin film, from which it is discovered that the interfacial properties, source&#8211;substrate distance, and temperature of the substrate conjugatedly affect the structural and electrical properties. The corresponding device delivers a champion efficiency of 8.0% in the vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived alloy&#8208;type Sb2(S,Se)3 films.








Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is an emerging low&#8208;cost, nontoxic solar material with suitable bandgap and high absorption coefficient. Developing effective methods for fabricating high&#8208;quality films would benefit the device efficiency improvement and deepen the fundamental understanding on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, equipment is developed that allows online introduction of precursor vapor during the reaction process, enabling sequential coevaporation of Sb2Se3 and S powders for the deposition of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films. With this unique ability, it is revealed that the deposition sequence manipulates both the interfacial properties and optoelectronic properties of the absorber film. A power conversion efficiency of 8.0% is achieved, which is the largest value in vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. The research demonstrates that multi&#8208;source sequential coevaporation is an efficient technique to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Growth Regulation Enables Sensitive Broadband Detection and Imaging of Polarized Photons Covering 300&#8211;1050&#160;nm</title>

Polarization photodetectors with solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA=methylammonium) polycrystalline film as photoactive layer are designed to sensitively detect and image the polarized photons from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. Additives play an important role in regulating oriented crystal growth. This low&#8208;cost and facile fabrication process can pave the way for universal application of polarization photodetectors toward accurate target recognition in military and civilian fields.








Abstract
Photodetectors selective to the polarization empower breakthroughs in sensing technology for target identification. However, the realization of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on intrinsically anisotropic crystal structure or extrinsically anisotropic device pattern requires complicated epitaxy and etching processes, which limit scalable production and application. Here, solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA= methylammonium) polycrystalline film is probed as photoactive layer toward sensing polarized photon from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. The growth of the PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 crystal occurs in confined crystallographic orientation of the (202) facet upon the assistance of NH4SCN and NH4Cl, enhancing anisotropic photoelectric properties. Therefore, the photodetector achieves a polarization ratio of 0.41 and dichroism ratio (Imax/Imin) of 2.4 at 900&#160;nm. At 520&#160;nm, the Imax/Imin even surpasses the one of the perovskite crystalline films, 1.8 and &#8776;1.2, respectively. It is worth noting that the superior figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits possess a response width of 900&#160;kHz, Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 108, linear dynamic range from 0.15 nW to 12&#160;mW, noise current of 8.28 &#215; 10&#8722;13 A &#215; Hz&#8722;0.5, and specific detectivity of 1.53 &#215; 1012 Jones, which demonstrate high resolution and high speed for weak signal sensing and imaging. The proof of concept in polarized imaging confirms that the polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector meets the requirements for practical application in target recognition.

         <title>In Vivo Three&#8208;Photon Imaging of Lipids using Ultrabright Fluorogens with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) dots in an aqueous medium are synthesized for in vivo labeling of lipids. The ultrabright fluorescence in the far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (quantum yield of 26%) enables intravital three&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging of lipids in fatty liver and atherosclerotic plaques in brain vasculatures and carotid arteries under NIR&#8208;II laser excitation.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of in vivo lipids labeling are highly desirable for studying lipid&#8208;accumulation&#8208;related metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type&#8208;2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, most of the current lipid&#8208;specific fluorophores cannot be used for in vivo labeling due to their strong hydrophobicity. Herein, organic dots from bright luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgen) are developed for in vivo labeling and three&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging of lipid&#8208;rich tissues, such as fatty liver, atherosclerotic plaques in brain vasculatures, and carotid arteries. The organic dots show excellent stability in an aqueous medium with high targeting specificity to lipids and strong three&#8208;photon fluorescence in the far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region under NIR&#8208;II laser excitation, which enables efficient in vivo labeling and imaging of lipids in deep tissues. The study will inspire the development of lipid&#8208;targeting fluorophores for in vivo applications.

         <title>Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels with Broad&#8208;Range Tunable Mechanical Properties via the Hofmeister Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freeze&#8208;soak strategy is proposed to make hydrogels with broad&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties via the Hofmeister effect. Because of the various aggregation degrees of the polymers chains induced by the Hofmeister effect, hydrogels with ultrahigh&#8208;toughness and wide&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties can be made by changing the salt types and concentrations. Meanwhile, the mechanics of the hydrogel can be in situ tuned dynamically.








Abstract
Hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in soft robotics, tissue engineering, implantable electronics, etc., often require sophisticately tailoring of the hydrogel mechanical properties to meet specific demands. For examples, soft robotics necessitates tough hydrogels; stem cell culturing demands various tissue&#8208;matching modulus; and neuron probes desire dynamically tunable modulus. Herein, a strategy to broadly alter the mechanical properties of hydrogels reversibly via tuning the aggregation states of the polymer chains by ions based on the Hofmeister effect is reported. An ultratough poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as an exemplary material (toughness 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which surpasses synthetic polymers like poly(dimethylsiloxane), synthetic rubber, and natural spider silk is fabricated. With various ions, the hydrogel's various mechanical properties are continuously and reversibly in situ modulated over a large window: tensile strength from 50 &#177; 9&#160;kPa to 15 &#177; 1&#160;MPa, toughness from 0.0167&#160;&#177; 0.003 to 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, elongation from 300&#160;&#177; 100% to 2100&#160;&#177; 300%, and modulus from 24 &#177; 2 to 2500 &#177; 140&#160;kPa. Importantly, the ions serve as gelation triggers and property modulators only, not necessarily required to remain in the gel, maintaining the high biocompatibility of PVA without excess ions. This strategy, enabling high mechanical performance and broad dynamic tunability, presents a universal platform for broad applications from biomedicine to wearable electronics.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled, Scalable Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH Nanosheet Arrays on Nickel Foam toward Efficient Oxygen Evolution: The Key Role of In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Generated &#947;&#8208;NiOOH</title>

         <dc:description>
The controllable and scalable synthesis of &#947;&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide (&#947;&#8208;FeOOH) nanosheets arrays (NAs) on diverse substrates is achieved via one&#8208;step hydrolysis of K2FeO4 in NaOH solution under ambient conditions, where NaOH decides the hydrolysis pathway and kinetics of K2FeO4. Benefiting from the optimized nanostructure and electrooxidation&#8208;generated &#947;&#8208;NiOOH, the &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs on nickel foam system exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Layered &#947;&#8208;type iron oxyhydroxide (&#947;&#8208;FeOOH) is a promising material for various applications; however, its sheet&#8208;shaped structure often suffers from instability that results in aggregation and leads to inferior performance. Herein, a kinetically controlled hydrolysis strategy is proposed for the scalable synthesis of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH nanosheets arrays (NAs) with enhanced structural stability on diverse substrates at ambient conditions. The underlying mechanisms for the growth of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs associated with their structural evolution are systematically elucidated by alkalinity&#8208;controlled synthesis and time&#8208;dependent experiments. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs are developed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the sample grown on nickel foam (NF) exhibits superior performance of high catalytic current density, small Tafel slope, and exceptional durability, which is among the top level of FeOOH&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that &#947;&#8208;NiOOH in situ generated from the electrooxidation of NF would induce charge accumulation on the Fe sites of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs, leading to enhanced OER intermediates adsorption for water splitting. This work affords a new technique to rationally design and synthesize &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs for various applications.

The underlying mechanisms for the growth of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs associated with their structural evolution are systematically elucidated by alkalinity&#8208;controlled synthesis and time&#8208;dependent experiments. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs are developed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the sample grown on nickel foam (NF) exhibits superior performance of high catalytic current density, small Tafel slope, and exceptional durability, which is among the top level of FeOOH&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that &#947;&#8208;NiOOH in situ generated from the electrooxidation of NF would induce charge accumulation on the Fe sites of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs, leading to enhanced OER intermediates adsorption for water splitting. This work affords a new technique to rationally design and synthesize &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronic States Modulation by Coherent Optical Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The&#160;modulation of the excitonic properties of 2D perovskites by coherent optical phonons is investigated using comprehensive optical spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. A clear understanding of these phonon modulation mechanisms injects fresh insights into the exciton&#8211;phonon coupling in 2D perovskites, which may help unlock new optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Excitonic effects underpin the fascinating optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites that are highly favorable for photovoltaics and light&#8208;emitting devices. Analogous to switching in transistors, manipulating these excitonic properties in 2D perovskites using coherent phonons could unlock new applications. Presently, a detailed understanding of this underlying mechanism remains modest. Herein, the origins of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in 2D perovskites using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy are explicated. The exciton fine structure is modulated by coherent optical phonons dominated by the vibrational motion of the PbI6 octahedra via deformation potential. Originating from impulsive stimulated Raman scattering, these coherent vibrations manifest as oscillations in the TA spectrum comprising of the generation and detection processes of coherent phonons. This two&#8208;step process leads to a unique pump&#8208; and probe&#8208;energy dependence of the phonon modulation determined by the imaginary part of the refractive index and its derivative, respectively. The phonon frequency and lattice displacement of the inorganic octahedra are highly dependent on the organic cation. This study injects fresh insights into the exciton&#8211;phonon coupling of 2D perovskites relevant for emergent optoelectronics development.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Zn2+ Ion Flux and Desolvation Effect Enabled by Anodic Growth of a 3D ZnF2 Matrix for Long&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) is prepared through a simple and fast electrochemical anodic growth method. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the intrinsic high volumetric capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the low Coulombic efficiency and limited lifespan of Zn metal anodes resulting from uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites impede their practical application. In this work, a 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix is designed on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) through a simple and fast anodic growth method, serving as a multifunctional protective layer. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics. The results reveal that the Zn@ZnF2 electrode can effectively inhibit dendrites growth, restrain the hydrogen evolution reactions, and endow excellent plating/stripping reversibility. Accordingly, the Zn@ZnF2 electrode exhibits a long cycle life of over 800 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell test, the feasibility of which is also convincing in Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 and Zn@ZnF2//V2O5 full batteries. Importantly, a hybrid zinc&#8208;ion capacitor of the Zn@ZnF2//AC can work at an ultrahigh current density of &#8776;60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for up to 5000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 92.8%.

         <title>Constructing Li&#8208;Rich Artificial SEI Layer in Alloy&#8211;Polymer Composite Electrolyte to Achieve High Ionic Conductivity for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A Li&#8208;rich artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer about 60 nm thick is successfully designed and constructed in a Li alloy filled poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolyte to achieve high ionic conductivity for lithium metal batteries. The LiFePO4|Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit high cycling performance of 111.3 mA h g&#8211;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C in 45 &#176;C.








Abstract
To achieve high ionic conductivity for solid electrolyte, an artificial Li&#8208;rich interface layer of about 60&#160;nm thick has been constructed in polymer&#8208;based poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide composite solid electrolyte (briefly noted as PEOm) by adding Li&#8208;based alloys. As revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, an artificial interface layer of amorphous feature is created around the Li&#8208;based alloy particles with the gradient distribution of Li across it. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the interface layer provides fast ion transport path and plays a key role in achieving high and stable ionic conductivity for PEOm&#8208;Li21Si5 composite solid electrolyte. The PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 composite electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.9 &#215; 10&#8211;5&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C and 5.6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#160;&#176;C. The LiFePO4 | PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 | Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries could maintain a stable capacity of 129.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 30&#160;&#176;C after 100 cycles, and 111.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 45&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability.

         <title>Stamping Flexible Li Alloy Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by an ancient topography technology, a thin (15 &#181;m) and flexible Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode is achieved with excellent electrochemical performance and good safety. A range of printed patterns on various substrates can be obtained using the stamping process. The printed Li&#8211;Sn alloy has an areal capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8211;2, which can match that of the most typical commercial cathodes.








Abstract
Li metal holds great promise to be the ultimate anode choice owing to its high specific capacity and low redox potential. However, processing Li metal into thin&#8208;film anode with high electrochemical performance and good safety to match commercial cathodes remains challenging. Herein, a new method is reported to prepare ultrathin, flexible, and high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;Sn alloy anodes with various shapes on a number of substrates by directly stamping a molten metal solution. The printed anode is as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m, corresponding to an areal capacity of &#8776;3 mAh cm&#8211;2 that matches most commercial cathode materials. The incorporation of Sn provides the nucleation center for Li, thereby mitigating Li dendrites as well as decreasing the overpotential during Li stripping/plating (e.g., &lt;10&#160;mV at 0.25&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a flexible Li&#8208;ion battery using the ultrathin Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode and a commercial NMC cathode demonstrates good electrochemical performance and reliable cell operation even after repetitive deformation. The approach can be extended to other metal/alloy anodes such as Na, K, and Mg.

     alt="Stamping Flexible Li Alloy Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by an ancient topography technology, a thin (15 &#181;m) and flexible Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode is achieved with excellent electrochemical performance and good safety. A range of printed patterns on various substrates can be obtained using the stamping process. The printed Li&#8211;Sn alloy has an areal capacity of 3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which can match that of the most typical commercial cathodes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li metal holds great promise to be the ultimate anode choice owing to its high specific capacity and low redox potential. However, processing Li metal into thin&#8208;film anode with high electrochemical performance and good safety to match commercial cathodes remains challenging. Herein, a new method is reported to prepare ultrathin, flexible, and high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;Sn alloy anodes with various shapes on a number of substrates by directly stamping a molten metal solution. The printed anode is as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m, corresponding to an areal capacity of &#8776;3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; that matches most commercial cathode materials. The incorporation of Sn provides the nucleation center for Li, thereby mitigating Li dendrites as well as decreasing the overpotential during Li stripping/plating (e.g., &amp;lt;10&#160;mV at 0.25&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a flexible Li&#8208;ion battery using the ultrathin Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode and a commercial NMC cathode demonstrates good electrochemical performance and reliable cell operation even after repetitive deformation. The approach can be extended to other metal/alloy anodes such as Na, K, and Mg. This study opens a new door toward the future development of high&#8208;performance ultrathin alloy&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unraveling the Important Role of High&#8208;Lying Triplet&#8211;Lowest Excited Singlet Transitions in Achieving Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue AIE&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficient spin transition between a high&#8208;lying excited triplet state and the lowest excited singlet state in aggregation&#8208;induced emission materials is demonstrated by magnetic field effects. A highly efficient deep&#8208;blue aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) is achieved by further regulating utilization of excitons, which shows an excellent external quantum efficiency of 10.2%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a high brightness of 16 817 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) materials are attractive for achieving highly efficient nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their strong luminescence in the solid state. However, the electroluminescence efficiency of most AIE&#8208;based OLEDs remains low owing to the waste of triplet excitons. Here, using theoretical calculations, photophysical dynamics, and magnetoluminescence measurements, the spin conversion process is demonstrated between the high&#8208;lying triplet state (Tn) and the lowest excited singlet state (S1) in AIE materials. Moreover, the relative positions of Tn (n&#160;&lt;&#160;4) and S1 are shown to have a significant impact on the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency, thus influencing the harvesting of triplet excitons and the device efficiency. Finally, by selecting an upconversion material with an appropriate energy level for further utilizing the triplet excitons, a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent OLED with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.08), a&#160;maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.2%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a high brightness of 16817&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is developed. This is one of the most efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on AIE materials reported so far. These findings also provide new insights into the design of more efficient AIE molecules and corresponding OLEDs by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.

         <title>A Multifunctional Origami Patch for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional patch presents new opportunities for sealing tissues in minimally invasive surgeries. Integration of a dynamic hydrophobic fluid layer, a microtextured bioadhesive layer, and a zwitterionic&#8208;interpenetrated elastomer layer enables the patch to withstand fluid&#8208;rich environments, maintain a robust seal, and minimize biofouling and inflammation. By employing various origami&#8208;based designs, the patch can be adapted for different clinical applications.








Abstract
For decades, bioadhesive materials have garnered great attention due to their potential to replace sutures and staples for sealing tissues during minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, the complexities of delivering bioadhesives through narrow spaces and achieving strong adhesion in fluid&#8208;rich physiological environments continue to present substantial limitations to the surgical translation of existing sealants. In this work, a new strategy for minimally invasive tissue sealing based on a multilayer bioadhesive patch, which is designed to repel body fluids, to form fast, pressure&#8208;triggered adhesion with wet tissues, and to resist biofouling and inflammation is introduced. The multifunctional patch is realized by a synergistic combination of three distinct functional layers: i) a microtextured bioadhesive layer, ii) a dynamic, blood&#8208;repellent hydrophobic fluid layer, and iii) an antifouling zwitterionic nonadhesive layer. The patch is capable of forming robust adhesion to tissue surfaces in the presence of blood, and exhibits superior resistance to bacterial adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, and in vivo fibrous capsule formation. By adopting origami&#8208;based fabrication strategies, it is demonstrated that the patch can be readily integrated with a variety of minimally invasive end effectors to provide facile tissue sealing in ex vivo porcine models, offering new opportunities for minimally invasive tissue sealing in diverse clinical scenarios.

         <title>A Mechanically Robust and Versatile Liquid&#8208;Free Ionic Conductive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel liquid&#8208;free ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) that possesses excellent mechanical properties and overcomes some of the intrinsic shortcomings of gel&#8208;based ionic conductors, for example leakage and evaporation, is designed. A series of ICE&#8208;based liquid&#8208;free ionotronic devices, including resistive sensors, ionic skins, and triboelectric nanogenerators, is presented. The processability of the material is further demonstrated via 3D printing.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, such as hydrogels and ionogels, have enabled stretchable and transparent ionotronics, but they suffer from key limitations inherent to the liquid components, which may leak and evaporate. Here, novel liquid&#8208;free ionic conductive elastomers (ICE) that are copolymer networks hosting lithium cations and associated anions via lithium bonds and hydrogen bonds are demonstrated, such that they are intrinsically immune from leakage and evaporation. The ICEs show extraordinary mechanical versatility including excellent stretchability, high strength and toughness, self&#8208;healing, quick self&#8208;recovery, and 3D&#8208;printability. More intriguingly, the ICEs can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness&#8212;a compromise well recognized in mechanics and material science&#8212;and simultaneously overcome the conflict between ionic conductivity and mechanical properties, which is common for ionogels. Several liquid&#8208;free ionotronics based on the ICE are further developed, including resistive force sensors, multifunctional ionic skins, and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which are not subject to limitations of previous gel&#8208;based devices, such as leakage, evaporation, and weak hydrogel&#8211;elastomer interfaces. Also, the 3D printability of the ICEs is demonstrated by printing a series of structures with fine features. The findings offer promise for a variety of ionotronics requiring environmental stability and durability.

         <title>Translocation of DNA through Ultrathin Nanoslits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, is studied, and the DNA polymer behavior in this tight confinement is examined. DNA molecules, including folds and knots, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions with the confining graphene surfaces.








Abstract
2D nanoslit devices, where two crystals with atomically flat surfaces are separated by only a few nanometers, have attracted considerable attention because their tunable control over the confinement allows for the discovery of unusual transport behavior of gas, water, and ions. Here, the passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules is studied through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, and the DNA polymer behavior is examined in this tight confinement. Two types of events are observed in the ionic current: long current blockades that signal DNA translocation and short spikes where DNA enters the slits but withdraws. DNA translocation events exhibit three distinct phases in their current&#8208;blockade traces&#8212;loading, translation, and exit. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation allows the different polymer configurations of these phases to be identified. DNA molecules, including folds and knots in their polymer structure, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions of DNA with the confining graphene surfaces. It is anticipated that this new class of 2D&#8208;nanoslit devices will provide unique ways to study polymer physics and enable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip biotechnology.

         <title>Electrically Insulating Flexible Films with Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Fillers as Efficient Electromagnetic Shields in the GHz and Sub&#8208;THz Frequency Bands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer composite films with fillers of exfoliated quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials are described. Such composites with low loadings of TaSe3 reveal excellent electromagnetic shielding in the GHz and sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining electrically insulating. These novel films are promising for communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and insulating.








Abstract
Polymer composite films containing fillers comprising quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials, specifically transition metal trichalcogenides with 1D&#160;structural motifs that enable their exfoliation into bundles of atomic threads, are reported. These nanostructures are characterized by extremely large aspect ratios of up to &#8776;106. The polymer composites with low loadings of quasi&#8208;1D TaSe3 fillers (&lt;3&#160;vol%) reveal excellent electromagnetic interference shielding in the X&#8208;band GHz and extremely high frequency sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining DC electrically insulating. The unique electromagnetic shielding characteristics of these films are attributed to effective coupling of the electromagnetic waves to the high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio electrically conductive TaSe3 atomic&#8208;thread bundles even when the filler concentration is below the electrical percolation threshold. These novel films are promising for high&#8208;frequency communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and electrically insulating.

         <title>Guided Mid&#8208;IR and Near&#8208;IR Light within a Hybrid Hyperbolic&#8208;Material/Silicon Waveguide Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid platform composed of a hexagonal boron nitride slab and silicon waveguide enables guiding at both mid&#8208;infrared and near&#8208;infrared simultaneously. Theoretical calculations and infrared nanoimaging are applied to study the guided mid&#8208;infrared hyperbolic polaritons. The performance in the near&#8208;infrared is verified via transmission measurements and simulations. This demonstrates an approach to integrate hyperbolic media with silicon photonics.








Abstract
Silicon waveguides have enabled large&#8208;scale manipulation and processing of near&#8208;infrared optical signals on chip. Yet, expanding the bandwidth of guided waves to other frequencies will further increase the functionality of silicon as a photonics platform. Frequency multiplexing by integrating additional architectures is one approach to the problem, but this is challenging to design and integrate within the existing form factor due to scaling with the free&#8208;space wavelength. This paper demonstrates that a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/silicon hybrid waveguide can simultaneously enable dual&#8208;band operation at both mid&#8208;infrared (6.5&#8211;7.0&#160;&#181;m) and telecom (1.55&#160;&#181;m) frequencies, respectively. The device is realized via the lithography&#8208;free transfer of hBN onto a silicon waveguide, maintaining near&#8208;infrared operation. In addition, mid&#8208;infrared waveguiding of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) supported in hBN is induced by the index contrast between the silicon waveguide and the surrounding air underneath the hBN, thereby eliminating the need for deleterious etching of the hyperbolic medium. The behavior of HPhP waveguiding in both straight and curved trajectories is validated within an analytical waveguide theoretical framework. This exemplifies a generalizable approach based on integrating hyperbolic media with silicon photonics for realizing frequency multiplexing in on&#8208;chip photonic systems.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Cholesterol&#8208;Decorated DNA Nanoflowers for Intracellular Ratiometric Aptasensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite (DNA nanoflower) intracellular aptasensor with sequence&#8208;encoded multifunctional features is realized by implementing enzymatic amplification&#8208;driven biomimetic crystallization. This platform is capable of ratiometric and quantitative intracellular detection upon targeted delivery and holds substantial promise as strategically self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosensors for interrogating cellular analytes whose changes in abundance are explained as a continuous function.








Abstract
Probing endogenous molecular profiles is of fundamental importance to understand cellular function and processes. Despite the promise of programmable nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based aptasensors across the breadth of biomolecular detection, target&#8208;responsive aptasensors enabling intracellular detection are as of yet infrequently realized. Several challenges remain, including the difficulties in quantification/normalization of quencher&#8208;based intensiometric signals, stability issues of the probe architecture, and complex sensor operations often necessitating extensive structural modeling. Here, the biomimetic crystallization&#8208;empowered self&#8208;assembly of a tumor&#8208;targetable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite aptasensor is presented, which enables F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based quantitative interpretation of changes in the cellular target abundance. Leveraging the design programmability and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of rolling circle amplification&#8208;driven DNA nanoarchitecture, this designer platform offers a method to self&#8208;assemble a robust nanosensor from a multifunctionality&#8208;encoded template that includes a cell&#8208;targeting aptamer, a ratiometric aptasensor, and a cholesterol&#8208;decorating element. Taking prostate cancer cells and intracellular adenosine triphosphate molecules as a model system, a synergistic effect in the targeted delivery by cholesterol and aptamers, and the feasibility of quantitative intracellular aptasensing are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this approach provides a highly generalizable strategy across wide&#8208;ranging target systems toward a biologically deliverable nanosensor that enables quantitative monitoring of the abundance of endogenous biomolecules.

         <title>Hybrid Waveguides: Guided Mid&#8208;IR and Near&#8208;IR Light within a Hybrid Hyperbolic&#8208;Material/Silicon Waveguide Heterostructure (Adv. Mater. 11/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated silicon photonics works in the near&#8208;infrared with bandwidth limited to the number of channels that can physically fit within a given chip. In article number 2004305, Joshua D. Caldwell and co&#8208;workers report a hybrid heterostructure system composed of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab on top of a silicon waveguide to realize multiplexing of both near&#8208; and mid&#8208;infrared signals. The sub&#8208;diffractional hyperbolic polaritons supported in hBN are guided by the underlying silicon structure, propagating with, but not influencing, the near&#8208;IR signal.

&lt;p&gt;Integrated silicon photonics works in the near&#8208;infrared with bandwidth limited to the number of channels that can physically fit within a given chip. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004305"&gt;2004305&lt;/a&gt;, Joshua D. Caldwell and co&#8208;workers report a hybrid heterostructure system composed of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab on top of a silicon waveguide to realize multiplexing of both near&#8208; and mid&#8208;infrared signals. The sub&#8208;diffractional hyperbolic polaritons supported in hBN are guided by the underlying silicon structure, propagating with, but not influencing, the near&#8208;IR signal.

         <title>Nonlinear Photonics Using Low&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites: Recent Advances and Future Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts. A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208; and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their widespread practical applications, is provided.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited significantly superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts, thanks to their peculiar physical and electronic structures. Their exceptional nonlinear optical characteristics make them excellent candidates for revolutionizing widespread applications. However, the research of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites is in its infancy. There is a lack of comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of this research realm. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208;and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their practical applications, is summarized comprehensively. Critical discussions are offered on the&#160;fundamental mechanisms beneath their exceptional nonlinear optical performance&#160;from the physics viewpoint, attempting to disclose the role of intrinsic attributes (e.g., composition, bandgap, size, shape, and structure) and external modulation strategies (e.g., developing core&#8211;shell structures, transition metal ion doping, and hybridization with dielectric microspheres) in tuning the response. Additionally, their potential applications in nonlinear photonics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and biophotonics are systematically and thoroughly summed up and categorized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited significantly superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts, thanks to their peculiar physical and electronic structures. Their exceptional nonlinear optical characteristics make them excellent candidates for revolutionizing widespread applications. However, the research of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites is in its infancy. There is a lack of comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of this research realm. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208;and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their practical applications, is summarized comprehensively. Critical discussions are offered on the&#160;fundamental mechanisms beneath their exceptional nonlinear optical performance&#160;from the physics viewpoint, attempting to disclose the role of intrinsic attributes (e.g., composition, bandgap, size, shape, and structure) and external modulation strategies (e.g., developing core&#8211;shell structures, transition metal ion doping, and hybridization with dielectric microspheres) in tuning the response. Additionally, their potential applications in nonlinear photonics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and biophotonics are systematically and thoroughly summed up and categorized. Lastly, insights into the current technical challenges and future research opportunities of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Progress in Epitaxial Thin&#8208;Film Na3Bi as a Topological Electronic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3Bi displays remarkable thickness&#8208;dependent properties, from bulk topological Dirac semimetal to wide&#8208;bandgap 2D topological insulator in ultrathin films with electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological switching. An overview of the recent progress on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area epitaxial films, and an outlook toward challenges and opportunities for applications to the next generation of topological electronic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Trisodium bismuthide (Na3Bi) is the first experimentally verified topological Dirac semimetal, and is a 3D analogue of graphene hosting relativistic Dirac fermions. Its unconventional momentum&#8211;energy relationship is interesting from a fundamental perspective, yielding exciting physical properties such as chiral charge carriers, the chiral anomaly, and weak anti&#8208;localization. It also shows promise for realizing topological electronic devices such as topological transistors. Herein, an overview of the substantial progress achieved in the last few years on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy. Key theoretical aspects underpinning the unique electronic properties of Na3Bi are introduced. Next, the growth process on different substrates is reviewed. Spectroscopic and microscopic features are illustrated, and an analysis of semiclassical and quantum transport phenomena in different doping regimes is provided. The emergent properties arising from confinement in two dimensions, including thickness&#8208;dependent and electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological phase transitions, are addressed, with an outlook toward current challenges and expected future progress.

         <title>Integrating Computational and Experimental Workflows for Accelerated Organic Materials Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discussion of the power of integrating computational and experimental materials discovery programmes for organic material discovery is provided, including the use of artificial intelligence techniques and automation. An overview of the different situations where combined approaches are effective is given, along with a series of case studies demonstrating recent successes.








Abstract
Organic materials find application in a range of areas, including optoelectronics, sensing, encapsulation, molecular separations, and photocatalysis. The discovery of materials is frustratingly slow however, particularly when contrasted to the vast chemical space of possibilities based on the near limitless options for organic molecular precursors. The difficulty in predicting the material assembly, and consequent properties, of any molecule is another significant roadblock to targeted materials design. There has been significant progress in the development of computational approaches to screen large numbers of materials, for both their structure and properties, helping guide synthetic researchers toward promising materials. In particular, artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to make significant impact in many elements of the discovery process. Alongside this, automation and robotics are increasing the scale and speed with which materials synthesis can be realized. Herein, the focus is on demonstrating the power of integrating computational and experimental materials discovery programmes, including both a summary of key situations where approaches can be combined and a series of case studies that demonstrate recent successes.

         <title>Recent Progress on Nanocellulose Aerogels: Preparation, Modification, Composite Fabrication, Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocellulose aerogels are summarized in terms of their preparation methods, modification strategies, properties, and their inclusion in composites with various other compounds. Their applications with recent advancements in various fields are also presented. Finally, some conclusions and brief future prospects regarding nanocellulose aerogels are discussed.








Abstract
The rapid development of modern industry and excessive consumption of petroleum&#8208;based polymers have triggered a double crisis presenting a shortage of nonrenewable resources and environmental pollution. However, this has provided an opportunity to stimulate researchers to harness native biobased materials for novel advanced materials and applications. Nanocellulose&#8208;based aerogels, using abundant and sustainable cellulose as raw material, present a third&#8208;generation of aerogels that combine traditional aerogels with high porosity and large specific surface area, as well as the excellent properties of cellulose itself. Currently, nanocellulose aerogels provide a highly attention&#8208;catching platform for a wide range of functional applications in various fields, e.g., adsorption, separation, energy storage, thermal insulation, electromagnetic interference shielding, and biomedical applications. Here, the preparation methods, modification strategies, composite fabrications, and further applications of nanocellulose aerogels are summarized, with additional discussions regarding the prospects and potential challenges in future development.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Soft Sensors: From Material Design to Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of self&#8208;healing soft sensing platforms is presented and discussed, while pointing out pathways to be followed by materials designers, synthetic chemists, and engineers for developing further high&#8208;performance and durable sensing devices.








Abstract
The demand for interfacing electronics in everyday life is rapidly accelerating, with an ever&#8208;growing number of applications in wearable electronics and electronic skins for robotics, prosthetics, and other purposes. Soft sensors that efficiently detect environmental or biological/physiological stimuli have been extensively studied due to their essential role in creating the necessary interfaces for these applications. Unfortunately, due to their natural softness, these sensors are highly sensitive to structural and mechanical damage. The integration of natural properties, such as self&#8208;healing, into these systems should improve their reliability, stability, and long&#8208;term performance. Recent studies on self&#8208;healing soft sensors for varying chemical and physical parameters are herein reviewed. In addition, contemporary studies on material design, device structure, and fabrication methods for sensing platforms are also discussed. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives in this field are introduced, while focusing on the most promising examples and directions already reported.

         <title>General Programmable Growth of Hybrid Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures with Liquid Metal Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>

A general programmable strategy to fabricate core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal nanodroplets as reformable core templates is demonstrated, offering a route to producing nanostructures with multiple, complex, and desired structures, compositions, and sizes on a large scale.








Abstract
Core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures have been receiving significant interest due to their potential in wide scientific and technological fields. Given such large scope, however, they still lag far behind in terms of the ambition toward controllably, or even programmatically, synthesizing libraries of core&#8211;shell structures on a large scale. Here, a general route for the programmable preparation of complex core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal (LM) droplets as reformable templates is presented, and the triggering of a localized galvanic replacement reaction in one ultrasonication system is demonstrated. Benefiting from the activity and mobility of the metal components in LM templates, high&#8208;level compositional diversity control and quantitative regulation of both the core and the shell layers of the heterogeneous products are achieved, which cannot be realized with a solid&#8208;template synthetic route.

&lt;p&gt;Core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures have been receiving significant interest due to their potential in wide scientific and technological fields. Given such large scope, however, they still lag far behind in terms of the ambition toward controllably, or even programmatically, synthesizing libraries of core&#8211;shell structures on a large scale. Here, a general route for the programmable preparation of complex core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal (LM) droplets as reformable templates is presented, and the triggering of a localized galvanic replacement reaction in one ultrasonication system is demonstrated. Benefiting from the activity and mobility of the metal components in LM templates, high&#8208;level compositional diversity control and quantitative regulation of both the core and the shell layers of the heterogeneous products are achieved, which cannot be realized with a solid&#8208;template synthetic route.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interfacial Atomistic Mechanisms of Lithium Metal Stripping and Plating in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery is a key research direction for next&#8208;generation batteries. Using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the detailed atomistic mechanism and interface failure of the lithium metal anode during lithium cycling are revealed. A guiding map and new strategies for the selection and improvement of solid interfaces in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are provided.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries based on a Li metal anode represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage system, but are currently limited by low current density and short cycle life. Further research to improve the Li metal anode is impeded by the lack of understanding in its failure mechanisms at lithium&#8211;solid interfaces, in particular, the fundamental atomistic processes responsible for interface failure. Here, using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the first atomistic modeling study of lithium stripping and plating on a solid electrolyte is performed by explicitly considering key fundamental atomistic processes and interface atomistic structures. In the simulations, the interface failure initiated with the formation of nano&#8208;sized pores, and how interface structures, lithium diffusion, adhesion energy, and applied pressure affect interface failure during Li cycling are observed. By systematically varying the parameters of solid&#8208;state lithium cells in the simulations, the parameter space of applied pressures and interfacial adhesion energies that inhibit interface failure during cycling are mapped to guide selection of solid&#8208;state cells. This study establishes the atomistic modeling for Li stripping and plating, and predicts optimal solid interfaces and new strategies for the future research and development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Control of Double Exchange Interaction in La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 for Ionic&#8211;Electric&#8211;Magnetic Coupled Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;incorporating La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 shows a reversible metal&#8211;insulator transition with tailored ferromagnetism owing to a modulation of the double exchange interaction. High reproducibility, long&#8208;term stability, and linear multilevel resistivity and magnetic moment are demonstrated, which are attractive for ionic&#8211;electric&#8211;magnetic coupled applications.








Abstract
The dynamic tuning of ion concentrations has attracted significant attention for creating versatile functionalities of materials, which are impossible to reach using classical control knobs. Despite these merits, the following fundamental questions remain: how do ions affect the electronic bandstructure, and how do ions simultaneously change the electrical and magnetic properties? Here, by annealing platinum&#8208;dotted La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 films in hydrogen and argon at a lower temperature of 200 &#176;C for several minutes, a reversible change in resistivity is achieved by three orders of magnitude with tailored ferromagnetic magnetization. The transition occurs through the tuning of the double exchange interaction, ascribed to an electron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced and/or a lattice&#8208;expansion&#8208;induced modulation, along with an increase in the hydrogen concentration. High reproducibility, long&#8208;term stability, and multilevel linearity are appealing for ionic&#8211;electric&#8211;magnetic coupled applications.

         <title>Stabilizing &#947;&#8208;MgH2 at Nanotwins in Mechanically Constrained Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during hydrogenation of suitably designed Mg nanoparticles is demonstrated. A formation mechanism is proposed and the primary degradation mechanism of the nanoparticles based on transmission electron microscopy is identified. The combined knowledge of both mechanisms is expected to enable cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based materials for dynamic plasmonics and hydrogen storage, as &#947;&#8208;MgH2 enhances dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen uptake and the metal/dielectric transition make the Mg/MgH2 system a prime candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage and dynamic plasmonics. However, high dehydrogenation temperatures and slow dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2. A nanoparticle (NP) design, where &#947;&#8208;MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of &#946;&#8208;MgH2 via (301)&#946; twinning. It is proposed that these twins nucleate &#947;&#8208;MgH2 nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen&#8208;storage materials with improved dehydrogenation. It is envisioned that a more general design of confined NPs utilizes the inherent volume expansion to reform &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during each rehydrogenation.

         <title>Remote Control of Time&#8208;Regulated Stretching of Ligand&#8208;Presenting Nanocoils In Situ Regulates the Cyclic Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials allowing unprecedented, remote, and cytocompatible control of in situ and time&#8208;regulated nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils, that independently modulate the ligand pitch in the  nanocoils, are presented. It is demonstrated that magnetic control of ligand nanostretching promotes cyclic adhesion and mechanotransduction of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitates their consequential differentiation.








Abstract
Native extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit cyclic nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligands to regulate complex cell&#8211;material interactions. Designing materials that allow cyclic control of changes in intrinsic ligand&#8208;presenting nanostructures in situ can emulate ECM dynamicity to regulate cellular adhesion. Unprecedented remote control of rapid, cyclic, and mechanical stretching (&#8220;ON&#8221;) and shrinking (&#8220;OFF&#8221;) of cell&#8208;adhesive RGD ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils on a material surface in five repeated cycles are reported, thereby independently increasing and decreasing ligand pitch in nanocoils, respectively, without modulating ligand&#8208;presenting surface area per nanocoil. It is demonstrated that cyclic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (ligand nanostretching) facilitates time&#8208;regulated integrin ligation, focal adhesion, spreading, YAP/TAZ mechanosensing, and differentiation of viable stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging reveals magnetic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (stretching) and &#8220;OFF&#8221; (shrinking) of the nanocoils inside animals. Versatile tuning of physical dimensions and elements of nanocoils by regulating electrodeposition conditions is also demonstrated. The study sheds novel insight into designing materials with connected ligand nanostructures that exhibit nanocoil&#8208;specific nano&#8208;spaced declustering, which is ineffective in nanowires, to facilitate cell adhesion. This unprecedented, independent, remote, and cytocompatible control of ligand nanopitch is promising for regulating the mechanosensing&#8208;mediated differentiation of stem cells in vivo.

         <title>Extreme&#8208;Angle Silicon Infrared Optics Enabled by Streamlined Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralarge field of view (178&#176;) diffraction&#8208;limited imaging is experimentally realized using only a single&#8208;chip planar element composed of silicon streamlined structures, with diffraction efficiency approaching 100% even at glancing incidence. These results are attributed to the isophase streamline optimization strategy for constructing streamlined structures with the ability of perfect wavefront generation and beyond the limit of insufficient phase sampling.








Abstract
Infrared optical systems are indispensable in almost all domains of society, but their performances are often restricted by bulky size, small field of view, large thermal sensitivity, high fabrication cost, etc. Here, based on the concept of catenary optics, a novel isophase streamline optimization approach is leveraged to design silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible metasurfaces with broadband, wide&#8208;angle, and high&#8208;efficiency performances, which breaks through the glass ceiling of traditional optical technologies. By using the truly local geometric phase, a maximum diffraction efficiency approaching 100% is obtained in ultrawide spectral and angular ranges. Somewhat surprising results are shown in that wide&#8208;angle diffraction&#8208;limited imaging and laser beam steering can be realized with a record field of view up to 178&#176;. This methodology is scalable to the entire optical band and other materials, enabling unprecedented compact infrared systems for surveillance, unmanned vehicles, medical science, etc.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Engineered Heterostructures in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, are reviewed in detail and the stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and possible strategies for using stacking engineering to tune the properties of 2D materials are outlined.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer blocks to form a 3D stack, with a precisely chosen sequence/angle, is the newest development for these materials. In this way, one can create &#8220;van der Waals heterostructures (HSs),&#8221; opening up a new realm of materials engineering and novel devices with designed functionalities. Herein, a detailed systematic review of transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, and stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors is presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized.

         <title>Programmable Design and Performance of Modular Magnetic Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic micromodules of customized shape and position assemble to form flexible microswimmers. Through educated design, swimming speed is optimized and the study of flocks of swimmers reveals new interactions between co&#8208;moving magnetic beaters at the low Reynolds number limit.








Abstract
Synthetic biomimetic microswimmers are promising agents for in vivo healthcare and important frameworks to advance the understanding of locomotion strategies and collective motion at the microscopic scale. Nevertheless, constructing these devices with design flexibility and in large numbers remains a challenge. Here, a step toward meeting this challenge is taken by assembling such swimmers via the programmed shape and arrangement of superparamagnetic micromodules. The method's capacity for design flexibility is demonstrated through the assembly of a variety of swimmer architectures. On their actuation, strokes characterized by a balance of viscous and magnetic forces are found in all cases, but swimmers formed from a series of size&#8208;graded triangular modules swim quicker than more traditional designs comprising a circular &#8220;head&#8221; and a slender tail. Linking performance to design, rules are extracted informing the construction of a second&#8208;generation swimmer with a short tail and an elongated head optimized for speed. Its fast locomotion is attributed to a stroke that better breaks beating symmetry and an ability to beat fully with flex at high frequencies. Finally, production at scale is demonstrated through the assembly and swimming of a flock of the triangle&#8208;based architectures to reveal four types of swimmer couplings.

Abstract
Monitoring of the human microbiome is an emerging area of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Here, the potential of different nanomaterials and nanobiosensing technologies is reviewed for the development of novel diagnostic devices for the detection and measurement of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. Moreover, the current and future landscape of microbiome&#8208;based diagnostics is defined by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of current nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches, especially in the context of developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices that would meet the international guidelines known as REASSURED (Real&#8208;time connectivity; Ease of specimen collection; Affordability; Sensitivity; Specificity; User&#8208;friendliness; Rapid &amp; robust operation; Equipment&#8208;free; and Deliverability). Finally, the strategies of the latest international scientific consortia working in this field are analyzed, the current microbiome diagnostics market are reported and the principal ethical, legal, and societal issues related to microbiome R&amp;D and innovation are discussed.

         <title>In Vitro Mineralization of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vitro mineralization of collagen deals with the mechanisms of bone formation and the synthesis of tissue engineering scaffolds. Due to their biological relevance, the extra&#8208; and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. A general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed.








Abstract
Collagen mineralization is a biological process in many skeletal elements in the animal kingdom. Examples of these collagen&#8208;based skeletons are the siliceous spicules of glass sponges or the intrafibrillar hydroxyapatite platelets in vertebrates. The mineralization of collagen in vitro has gained interest for two reasons: understanding the processes behind bone formation and the synthesis of scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this paper, the efforts toward collagen mineralization in vitro are reviewed. First, general introduction toward collagen type I, the main component of the extracellular matrix in animals, is provided, followed by a brief overview of collagenous skeletons. Then, the in vitro mineralization of collagen is critically reviewed. Due to their biological abundance, hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. To a much lesser extent, also some efforts with other minerals are outlined. Combining all minerals and the suggested mechanisms for each mineral, a general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed. This review concludes with an outlook for further improvement of collagen&#8208;based tissue engineering scaffolds.

         <title>Reverse&#8208;Engineering Strain in Nanocrystallites by Tracking Trimerons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking the orbital molecule formation through the Verwey transition temperature (TV) in nanorods provides a unique window into nanocrystallite strain. Particles with uniaxial tensile strain show the highest TV = 150&#160;K reported to date.








Abstract
Although strain underpins the behavior of many transition&#8208;oxide&#8208;based magnetic nanomaterials, it is elusive to quantify. Since the formation of orbital molecules is sensitive to strain, a metal&#8211;insulator transition should be a window into nanocrystallite strain. Using three sizes of differently strained Fe3O4 polycrystalline nanorods, the impact of strain on the Verwey transition and the associated formation and dissolution processes of quasiparticle trimerons is tracked. In 40 and 50&#160;nm long nanorods, increasing isotropic strain results in Verwey transitions going from TV &#8776; 60 K to 20&#160;K. By contrast, 700&#160;nm long nanorods with uniaxial strain along the (110) direction have TV &#8776; 150&#160;K&#8212;the highest value reported thus far. A metal&#8211;insulator transition, like TV in Fe3O4, can be used to determine the effective strain within nanocrystallites, thus providing new insights into nanoparticle properties and nanomagnetism.

&lt;p&gt;Tracking the orbital molecule formation through the Verwey transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) in nanorods provides a unique window into nanocrystallite strain. Particles with uniaxial tensile strain show the highest &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = 150&#160;K reported to date.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although strain underpins the behavior of many transition&#8208;oxide&#8208;based magnetic nanomaterials, it is elusive to quantify. Since the formation of orbital molecules is sensitive to strain, a metal&#8211;insulator transition should be a window into nanocrystallite strain. Using three sizes of differently strained Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; polycrystalline nanorods, the impact of strain on the Verwey transition and the associated formation and dissolution processes of quasiparticle trimerons is tracked. In 40 and 50&#160;nm long nanorods, increasing isotropic strain results in Verwey transitions going from &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 60 K to 20&#160;K. By contrast, 700&#160;nm long nanorods with uniaxial strain along the (110) direction have &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 150&#160;K&#8212;the highest value reported thus far. A metal&#8211;insulator transition, like &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be used to determine the effective strain within nanocrystallites, thus providing new insights into nanoparticle properties and nanomagnetism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Thermoregulating Separators Based on Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally self&#8208;regulating separators are designed and fabricated to enhance the safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) through a nanoscale incorporation route, whereby a phase&#8208;change material capable of thermal storage is encapsulated coaxially into polymeric nanofibers. Such an unusual separator can alleviate the internal heat accumulation and temperature rise inside LIBs even under abuse conditions.








Abstract
Safety issues in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have aroused great interest owing to their wide applications, from miniaturized devices to large&#8208;scale storage plants. Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of LIBs; they prevent direct electric contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ion transport. In this study, the first design is reported for a thermoregulating separator that responds to heat stimuli. The separator with a phase&#8208;change material (PCM) of paraffin wax encapsulated in hollow polyacrylonitrile nanofibers renders a wide range of enthalpy (0&#8211;135.3 J g&#8722;1), capable of alleviating the internal temperature rise of LIBs in a timely manner. Under abuse conditions, the generated heat in batteries stimulates the melting of the encapsulated PCM, which absorbs large amounts of heat without creating a significant rise in temperature. Experimental simulation of the inner short&#8208;circuit in prototype pouch cells through nail penetration demonstrates that the PCM&#8208;based separator can effectively suppress the temperature rise due to cell failure. Meanwhile, a cell penetrated by a nail promptly cools down to room temperature within 35 s, benefiting from the latent heat&#8208;storage of the unique PCM separator. The present design of separators featuring latent heat&#8208;storage provides effective strategies for overheat protection and enhanced safety of LIBs.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Incorporated Alloy Catalysts: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth alloys are emerging catalytic materials in the field of energy conversion. They have unique electronic structures and spatial characteristics. The families of all rare earth alloy catalytic materials are reviewed, focusing on their synthesis, properties, structure, and applications.








Abstract
To improve the performance of metallic catalysts, alloying provides an efficient methodology to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. As emerging functional materials, rare&#8208;earth metal compounds can integrate the unique orbital structure and catalytic behavior of rare earth elements into metallic materials. Such rare&#8208;earth containing alloy catalysts proffer an opportunity to tailor electronic properties, tune charged carrier transport, and synergize surface reactivity, which are expected to significantly improve the performance and stability of catalysis. Despite its significance, there are only few reviews on rare earth containing alloys or related topics. This review summarizes the composition, synthesis, and applications of rare earth containing alloys in the field of catalysis. Subsequent to comprehensively summarizing and constructively discussing the existing work, the challenges and possibilities of future research on rare&#8208;earth metal compound materials are evaluated.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Colors from Carbon Dots for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) change from orange to green is realized for the first time in carbon dots (CDs) for advanced dynamic information encryption. The TDPC arises from the dual phosphorescence centers of the CDs having different decay rates, which can be simultaneously activated by irradiating with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm).








Abstract
The development of phosphorescent materials with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPCs) is of considerable interest for application in advanced dynamic information encryption. In this study, TDPC is realized in carbon dots (CDs) synthesized by the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal treatment of levofloxacin. CD ink printed on paper (CD@paper) exhibits a change in phosphorescence color from orange to green, 1 s after irradiation with 395 nm light. However, when irradiated with wavelengths shorter or longer than 395 nm, the CD@paper exhibits only green or red phosphorescence, respectively. The red and green phosphorescence originates from the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state and high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state, respectively. When irradiated with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm wavelength), the two phosphorescent centers can be simultaneously activated, emitting red and green phosphorescence with different decay rates. The red and green phosphorescence merge into an orange phosphorescence initially, exhibiting the TDPC phenomenon. Based on the unusual phosphorescent properties of the CDs, a kind of multilevel, dynamic phosphorescence colored 3D code is designed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

A majority of traditional nanoparticles&#8217; complex and ambiguous chemical formulas stand in their way of clinical translation. A small&#8208;molecular&#8208;based sharp pH&#8208;responding fluorescent nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of various tumor models with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and long retention time is developed.

Abstract
Development of novel nanomaterials for disease theranostics represents an important direction in chemistry and precision medicine. Fluorescent molecular probes in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) show high promise because of their exceptional high detection sensitivity, resolution, and deep imaging depth. Here, a sharp pH&#8208;sensitive self&#8208;assembling cyclopeptide&#8208;dye, SIMM1000, as a smart nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of diseases in living animals, is reported. This small molecule assembled nanoprobe exhibits smart properties by responding to a sharp decrease of pH in the tumor microenvironment (pH 7.0 to 6.8), aggregating from small nanoprobe (80&#160;nm at pH 7.0) into large nanoparticles (&gt;500&#160;nm at pH 6.8) with &#8776;20&#8211;30 times enhanced fluorescence compared with the non&#8208;self&#8208;assembled CH&#8208;4T. It yields micrometer&#8208;scale resolution in blood vessel imaging and high contrast and resolution in bone and tumor imaging in mice. Because of its self&#8208;aggregation in acidic tumor microenvironments in situ, SIMM1000 exhibits high tumor accumulation and extremely long tumor retention (&gt;19 days), while being excretable from normal tissues and safe. This smart self&#8208;assembling small molecule strategy can shift the paradigm of designing new nanomaterials for molecular imaging and drug development.

         <title>A Wetting&#8208;Enabled&#8208;Transfer (WET) Strategy for Precise Surface Patterning of Organohydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general wetting&#8208;enabled transfer (WET) strategy is developed to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from microscale to macroscale. The surface&#8208;patterned organohydrogels show excellent solvent resistance and mechanical properties, and can act as a soft printing template to transfer intact and robust patterns on hydrogel surfaces.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate water and oil phases in a designable manner is of great significance in widespread fields from art paintings to materials science. However, achieving precise and stable surface patterns for two immiscible phases of water and oil remains a challenge. Herein, a general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is reported to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from the microscale to the macroscale. Locally differentiated wettability induces hydrophilic monomers and hydrophobic monomers from an emulsion system onto the wettability&#8208;matching regions of the prepatterned substrates, subsequently forming corresponding hydrogel and organogel patterns on the organohydrogel surface after in situ photopolymerization. The precision of the surface patterns can be controlled by optimizing the gel monomers, emulsion droplet size, and surface chemical composition of the prepatterned substrates.

     alt="A Wetting&#8208;Enabled&#8208;Transfer (WET) Strategy for Precise Surface Patterning of Organohydrogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general wetting&#8208;enabled transfer (WET) strategy is developed to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from microscale to macroscale. The surface&#8208;patterned organohydrogels show excellent solvent resistance and mechanical properties, and can act as a soft printing template to transfer intact and robust patterns on hydrogel surfaces.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to manipulate water and oil phases in a designable manner is of great significance in widespread fields from art paintings to materials science. However, achieving precise and stable surface patterns for two immiscible phases of water and oil remains a challenge. Herein, a general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is reported to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from the microscale to the macroscale. Locally differentiated wettability induces hydrophilic monomers and hydrophobic monomers from an emulsion system onto the wettability&#8208;matching regions of the prepatterned substrates, subsequently forming corresponding hydrogel and organogel patterns on the organohydrogel surface after in situ photopolymerization. The precision of the surface patterns can be controlled by optimizing the gel monomers, emulsion droplet size, and surface chemical composition of the prepatterned substrates. This finding may provide a feasible strategy for precisely patterning functional materials from two&#8208;immiscible&#8208;phase systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Spatial Control of Probiotic Bacteria in the Gastrointestinal Tract Assisted by Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful yet simple new approach for controlling the spatial distribution of probiotic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract using a composite biomagnetic material is presented. This approach enhances the retention and persistence of orally administered probiotics in the small intestine of mice, which has broader applications for advancing studies of the gut microbiome and the development of probiotic therapies.








Abstract
Engineered probiotics have the potential to diagnose and treat a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. However, these exogenous bacterial agents have limited ability to effectively colonize specific regions of the GI tract due to a lack of external control over their localization and persistence. Magnetic fields are well suited to providing such control, since they freely penetrate biological tissues. However, they are difficult to apply with sufficient strength to directly manipulate magnetically labeled cells in deep tissue such as the GI tract. Here, it is demonstrated that a composite biomagnetic material consisting of microscale magnetic particles and probiotic bacteria, when orally administered and combined with an externally applied magnetic field, enables the trapping and retention of probiotic bacteria within the GI tract of mice. This technology improves the ability of these probiotic agents to accumulate at specific locations and stably colonize without antibiotic treatment. By enhancing the ability of GI&#8208;targeted probiotics to be at the right place at the right time, cellular localization assisted by magnetic particles (CLAMP) adds external physical control to an important emerging class of microbial theranostics.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Induced Nano&#8208;Engineering of Strain, Bandgap, and Exciton Funneling in 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering of naturally&#8208;formed wrinkles in a WSe2 monolayer, with real&#8208;time investigation of nano&#8208;spectroscopic properties is demonstrated using hyperspectral adaptive tip&#8208;enhanced PL (a&#8208;TEPL) spectroscopy with &lt;15 nm spatial resolution. This nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering allows to tune the exciton dynamics and emission properties at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a systematic switching and modulation platform of the wrinkle emission is demonstrated.








Abstract
The tunability of the bandgap, absorption and emission energies, photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, exciton transport, and energy transfer in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers provides a new class of functions for a wide range of ultrathin photonic devices. Recent strain&#8208;engineering approaches have enabled to tune some of these properties, yet dynamic control at the nanoscale with real&#8208;time and &#8208;space characterizations remains a challenge. Here, a dynamic nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering of naturally&#8208;formed wrinkles in a WSe2 monolayer, with real&#8208;time investigation of nano&#8208;spectroscopic properties is demonstrated using hyperspectral adaptive tip&#8208;enhanced PL (a&#8208;TEPL) spectroscopy. First, nanoscale wrinkles are characterized through hyperspectral a&#8208;TEPL nano&#8208;imaging with &lt;15 nm spatial resolution, which reveals the modified nano&#8208;excitonic properties by the induced tensile strain at the wrinkle apex, for example, an increase in the quantum yield due to the exciton funneling, decrease in PL energy up to &#8776;10 meV, and a symmetry change in the TEPL spectra caused by the reconfigured electronic bandstructure. Then the local strain is dynamically engineered by pressing and releasing the wrinkle apex through an atomic force tip control. This nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering allows to tune the exciton dynamics and emission properties at the nanoscale in a reversible fashion. In addition, a systematic switching and modulation platform of the wrinkle emission is demonstrated, which provides a new strategy for robust, tunable, and ultracompact nano&#8208;optical sources in atomically thin&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Luminescent Erbium&#8208;Doped Silicon Thin Films for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon is demonstrated. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond (fs)&#8208;laser is applied to selectively irradiate Er/Si thin film and incorporate Er ions into the silicon matrix. The labels are realized by the single&#8208;step selective fs&#8208;laser writing of luminescent areas or addition of chemical etching and laser writing of non&#8208;luminescent holes over the initially recorded image.








Abstract
The never&#8208;ending struggle against counterfeit demands the constant development of security labels and their fabrication methods. This study demonstrates a novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond laser is applied to selectively irradiate a double&#8208;layered Er/Si thin film, which is accomplished by Er incorporation into a silicon matrix and silicon&#8208;layer crystallization. The study of laser&#8208;induced heating demonstrates that it creates optically active erbium centers in silicon, providing stable and enhanced photoluminescence at 1530 nm. Such a technique is utilized to create two types of anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The first type is realized by the single&#8208;step direct laser writing of luminescent areas and detected by optical microscopy as holes in the film forming the desired image. The second type, with a higher degree of security, is realized by adding other fabrication steps, including the chemical etching of the Er layer and laser writing of additional non&#8208;luminescent holes over an initially recorded image. During laser excitation at 525 nm of luminescent holes of the labels, a photoluminescent picture repeating desired data can be seen. The proposed labels are easily scalable and perspective for labeling of goods, securities, and luxury&#160;items.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Tin Anode for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal anode based on the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn redox couple at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode is reported. In contrast to severe Zn dendrites, Sn metal prefers isotropic crystal growth without dendrites, leading to superior performance in lifespan and areal capacity in Sn&#8211;I cells. The Sn anode represents a promising electrode candidate for metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) such as zinc&#8208;based ARFBs have attracted remarkable attention owing to their intrinsic high energy density. However, severe dendrite issues limit their efficiency and lifespan. Here an aqueous metal anode operating between Sn(OH)62&#8722; (stannate) and metal Sn is presented, providing a reversible four&#8208;electron transfer at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode. In strong contrast to severe Zn dendrites, the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn electrode shows smooth and dendrite&#8208;free morphology, which can be attributed to its intrinsic low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy anisotropy which facilitates isotropic crystal growth of Sn metal. By coupling with iodide/tri&#8208;iodide (I&#8722;/I3&#8722;), the static Sn&#8211;I cell demonstrates a stable cycling for 500 cycles (more than 2 months). In contrast, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn anode suffers from serious dendrites and lasts less than 45 cycles (190 h) in Zn&#8211;I cells. A stable continuous flow cycling of Sn&#8211;I cell achieves a Sn areal capacity of 73.07 mAh cm&#8722;2 at an average discharge voltage of 1.3 V for 350 h. The alkaline Sn electrode demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free morphology and superior performance in cycle life and areal capacity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn metal anodes, offering a promising metal anode for high&#8208;energy ARFBs and other metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers via the Atomic Sawtooth Au Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic sawtooth Au surface allows the anisotropic adsorption energy of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) clusters to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming a single&#8208;crystal TMdC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is further demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys.








Abstract
Growth of 2D van der Waals layered single&#8208;crystal (SC) films is highly desired not only to manifest the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials, but also to enable the development of unprecedented devices for industrial applications. While wafer&#8208;scale SC hexagonal boron nitride film has been successfully grown, an ideal growth platform for diatomic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) films has not been established to date. Here, the SC growth of TMdC monolayers on a centimeter scale via the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is reported. The atomic tooth&#8208;gullet surface is constructed by the one&#8208;step solidification of liquid gold, evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. The anisotropic adsorption energy of the TMdC cluster, confirmed by density&#8208;functional calculations, prevails at the periodic atomic&#8208;step edge to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming the SC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys. This strategy provides a general avenue for the SC growth of diatomic van der Waals heterostructures on a wafer scale, to further facilitate the applications of TMdCs in post&#8208;silicon technology.

         <title>Tunable Linearity of High&#8208;Performance Vertical Dual&#8208;Gate vdW Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical dual&#8208;gate van der Waals (vdW) phototransistors are fabricated based on the ambipolar WSe2. With the tunability of the opposite dual&#8208;gating, a linear photoresponse can be obtained with a high responsivity and low noise level, resulting in a high detectivity. The linear photoresponse with high performance of these phototransistors offers the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Layered 2D semiconductors have been widely exploited in photodetectors due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. To improve their performance, photogating, photoconductive, photovoltaic, photothermoelectric, and other effects have been used in phototransistors and photodiodes made with 2D semiconductors or hybrid structures. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired high responsivity and linear photoresponse simultaneously in a monopolar conduction channel or a p&#8211;n junction. Here, dual&#8208;channel conduction with ambipolar multilayer WSe2 is presented by employing the device concept of dual&#8208;gate phototransistor, where p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels are produced in the same semiconductor using opposite dual&#8208;gating. It is possible to tune the photoconductive gain using a vertical electric field, so that the gain is constant with respect to the light intensity&#8212;a linear photoresponse, with a high responsivity of &#8776;2.5 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. Additionally, the 1/f noise of the device is kept at a low level under the opposite dual&#8208;gating due to the reduction of current and carrier fluctuation, resulting in a high detectivity of &#8776;2 &#215; 1013 Jones in the linear photoresponse regime. The linear photoresponse and high performance of the dual&#8208;gate WSe2 phototransistor offer the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Electrically Tunable Singular Phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen Shifts in Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Thin&#8208;Film Coatings as Optical Absorbers</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen (G&#8211;H)&#160;shifts in the visible wavelengths using an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities are experimentally presented. By using the temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of transparent dielectric film and the structural phase&#8208;change properties of chalcogenide phase&#8208;change material, wide tunability in G&#8211;H&#160;shift at the singular phase of light is demonstrated.








Abstract
The change of the phase of light under the evolution of a nanomaterial with time is a promising new research direction. A phenomenon directly related to the sudden phase change of light is the Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen&#160;(G&#8211;H) shift, which describes the lateral beam displacement of the reflected light from the interface of two media when the angles of incidence are close to the total internal reflection angle or Brewster angle. Here, an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities to realize electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts at the singular phase of light in the visible wavelengths is reported. Reversible electrical tuning of phase and G&#8211;H shifts is experimentally demonstrated using a microheater integrated optical cavity consisting of a dielectric film on an absorbing substrate through a Joule heating mechanism. In particular, an enhanced G&#8211;H shift of 110 times of the operating wavelength at the Brewster angle of the thin&#8208;film cavity is reported. More importantly, electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts are demonstrated by exploiting the significant tunable phase change that occurs at the Brewster angles, due to the small temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of the dielectric film. Realizing efficient electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts with miniaturized heaters will extend the research scope of the G&#8211;H shift phenomenon and its applications.

         <title>A Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Food Real&#8208;Time Visual Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart color&#8208;variation evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework probe and smartphone&#8208;based portable device is designed for on&#8208;site inspection of food quality. The freshness of raw fish samples can be accurately and monitored in real time by the naked eye by the clearly distinguishable color transition from orange red to green.








Abstract
Due to increasing food&#8208;safety issues, exploiting efficient approaches for food quality assessment and instrumentation has attracted concerns worldwide. Herein, a smart evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed for real&#8208;time visual monitoring of food freshness. Via post&#8208;synthetic modification, a ratiometric fluorescent MOF probe is constructed by covalently coupling fluorescein 5&#8208;isothiocyanate (5&#8208;FITC) with NH2&#8208;rich lanthanide MOF. The probes exhibit a dual&#8208;emissive&#8208;responsive to biogenic amine, resulting in an increase in FITC emission along with a decrease in Eu3+ emission accompanied by a clear distinguishable color transition from orange red to green. After doping the probes on a flexible substrate, the obtained MOF composite film can be integrated with a smartphone&#8208;based portable platform easily. It is proved that this smart evaluation system can be used for on&#8208;site inspection of the freshness of raw fish samples. This work develops a fluorescent MOF&#8208;based smart evaluation system as a novel platform for application in food monitoring, which not only has enormous economic value but also holds great public health significance.

Single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide nanoparticles embedded in layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) are fabricated through in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions using the MOF as both a template and precursor. The CoPSe/NC anode holds a set of intrinsic merits relative to its counterparts of CoSe2 or CoPS, representing an ultrastable, high&#8208;rate, and high&#8208;energy anode material for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na+/K+ ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large&#8208;scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high&#8208;rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long&#8208;cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC&#8208;based Na&#8208;ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Na&#8208;ion full cells based on P&#8208;, Se&#8208;, or S&#8208;containing binary/ternary anodes to date.

PdRuIr ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles exhibit highly durable and active three&#8208;way catalyst performance. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy catalysts, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.








Abstract
Since 1970, people have been making every endeavor to reduce toxic emissions from automobiles. After the development of a three&#8208;way catalyst (TWC) that concurrently converts three harmful gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), Rh became an essential element in automobile technology because only Rh works efficiently for catalytic NOx reduction. However, due to the sharp price spike in 2007, numerous efforts have been made to replace Rh in TWCs. Nevertheless, Rh remains irreplaceable, and now, the price of Rh is increasing significantly again. Here, it is demonstrated that PdRuM ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit highly durable and active TWC performance, which will result in a significant reduction in catalyst cost compared to Rh. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy NPs, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.

         <title>Anomalous High&#8208;Temperature Superconductivity in YH6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel yttrium hexahydride YH6 is synthesized, an outstanding high&#8208;TC superconductor with critical temperature of 224&#8211;226&#160;K and unexpectedly large upper critical magnetic field &#8776;116&#8211;158 T. YH6 demonstrates high critical current density of &#8776;3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, which is above that of NbTi and YBCO. The study points to a possible additional nonconventional contribution to superconductivity in YH6.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;stabilized hydrides are a new rapidly growing class of high&#8208;temperature superconductors, which is believed to be described within the conventional phonon&#8208;mediated mechanism of coupling. Here, the synthesis of one of the best&#8208;known high&#8208;TC superconductors&#8212;yttrium hexahydride Im3&#175;m&#8208;YH6 is reported, which displays a superconducting transition at &#8776;224&#160;K at 166&#160;GPa. The extrapolated upper critical magnetic field Bc2(0)&#160;of YH6 is surprisingly high: 116&#8211;158&#160;T, which is 2&#8211;2.5 times larger than the calculated value. A pronounced shift of TC in yttrium deuteride YD6 with the isotope coefficient 0.4 supports the phonon&#8208;assisted superconductivity. Current&#8211;voltage measurements show that the critical current IC and its density JC may exceed 1.75&#160;A and 3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, respectively, which is higher than that of the commercial superconductors, such as NbTi and YBCO. The results of superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT) and anharmonic calculations, together with anomalously high critical magnetic field, suggest notable departures of the superconducting properties from the conventional Migdal&#8211;Eliashberg and Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theories, and presence of an additional mechanism of superconductivity.

         <title>Color of Copper/Copper Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat perfect single&#8208;crystal Cu films prepared by the atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy method realize the coherent propagation of an oxidation front and display full&#8208;color by controlling the oxide&#8208;layer thickness. More than 50% of the standard red/green/blue color space is covered. Laser&#8208;oxide lithography forming a microscale local oxide embedded in metal is introduced.








Abstract
Stochastic inhomogeneous oxidation is an inherent characteristic of copper (Cu), often hindering color tuning and bandgap engineering of oxides. Coherent control of the interface between metal and metal oxide remains unresolved. Coherent propagation of an oxidation front in single&#8208;crystal Cu thin film is demonstrated to achieve a full&#8208;color spectrum for Cu by precisely controlling its oxide&#8208;layer thickness. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free and atomically flat films prepared by atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy allow tailoring of the oxide layer with an abrupt interface via heat treatment with a suppressed temperature gradient. Color tuning of nearly full&#8208;color red/green/blue indices is realized by precise control of the oxide&#8208;layer thickness; the samples cover &#8776;50.4% of the standard red/green/blue color space. The color of copper/copper oxide is realized by the reconstruction of the quantitative yield color from the oxide &#8220;pigment&#8221; (complex dielectric functions of Cu2O) and light&#8208;layer interference (reflectance spectra obtained from the Fresnel equations) to produce structural color. Furthermore, laser&#8208;oxide lithography is demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;scale linewidth and depth through local phase transformation to oxides embedded in the metal, providing spacing necessary for semiconducting transport and optoelectronics functionality.

         <title>Stable Unbiased Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Overall Water Splitting Exceeding 3% Efficiency via Covalent Triazine Framework/Metal Oxide Hybrid Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed covalent triazine frameworks are conformably deposited on both photocathodes and photoanodes, successfully addressing the trade&#8208;off between stability and efficiency of photoelectrodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting. Coupling organic semiconductors with inorganic photoelectrodes could be a feasible means for practical photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems using oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes are highly attractive for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, despite decades&#8208;long efforts, it is still challenging to develop efficient and stable photoelectrodes for practical applications. Here, thin layers of covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;BTh) containing a bithiophene moiety are conformably deposited onto the surfaces of a Cu2O photocathode and a Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 photoanode via electropolymerization to construct new hybrid photoelectrodes, successfully addressing the efficiency and stability issues. The CTF&#8208;BTh possesses a suitable band structure to form favorable band edge alignment with each metal oxide, creating a p&#8211;n junction and a staggered type&#8208;II heterojunction with Cu2O and Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the as&#8208;fabricated hybrid photoelectrodes exhibit substantially increased PEC performances. Meanwhile, the CTF&#8208;BTh film also serves as an effective corrosion&#8208;resistant overlayer for both photoelectrodes to inhibit photocorrosion and enable long&#8208;term operation for 150 h with only &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent densities. Furthermore, a stand&#8208;alone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising CTF&#8208;BTh&#8208;coated photoelectrodes exhibits 3.70% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Even after continuous operation for 120 h, the efficiency can still retain at 3.24%.

&lt;p&gt;Rationally designed covalent triazine frameworks are conformably deposited on both photocathodes and photoanodes, successfully addressing the trade&#8208;off between stability and efficiency of photoelectrodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting. Coupling organic semiconductors with inorganic photoelectrodes could be a feasible means for practical photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems using oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes are highly attractive for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, despite decades&#8208;long efforts, it is still challenging to develop efficient and stable photoelectrodes for practical applications. Here, thin layers of covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;BTh) containing a bithiophene moiety are conformably deposited onto the surfaces of a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photocathode and a Mo&#8208;doped BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode via electropolymerization to construct new hybrid photoelectrodes, successfully addressing the efficiency and stability issues. The CTF&#8208;BTh possesses a suitable band structure to form favorable band edge alignment with each metal oxide, creating a p&#8211;n junction and a staggered type&#8208;II heterojunction with Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Mo&#8208;doped BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Thus, the as&#8208;fabricated hybrid photoelectrodes exhibit substantially increased PEC performances. Meanwhile, the CTF&#8208;BTh film also serves as an effective corrosion&#8208;resistant overlayer for both photoelectrodes to inhibit photocorrosion and enable long&#8208;term operation for 150 h with only &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent densities.

         <title>General Design Methodology for Organic Eutectic Electrolytes toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes is developed to enable highly concentrated eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density RFBs. Organic molecules containing carbonyl, nitroxyl radical, and methoxy groups are essential to achieve eutectic systems. Furthermore, over threefold enhancement in solubility is achieved for methoxy&#8208;modified ferrocene derivative, exhibiting good cycling stability and high energy density (188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1) at solvent&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
By virtue of strong molecular interactions, eutectic electrolytes provide highly concentrated redox&#8208;active materials without other auxiliary solvents, hence achieving high volumetric capacities and energy density for redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, it is critical to unveil the underlying mechanism in this system, which will be undoubtedly beneficial for their future research on high&#8208;energy storage systems. Herein, a general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes (OEEs) is developed, and it is found that molecules with specific functional groups such as carbonyl (C&#63742;O), nitroxyl radical (N&#63743;O&#8226;), and methoxy (OCH3) groups can coordinate with alkali metal fluorinated sulfonylimide salts (especially for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, TFSI), thereby forming OEEs. Molecular designs further demonstrate that the redox&#8208;inactive methoxy group functionalized ferrocene derivative maintains the liquid OEE at both reduced and oxidized states. Over threefold increase in solubility is obtained (2.8 m for ferrocene derivative OEE) and high actual discharge energy density of 188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1 (75% of the theoretical value) is achieved in the Li hybrid cell. The established mechanism presents new ways of designing desirable electrolytes through molecular interactions for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic RFBs.

         <title>Boosting Wide&#8208;Range Tunable Long&#8208;Afterglow in 1D Metal&#8211;Organic Halide Micro/Nanocrystals for Space/Time&#8208;Resolved Information Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow luminescence, which exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide properties across a wide color range, as well as space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow, are developed. They have great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and optical logic gates.








Abstract
Molecular afterglow materials with ultralong&#8208;lived excited states have attracted considerable interest owing to their promise for light&#8208;emitting devices, optical imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. However, the realization of ultralong afterglow emission in low&#8208;dimensional micro/nanostructures has remained an open challenge, limiting progress toward new&#8208;generation photonic applications. In this work, new types of mono/binuclear metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow properties, made possibly by the rational control over both ultralong&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, are developed. Interestingly, the mono/binuclear coordination complexes present excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence across a wide range (wavelength &gt; 150&#160;nm) with broad emission color differences from blue to yellow owing to the multiple long&#8208;lived excited states. The 1D binuclear metal&#8211;organic microrods further exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide and space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow emission properties, endowing them with great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and logic gates. Therefore, this work not only communicates the first example of wide&#8208;range tunable ultralong afterglow of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic micro/nanocrystals under ambient conditions but also provides a new route to achieve optical communications and photonic logic compilation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Photodetectors of 2D Materials from Ultraviolet to Terahertz Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main mechanisms and recent significant progress of 2D material photodetectors from ultraviolet to terahertz waves are summarized. The overestimated performance of 2D material photodetectors is revealed. Photodetectors of 2D materials are compared with conventional materials, and an EIW mechanism strategy is proposed to utilize the thinness advantage of 2D materials to develop excellent photodetectors.








Abstract
2D materials are considered to be the most promising materials for photodetectors due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Since the discovery of graphene, many photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. However, the low quantum efficiency, large noise, and slow response caused by the thinness of 2D materials limit their application in photodetectors. Here, recent progress on 2D material photodetectors is reviewed, covering the spectrum from ultraviolet to terahertz waves. First the interaction of 2D materials with light is analyzed in terms of optical physics. Then the present methods to improve the performance of 2D material photodetectors are summarized, such as defect engineering, p&#8211;n junctions and hybrid detectors, and the issue of serious overestimation of the performance in reported photodetectors based on 2D materials is discussed. Next, a comparison of 2D material photodetectors with traditional commercially available detectors shows that it is difficult to balance the current 2D material photodetectors with regard to having simultaneously both high sensitivity and fast response. Finally, a possible novel EIW mechanism is suggested to advance the performance of 2D material photodetectors in the future.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Operational Stability &gt;300 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals are prepared and are demonstrated to function as a stable, efficient red&#8208;emitting layer. With incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene), the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 further exhibits reduced deep defects of PbCs, increased exciton binding energy, and reduced longitudinal&#8208;optical phonon energy. Red&#8208;emitting perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 achieve both high external quantum efficiency and superior operational stability.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operational stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), especially red PeLEDs with only several hours typically, has always faced great challenges. Stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) are demonstrated for highly efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs through incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene) (PMA) in synthesizing the NCs. The PMA can chemically interact with PbI2 in the precursors via the coupling effect between O groups in PMA and Pb2+ to favor crystallization of stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Meanwhile, the cross&#8208;linked PMA significantly reduces the PbCs anti&#8208;site defect on the surface of the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Benefiting from the improved crystal phase quality, the photoluminescence quantum yield for &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs films remarkably increases from 34% to 89%. The corresponding red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 17.8% and superior operational stability with the lifetime, the time to half the initial electroluminescence intensity (T50) reaching 317 h at a constant current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

Meanwhile, the cross&#8208;linked PMA significantly reduces the Pb&lt;sub&gt;Cs&lt;/sub&gt; anti&#8208;site defect on the surface of the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs. Benefiting from the improved crystal phase quality, the photoluminescence quantum yield for &#946;&#8208;CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs films remarkably increases from 34% to 89%. The corresponding red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 17.8% and superior operational stability with the lifetime, the time to half the initial electroluminescence intensity (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) reaching 317 h at a constant current density of 30&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Graphene: A Disruptive Opportunity for COVID&#8208;19 and Future Pandemics?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present pandemic has motivated researchers with different backgrounds to fight against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Graphene&#8208;related materials present numerous benefits for new antiviral solutions. The interaction of graphene&#8208;related materials with viruses, their virucidal activity, and their possible use in antiviral coatings and sensing devices for fast and reliable detection are highlighted.








Abstract
The graphene revolution, which has taken place during the last 15 years, has represented a paradigm shift for science. The extraordinary properties possessed by this unique material have paved the road to a number of applications in materials science, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. Graphene&#8208;related materials (GRMs) are now produced in large scale and have found niche applications also in the biomedical technologies, defining new standards for drug delivery and biosensing. Such advances position GRMs as novel tools to fight against the current COVID&#8208;19 and future pandemics. In this regard, GRMs can play a major role in sensing, as an active component in antiviral surfaces or in virucidal formulations. Herein, the most promising strategies reported in the literature on the use of GRM&#8208;based materials against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and other types of viruses are showcased, with a strong focus on the impact of functionalization, deposition techniques, and integration into devices and surface coatings.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with Metallic Pyrochlore Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic pyrochlore oxide electrodes are&#160;introduced to create epitaxial&#160;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Further tuning through such an epitaxial stabilization process can lead to the orthorhombic phase being stable over an even larger thickness range.








Abstract
The synthesis of fully epitaxial ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films through the use of a conducting pyrochlore oxide electrode that acts as a structural and chemical template is reported. Such pyrochlores, exemplified by Pb2Ir2O7(PIO) and Bi2Ru2O7(BRO), exhibit metallic conductivity with room&#8208;temperature resistivity of &lt;1 m&#937; cm and are closely lattice matched to yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia substrates as well as the HZO layers grown on top of them. Evidence for epitaxy and domain formation is established with X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, which show that the c&#8208;axis of the HZO film is normal to the substrate surface. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the HZO film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Thermodynamic analyses reveal the role of epitaxial strain and surface energy in stabilizing the polar phase as well as its coexistence with the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase as a function of film thickness.

         <title>Stabilizing Fullerene for Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under Ultraviolet Preconditioning and Light Soaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 23% efficiency is achieved using a stabilized phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM):bathophenanthroline (Bphen) interlayer in SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, which can retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
It is crucial to make perovskite solar cells sustainable and have a stable operation under natural light soaking before they become commercially acceptable. Herein, a small amount of the small molecule bathophenanthroline (Bphen) is introduced into [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester and it is found that Bphen can stabilize the C60&#8208;cage well through formation of much more thermodynamically stable charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Such a strengthened complex is used as an interlayer at the in&#8208;light perovskite/SnO2 side to achieve a champion device with efficiency of 23.09% (certified 22.85%). Most importantly, the stability of the resulting devices can be close to meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standard under simulated UV preconditioning and light&#8208;soaking testing. They can retain over 95% and 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1100 h UV irradiation and 1000 h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Pseudosolvent Intercalator of Chitin: Self&#8208;Exfoliating into Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Thick Nanofibrils for Multifunctional Chitinous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process that can circumvent strong mechanical disintegration is developed to extract chitin nanofibrils. Having controllable thickness down to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, and high aspect ratio up to 103, these ribbon&#8208;like nanofibrils can act as new building blocks to fabricate high&#8208;performance structural materials, being applicable in optics, wearable electronics, and energy devices.








Abstract
Traditionally, energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming postmechanical disintegration processes are inevitable in extracting biopolymer nanofibrils from natural materials and thereby hinder their practical applications. Herein, a new, convenient, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient method for exfoliating nanofibrils (ChNFs) from various chitin sources via pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process is proposed. These self&#8208;exfoliated ChNFs possess controllable thickness from 2.2 to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, high aspect ratio up to 103 and customized surface chemistries. Particularly, compared with elementary nanofibrils, ChNFs with few molecular layers thick exhibit greater potential to construct high&#8208;performance structural materials, e.g., ductile nanopapers with large elongation up to 70.1% and toughness as high as 30.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, as well as soft hydrogels with typical nonlinear elasticity mimicking that of human&#8208;skin. The proposed self&#8208;exfoliation concept with unique advantages in the combination of high yield, energy efficiency, scalable productivity, less equipment requirements, and mild conditions opens up a door to extract biopolymer nanofibrils on an industrial scale. Moreover, the present modular ChNFs exfoliation will facilitate researchers to study the effect of thickness on the properties of nanofibrils and provide more insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of biopolymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Selective Release of Different Neurotransmitters Emulated by a p&#8211;i&#8211;n Junction Synaptic Transistor for Environment&#8208;Responsive Action Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor is fabricated to emulate the reconfigurability of a biological synapse that expresses complex emotions of attraction or aversion. It enables high&#8208;accuracy pattern recognition, and controls artificial muscle to move in different directions in response to different external stimuli. These properties can be important in designing complex neuromorphic systems.








Abstract
The design of the first p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor (JST) based on n&#8208;type TiO2 film covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and with a p&#8208;type P3HT/PEO nanowire (NW) on top. Except for basic synaptic functions that can be realized by a single neurotransmitter, the electronic device emulates the multiplexed neurotransmission of different neurotransmissions, i.e., glutamate and acetylcholine, for fast switching between short&#8208; and long&#8208;term plasticity (STP and LTP). This is realized by the special p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction with hole transport in the p&#8208;type P3HT NW to form STP, and electron transport in the n&#8208;type TiO2 layer and trapped under the PMMA inversion layer to form LTP. Altering the external input induces changes of the polarity of the charge carriers in the conductive channel, promoting fast switching between STP and LTP modes. When stimulated using two parallel inputs, the response of PMMA/TiO2 emulates the synergistic effect of taste and aroma on the control of food&#8208;intake in the brain. Because of the bipolarity, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n JST has excellent reconfigurability, which importantly is attributed to simulate the plasticity of synapses and to mimic how distinct types of gustatory receptor neurons respond to different concentrations of salt. The electronic device lays the technical foundation for the realization of the future complex artificial neural networks.

         <title>Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning are developed to provide adaptive rigid and soft interfaces for versatile applications. Integration of graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device with a gallium platform facilitates the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of the gallium, enabling accelerated rigid&#8211;soft transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of reconfigurable personal electronics shows the potential of this approach, which can significantly enhance the versatility of electronics.








Abstract
Electronics with tunable shape and stiffness can be applied in broad range of applications because their tunability allows their use in either rigid handheld form or soft wearable form, depending on needs. Previous research has enabled such reconfigurable electronics by integrating a thermally tunable gallium&#8208;based platform with flexible/stretchable electronics. However, supercooling phenomenon caused in the freezing process of gallium impedes reliable and rapid bidirectional rigid&#8211;soft conversion, limiting the full potential of this type of &#8220;transformative&#8221; electronics. Here, materials and electronics design strategies are reported to develop a transformative system with a gallium platform capable of fast reversible mechanical switching. In this electronic system, graphene is used as a catalyst to accelerate the heterogeneous nucleation of gallium to mitigate the degree of supercooling. Additionally, a flexible thermoelectric device is integrated as a means to provide active temperature control to further reduce the time for the solid&#8211;liquid transition of gallium. Analytical and experimental results establish the fundamentals for the design and optimized operation of transformative electronics for accelerated bidirectional transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a reconfigurable system, which can convert between rigid handheld electronics and a flexible wearable biosensor, demonstrates the potential of this design approach for highly versatile electronics that can support multiple applications.

         <title>Approaching Crystal Structure and High Electron Mobility in Conjugated Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer microwire crystals are obtained from solvated aggregates. The precise crystal packing and electronic structure in the polymer microwires are evaluated for understanding of the charge transport properties. Polymer crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208;2T exhibit higher electron mobilities of up to 5.58&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with a much lower hopping energy barrier compared with conventional thin&#8208;film transistors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers usually form crystallized and amorphous regions in the solid state simultaneously, making it difficult to accurately determine their precise microstructures. The lack of multiscale microstructures of conjugated polymers limits the fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in polymer&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, crystals of two typical conjugated polymers based on four&#8208;fluorinated benzodifurandione&#8208;based oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (F4BDOPV) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) motifs, respectively, are obtained by a controlled self&#8208;assembly process. The strong diffractivity of the polymer crystals brings an opportunity to determine the crystal structures by combining X&#8208;ray techniques and molecular simulations. The precise polymer packing structures are useful as initial models to evaluate the charge transport properties in the ordered and disordered phases. Compared to the spin&#8208;coated thin films, the highly oriented polymer chains in crystals endow higher mobilities with a lower hopping energy barrier. Microwire crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208; and NDI&#8208;based polymers exhibit high electron mobilities of up to 5.58 and 2.56&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the highest values in polymer crystals. This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biomimetic Systems with Synergetic Color and Shape Responses Based on Oblate Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems with synergetic color and shape responses based on oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are developed. The structural colored biomimetic systems possess a lot of unique properties, such as tunable color, reversible shape change, easy processing, and flexible patterning, making them applicable in various scenarios.








Abstract
Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.

Inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br is applied to prepare high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs). (Chloromethylene)&#8208;dimethylammonium chloride as an additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to favor high&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films. Through optimizing the perovskite film, interface, and electrode type, the efficiency of the ST&#8208;PSC reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively.








Abstract
Thanks to the tunable bandgap and excellent photoelectric characteristics, perovskites have been widely used in semitransparent solar cells (ST&#8208;SCs). Most works present unsatisfactory power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) through reducing the thickness of the perovskite films because there is a trade&#8208;off between PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT). As a consequence, most PCEs are less than 12% when the AVT is higher than 20% due to the limited voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc). Herein, a strategy of intermediate adduct (IMAT) engineering is developed to improve the film quality of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br, which is a challenging issue to limit its performance of efficiency and stability. A normal n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;structured PSC based on the optimal CsPbI2Br film delivers a PCE of 16.02% with excellent stability. Furthermore, through optimizing the electrode type and interface, the ST&#8208;PSC shows a high Voc larger than 1.2&#160;V and the PCE reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an AVT of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a CsPbI2Br ST&#8208;PSC, and it outperforms most of other types of perovskites.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistance without Mixed Valence in a Layered Phosphide Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A change of paradigm in a technologically important phenomenon, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), is introduced. Previously, it was believed that the CMR required ferromagnetic ordering and a structural distortion. EuCd2P2 has antiferromagnetic ordering and does not have a structural distortion or mixed valence, yet it exhibits the largest CMR known in a single crystal.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetoresistive responses are the backbone of spintronic technology, magnetic sensors, and hard drives. Among them, manganese oxides with a mixed valence and a cubic perovskite structure stand out due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). A double exchange interaction underlies the CMR in manganates, whereby charge transport is enhanced when the spins on neighboring Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are parallel. Prior efforts to find different materials or mechanisms for CMR resulted in a much smaller effect. Here an enormous CMR at low temperatures in EuCd2P2 without manganese, oxygen, mixed valence, or cubic perovskite structure is shown. EuCd2P2 has a layered trigonal lattice and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 11 K. The magnitude of CMR (104%) in as&#8208;grown crystals of EuCd2P2 rivals the magnitude in optimized thin films of manganates. The magnetization, transport, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray data suggest that strong magnetic fluctuations are responsible for this phenomenon. The realization of CMR at low temperatures without heterovalency leads to a new regime for materials and technologies related to antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>Multitasking MXene Inks Enable High&#8208;Performance Printable Microelectrochemical Energy Storage Devices for All&#8208;Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;flexible MXene&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic system is demonstrated on a single substrate through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, MXene&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries or micro&#8208;supercapacitors, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor, where the multitasking MXene is fully exploited as a high&#8208;capacitance electrode, a sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, a highly conducting current collector, a metal&#8208;free interconnector, and a conductive binder.








Abstract
The future of mankind holds great promise for things like the Internet of Things, personal health monitoring systems, and smart cities. To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large&#8208;scale manufacture of self&#8208;sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive&#8208;free high&#8208;capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal&#8208;free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as&#8208;prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm&#8722;2 and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60&#160;V. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154&#160;&#956;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an all&#8208;flexible self&#8208;powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35&#160;ms. Therefore, this multipurpose MXene ink opens a new avenue for powering future smart appliances.

         <title>Ductile Ag20S7Te3 with Excellent Shape&#8208;Conformability and High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) material, Ag20S7Te3, with high carrier mobility, low lattice thermal conductivity, and a maximum zT of 0.80 at 600 K is reported. The prototype hetero&#8208;shaped TE generator consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#956;W under a temperature difference of 70 K.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric (TE) generators (TEGs) can power the sensors used in safety monitoring systems of undersea oil pipelines, but their development is greatly limited by the lack of materials with both good shape&#8208;conformable ability and high TE performance. In this work, a new ductile inorganic TE material, Ag20S7Te3, with high TE performance is reported. At 300&#8211;600 K, Ag20S7Te3 crystallizes in a body&#8208;centered cubic structure, in which S and Te atoms randomly occupy the (0, 0, 1) site. Due to the smaller generalized stacking fault energy in the (101&#175;)[010] slip system, Ag20S7Te3 shows better ductility than Ag2S, yielding excellent shape&#8208;conformability. The high carrier mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity observed in Ag20S7Te3 result in a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 0.80 at 600 K, which is comparable with the best commercial Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys. The prototype TEG consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#181;W under the temperature difference of 70 K. This study creates a new route toward hetero&#8208;shaped TEG.

         <title>Optical Microfluidic Waveguides and Solution Lasers of Colloidal Semiconductor Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution of semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) colloidally synthesized and used as the gain medium in a capillary microfluidic waveguide yields record low optical gain threshold in solution. A Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is created between the metallized sidewalls of the ends of the microfluidic channel and optically pumped along the side of the waveguide to generate a single&#8208;mode output laser beam.








Abstract
The realization of high&#8208;quality lasers in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications, including biological and chemical sensors and flow cytometry, and the development of advanced lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip (LOC) devices. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is proposed and demonstrated using an on&#8208;chip cavity. CdSe/CdS@CdxZn1&#8722;xS core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell colloidal semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) dispersed in toluene are employed in the cavity created inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device using SiO2&#8208;protected Ag mirrors to achieve in&#8208;solution lasing. Lasing from such a microfluidic device having CQWs solution as a microfluidic gain medium is shown for the first time with a record&#8208;low optical gain threshold of 17.1 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; and lasing threshold of 68.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; among all solution&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. In addition, air&#8208;stable SiO2 protected Ag films are used and designed to form highly tunable and reflective mirrors required to attain a high&#8208;quality Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. These realized record&#8208;low thresholds emanate from the high&#8208;quality on&#8208;chip cavity together with the core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell CQWs having giant gain cross&#8208;section and slow Auger rates. This microfabricated CQW laser provides a compact and inexpensive coherent light source for microfluidics and integrated optics covering the visible spectral region.

         <title>A Biodegradable Secondary Battery and its Biodegradation Mechanism for Eco&#8208;Friendly Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The environmental issues caused by the disposal of an increasing amount of used batteries have become a great challenge. A material and design strategy for a fully biodegradable rechargeable battery to address this concern is reported. A novel material&#8208;selection guideline and design rule provide a viable demonstration of a non&#8208;toxic and eco&#8208;friendly battery, which decomposes via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation.








Abstract
The production of rechargeable batteries is rapidly expanding, and there are going to be new challenges in the near future about how the potential environmental impact caused by the disposal of the large volume of the used batteries can be minimized. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to address these concerns by applying biodegradable device technology. An eco&#8208;friendly and biodegradable sodium&#8208;ion secondary battery (SIB) is developed through extensive material screening followed by the synthesis of biodegradable electrodes and their seamless assembly with an unconventional biodegradable separator, electrolyte, and package. Each battery component decomposes in nature into non&#8208;toxic compounds or elements via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation, with all of the biodegradation products naturally abundant and eco&#8208;friendly. Detailed biodegradation mechanisms and toxicity influence of each component on living organisms are determined. In addition, this new SIB delivers performance comparable to that of conventional non&#8208;degradable SIBs. The strategy and findings suggest a novel eco&#8208;friendly biodegradable paradigm for large&#8208;scale rechargeable battery systems.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Dual&#8208;Band Nano&#8208;Electromechanical Valley&#8208;Hall Topological Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of valley&#8208;Hall topological metamaterial is experimentally demonstrated on an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical platform. Backscattering&#8208;immune transport and valley&#8208;momentum locking effect are experimentally observed in the fundamental (&#8776;60 MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120 MHz) frequency bands. These nano&#8208;electromechanical metamaterials enable very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and open the door to experimental exploration of nonlinear topological mechanics at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Suppression of undesired backscattering of very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency elastic signals has been considered as a grand challenge in integrated phononic circuits. Originating from condensed&#8208;matter physics, valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators provide an intriguing strategy to overcome this challenge. To date, phononic valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators have been demonstrated only in bulk acoustic and mechanical systems operating at relatively low frequencies. Here, an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical valley&#8208;Hall topological insulator operating in the very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency regime is experimentally realized. Valley kink states that are backscattering&#8208;immune against sharp bends and exhibit the &#8220;valley&#8208;momentum locking&#8221; effect simultaneously in the fundamental (&#8776;60&#160;MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120&#160;MHz) frequency bands are demonstrated. It is further shown that the propagation directions of these dual&#8208;band valley kink states are always locked to their valley pseudospins. The results not only enable various applications in very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and capacity, but also open the door to experimental exploration of mechanical nonlinearities, particularly those involving the fundamental and second&#8208;order frequencies, in topologically nontrivial nanostructures.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Change in Semiconductor by Ion&#8208;Adsorption at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;immersed Hall measurements are proposed to find direct evidence of ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Electron density&#8208;change by diffusion&#8208;driven ion dynamics occurs in a fully liquid&#8208;submerged device designed to monitor ion&#8208;specific dynamics in aqueous bulk phases. The ion&#8208;concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions are correlated with ion&#8208;adsorption rate, causing electric signal variations in the semiconductor.








Abstract
The change in electrical properties of electrodes by adsorption or desorption at interfaces is a well&#8208;known phenomenon required for signal production in electrically transduced sensing technologies. Furthermore, in terms of electrolyte&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (EIS) structure, several studies of energy conversion techniques focused on ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface have suggested that the electric signal is generated by ionovoltaic phenomena. However, finding substantial clues for the ion&#8208;adsorption phenomena in the EIS structure is still a difficult task because direct evidence for carrier accumulation in semiconductors by Coulomb interactions is insufficient. Here, a sophisticated Hall measurement system is demonstrated to quantitatively analyze accumulated electron density&#8208;change inside the semiconductor depending on the ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Also, an enhanced EIS&#8208;structured device is designed in an aqueous&#8208;soaked system that works with the ionovoltaic principle to monitor the ion&#8208;dynamics in liquid electrolyte media, interestingly confirming ion&#8208;concentration dependence and ion&#8208;specificity by generated peak voltages. This newly introduced peculiar method contributes to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the ionovoltaic phenomena in terms of carrier actions in the semiconductors and ionic behaviors in the aqueous&#8208;bulk phases, providing informative analysis about interfacial adsorptions that can expand the scope of ion&#8208;sensing platforms.

         <dc:description>
Various electrochemical energy storage devices use movable ions in either the electrolyte or the electrodes for energy storage. A deep&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;ion battery that uses movable ions in both the electrolyte and the electrodes is developed, which offers opportunities to break the capacity limit of conventional rocking&#8208;chair Li&#8208;ion batteries.

As the practical capacity of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) approaches the theoretical limit, which is determined by the rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture, a new cycling architecture with higher capacity is highly demanded for future development and electronic applications. Here, a deep&#8208;cycling architecture intrinsically with a higher theoretical capacity limit than conventional rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture is developed, by introducing a follow&#8208;up cycling process to contribute more capacity. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture makes full use of movable ions in both of the electrolyte and electrodes for energy storage, rather than in either the electrolyte or the electrodes. Taking LiMn2O4&#8208;mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB)/Li cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 57.7% more capacity is obtained. Moreover, the capacity retention is as high as 84.4% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture offers opportunities to break the theoretical capacity limit of conventional LIBs and makes high demands for new&#8208;type of cathode materials, which will promote the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

         <title>Exfoliation of Alpha&#8208;Germanium: A Covalent Diamond&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Germanium crystals are exfoliated using a wet ball&#8208;milling technique to produce &#945;&#8208;germanium nanolayers (&#945;&#8208;Ge NLs) in a process that is upscaled to gram production. The &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs can be redispersed using a shear&#8208;mixer, yielding very stable suspensions. Theoretical calculations predict a thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap of these NLs that is confirmed by electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy of &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs with different orientations.








Abstract
2D materials have opened a new field in materials science with outstanding scientific and technological impact. A largely explored route for the preparation of 2D materials is the exfoliation of layered crystals with weak forces between their layers. However, its application to covalent crystals remains elusive. Herein, a further step is taken by introducing the exfoliation of germanium, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor presenting a 3D diamond&#8208;like structure with strong covalent bonds. Pure &#945;&#8208;germanium is exfoliated following a simple one&#8208;step procedure assisted by wet ball&#8208;milling, allowing gram&#8208;scale fabrication of high&#8208;quality layers with large lateral dimensions and nanometer thicknesses. The generated flakes are thoroughly characterized by different techniques, giving evidence that the new 2D material exhibits bandgaps that depend on both the crystallographic direction and the number of layers. Besides potential technological applications, this work is also of interest for the search of 2D materials with new properties.

         <title>Tensegrity Metamaterials: Toward Failure&#8208;Resistant Engineering Systems through Delocalized Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is typically preceded by a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events, while large parts of the system do not experience critical loads. Breaking with this established paradigm, this study introduces the concept of delocalized deformation, enabling failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials via 3D tensegrity metamaterials.








Abstract
Failure of materials and structures is inherently linked to localized mechanisms, from shear banding in metals, to crack propagation in ceramics and collapse of space&#8208;trusses after buckling of individual struts. In lightweight structures, localized deformation causes catastrophic failure, limiting their application to small strain regimes. To ensure robustness under real&#8208;world nonlinear loading scenarios, overdesigned linear&#8208;elastic constructions are adopted. Here, the concept of delocalized deformation as a pathway to failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials is introduced. Space&#8208;tileable tensegrity metamaterials achieving delocalized deformation via the discontinuity of their compression members are presented. Unprecedented failure resistance is shown, with up to 25&#8208;fold enhancement in deformability and orders of magnitude increased energy absorption capability without failure over same&#8208;strength state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lattice architectures. This study provides important groundwork for design of superior engineering systems, from reusable impact protection systems to adaptive load&#8208;bearing structures.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogel Structures with Spatiotemporal Reconfigurability using Addressable and Tunable Voxels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating hyper&#8208;redundant miniaturized soft robots with multiple active degrees of freedom is challenging. Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created, demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels supports the mass production of SVAs.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.

Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Copper Tetrahydroxyquinone Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electrocatalysis at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of a 2D copper tetrahydroxyquinone conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (c&#8208;MOF) is studied in the CO2 reduction reaction. In the low overpotential range, the c&#8208;MOF catalyst delivers record values of turn&#8208;over number for CO formation and a negligible overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction. These findings open a new path for further advances in core electrochemical reactions.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for electrocatalysis; however, lack of electrical conductivity in the majority of existing MOFs limits their effective utilization in the field. Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)&#8208;based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu&#63743;THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu&#63743;THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140&#160;nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16&#160;mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of &#8776;173&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.45&#160;V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of &#8776;91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as &#8776;20.82 s&#8722;1. In the low overpotential range, the obtained CO formation current density is more than 35 and 25 times higher compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF and MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, respectively. The operando Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the existence of reduced Cu (Cu+) during CO2RR which reversibly returns to Cu2+ after the reaction. The outstanding CO2 catalytic functionality of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) can open a way toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated by Taimur Ahmed, Sumeet Walia, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004207. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image preprocessing in an imaging array and optoelectronic machine learning for pattern classification and image recognition through deploying artificial neural networks.

In article number 2007239, Byung Jin Cho, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong, and co&#8208;workers present a design strategy for transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning. Transformative electronics are built on a gallium platform interfaced with graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device (f&#8208;TED). The graphene works as a catalyst to mitigate the supercooling phenomenon in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of gallium, and the f&#8208;TED offers active temperature control to help accelerate the rigid&#8211;soft transformation of the overall system.

         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is the inevitable consequence of a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events. Breaking with this paradigm, in article number 2005647, Julian J. Rimoli, Lorenzo Valdevit, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel class of tensegrity metamaterials. By connecting isolated loops of compressive elements through a continuous tension network, these metamaterials delocalize deformation, demonstrating a pathway toward superior failure&#8208;resistant engineering systems.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Charge Separation Strategies in Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency greatly relies on effective charge separation. The recent progress of atomic&#8208;level strategies for promoting charge separation and migration in the bulk, on the surface, and both bulk and surface of a photocatalyst are highlighted and a guideline for the bottom&#8208;up design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts suggested.








Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis as a productive technology furnishes a prospective solution to environmental and renewable energy issues, but its efficiency greatly relies&#160;on the effective bulk and surface separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Exploitation of atomic&#8208;level strategies allows in&#8208;depth understanding on the related mechanisms and enables bottom&#8208;up precise design of photocatalysts, significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, the advances on atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies toward developing robust photocatalysts are highlighted, elucidating the fundamentals of charge separation and transfer processes and advanced probing techniques. The atomic&#8208;level bulk charge separation strategies, embodied by regulation of charge movement pathway and migration dynamic, boil&#160;down&#160;to shortening the charge diffusion distance to the atomic&#8208;scale, establishing atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels, and enhancing the charge separation driving force. Meanwhile, regulating the in&#8208;plane surface structure and spatial surface structure are summarized as atomic&#8208;level surface charge separation strategies. Moreover, collaborative strategies for simultaneous manipulation of bulk and surface photocharges are also introduced. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts are discussed on the basis of a thorough comprehension of atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies.

Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since the Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes but multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones.

Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SexSy cathodes, and mainly focusing on their structures, compositions, and synthetic strategies. Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs. Last, the remaining challenges and research orientations in this booming field are proposed, which are expected to motivate more insightful works.

         <title>Giant and Reversible Barocaloric Effect in Trinuclear Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant and robust barocaloric effect is demonstrated in a trinuclear Fe(II) complex that exhibits an abrupt spin&#8208;state transition with a negligible hysteresis. The pressure&#8208;dependent transition spans temperatures between 318 K at ambient pressure and 383 K at 2.6 kbar. The reversible entropy and temperature changes observed are among the highest reported for any caloric material thus far.








Abstract
A giant barocaloric effect (BCE) in a molecular material Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6 (FBT) is reported, where bntrz = 4&#8208;(benzyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and tcnset = 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;2&#8208;thioethylepropenide. The crystal structure of FBT contains a trinuclear transition metal complex that undergoes an abrupt spin&#8208;state switching between the state in which all three FeII centers are in the high&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 2) electronic configuration and the state in which all of them are in the low&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 0) configuration. Despite the strongly cooperative nature of the spin transition, it proceeds with a negligible hysteresis and a large volumetric change, suggesting that FBT should be a good candidate for producing a large BCE. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and calorimetry reveal that the material is highly susceptible to applied pressure, as the transition temperature spans the range from 318 at ambient pressure to 383 K at 2.6 kbar. Despite the large shift in the spin&#8208;transition temperature, its nonhysteretic character is maintained under applied pressure. Such behavior leads to a remarkably large and reversible BCE, characterized by an isothermal entropy change of 120 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and an adiabatic temperature change of 35 K, which are among the highest reversible values reported for any caloric material thus far.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film quality is a governing factor determining the performance of RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The RP film quality for fabricating high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is discussed. Evaluation index and influential factors of RP perovskite films are reviewed. Based on this, strategies to improve RP perovskite film quality are also proposed.








Abstract
In the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone unprecedented rapid development and become a promising candidate for a new&#8208;generation solar cell. Among various PSCs, typical 3D halide perovskite&#8208;based PSCs deliver the highest efficiency but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. By contrast, the low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite&#8208;based PSCs have recently raised increasing attention due to their superior stability. Yet, the efficiency of RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is still far from that of the 3D counterparts owing to the difficulty in fabricating high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. In pursuit of high&#8208;efficiency RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, it is critical to manipulate the film formation process to prepare high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. This review aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the high&#8208;quality RP&#8208;type perovskite film formation by investigating the influential factors. On this basis, several strategies to improve the RP perovskite film quality are proposed via summarizing the recent progress and efforts on the preparation of high&#8208;quality RP perovskite film. This review will provide useful guidelines for a better understanding of the crystallization and phase kinetics during RP perovskite film formation process and the design and development of high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, promoting the commercialization of PSC technology.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

         <title>Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.








Abstract
Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers.

     alt="Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers. Increased efficiency of the current&#8208;induced domain wall motion is a prerequisite for commercially viable racetrack devices. Here, significantly increased efficiency with substantially lower threshold current densities and enhanced domain wall velocities is demonstrated by the introduction of atomically thin 4d and 5d metal &#8220;dusting&#8221; layers at the interface between the lower magnetic layer of the racetrack (here cobalt) and platinum. The greatest efficiency is found for dusting layers of palladium and rhodium, just one monolayer thick, for which the domain wall's velocity is increased by up to a factor of 3.5. Remarkably, when the heavy metal layer is formed from the dusting layer material alone, the efficiency is rather reduced by an order of magnitude.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of Flexible Ultrathin All&#8208;in&#8208;One Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Highly Stretchable, Editable, and Customizable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale assembly strategy of flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure is developed. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure endows the ZIBs with high flexibility and electrochemical performance as well as the ability to be tailored and edited into desired shapes and structures. Furthermore, they can be integrated with solar cells into an energy harvesting and storage integrated system.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered to be a promising candidate for flexible energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. However, the scalable assembly of flexible ZIBs is still a challenge. Here, a scalable assembly strategy is developed to fabricate flexible ZIBs with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure by combining blade coating with a rolling assembly process. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one integrated structure can effectively avoid the relative displacement or detachment between neighboring components to ensure continuous and effective ion&#8208; and/or loading&#8208;transfer capacity under external deformation, resulting in excellent structural and electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs can be tailored and edited controllably into desired shapes and structures, further extending their editable, stretchable, and shape&#8208;customized functions. In addition, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs display the ability to integrate with perovskite solar cells to achieve an energy harvesting and storage integrated system. These enlighten a broad area of flexible ZIBs to be compatible with highly flexible and wearable electronics. The scaling&#8208;up assembly strategy provides a route to design other ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy storage devices with stretchable, editable, and customizable behaviors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineering Induced Anisotropic Crystallite Orientation and Maximized Carrier Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Microfiber&#8208;Based Organic Bioelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors are reported, which display unprecedentedly large figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#956;C*&#160;&#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) using highly ordered crystalline PEDOT:PSS microfibers with enhanced carrier mobility (12.9&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) owing to the highly anisotropic crystallite domain ordering along the fiber direction via uniaxial strain engineering in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization.








Abstract
Despite the importance of carrier mobility, recent research efforts have been mainly focused on the improvement of volumetric capacitance in order to maximize the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, &#956;C* (product of carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance), for high&#8208;performance organic electrochemical transistors. Herein, high&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors with unprecedentedly large &#956;C* using highly ordered crystalline poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) microfibers with very high carrier mobilities are reported. The strain engineering via uniaxial tension is employed in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization in the course of drying coagulated fibers, resulting in the permanent preferential alignment of crystalline PEDOT:PSS domains along the fiber direction, which is verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The resultant strain&#8208;engineered microfibers exhibit very high carrier mobility (12.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) and hole density (5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1020&#160;cm&#8722;3). Such advantageous electrical and electrochemical characteristics offer the benchmark parameter of &#956;C* over &#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest metric ever reported in the literature and can be beneficial for realizing a new class of substrate&#8208;free fibrillar and/or textile bioelectronics in the configuration of electrochemical transistors and/or electrochemical ion pumps.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major challenges, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments on rational structure design strategies, surface/interface engineering, industrial anode/cathode selection, and advanced in situ/operando characterizations toward deep understanding of the working mechanism of Si&#8208;based electrodes are reviewed. It is demonstrated that Si&#8208;based anodes are promising candidates in configurations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, Li&#8211;S batteries, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, and beyond.








Abstract
The increasing demand for higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries driven by advancements in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices necessitates the development of alternative anode materials with a specific capacity beyond that of traditional graphite anodes. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments made in the rational design of Si&#8208;based electrodes and their progression toward practical application are presented. First, a comprehensive overview of fundamental electrochemistry and selected critical challenges is given, including their large volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth, low initial Coulombic efficiency, low areal capacity, and safety issues. Second, the principles of potential solutions including nanoarchitectured construction, surface/interface engineering, novel binder and electrolyte design, and designing the whole electrode for stability are discussed in detail. Third, applications for Si&#8208;based anodes beyond LIBs are highlighted, specifically noting their promise in configurations of Li&#8211;S batteries and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Fourth, the electrochemical reaction process, structural evolution, and degradation mechanisms are systematically investigated by advanced in situ and operando characterizations. Finally, the future trends and perspectives with an emphasis on commercialization of Si&#8208;based electrodes are provided. Si&#8208;based anode materials will be key in helping keep up with the demands for higher energy density in the coming decades.

         <title>Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Using Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanoagents to Fight Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of monotherapy and combination therapy using anti&#8208;angiogenic agents for fighting cancer is presented. Traditional cancer anti&#8208;angiogenic monotherapy and its limitations are first summarized. Then anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors.

     alt="Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Using Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanoagents to Fight Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of monotherapy and combination therapy using anti&#8208;angiogenic agents for fighting cancer is presented. Traditional cancer anti&#8208;angiogenic monotherapy and its limitations are first summarized. Then anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors. However, these trials showed only modest clinical efficiency; moreover, anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy may induce acquired resistance to the drugs employed. Combining advanced drug delivery techniques (e.g., nanotechnology) or other therapeutic strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy) with anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy results in significantly synergistic effects and has opened a new horizon in fighting cancer. Herein, clinical difficulties in using traditional anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy are discussed. Then, several promising applications of anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents in monotherapies and combination therapies are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of anti&#8208;angiogenic cancer therapy are summarized. A useful introduction to anti&#8208;angiogenic strategies, which may significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, is thus provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Flexible Noncontact Sensing for Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible noncontact sensing based on a high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor is realized by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66 for human&#8211;machine interaction systems, which can achieve not only asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems, but also touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients.








Abstract
From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross&#8208;infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water&#8208;absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.

         <title>3D Printing of Transparent Spinel Ceramics with Transmittance Approaching the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully 3D printed with a high printing resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. Application of the printed ceramics for optical imaging and photocatalyst support is explored.








Abstract
3D printing of transparent ceramics has attracted great attention recently but faces the challenges of low transparency and low printing resolution. Herein, magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully fabricated using a stereolithography&#8208;based 3D printing method assisted by hot isostatic pressing and the critical factors governing the transparency are revealed. Various transparent spinel lenses and microlattices are printed at a high resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. The 3D printed spinel lens demonstrates fairly good optical imaging ability, and the printed spinel diamond microlattices as a transparent photocatalyst support for TiO2 significantly enhance its photocatalytic efficiency compared with its opaque counterparts. Compared with other 3D printed transparent materials such as silica glass or organic polymers, the printed spinel ceramics have the advantages of broad optical window, high hardness, excellent high&#8208;temperature stability, and chemical resistance and therefore, have great potential to be used in various optical lenses/windows and photocatalyst supports for application in harsh environments.

         <title>Robust Superamphiphilic Membrane with a Closed&#8208;Loop Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of biobased superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, this membrane shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Oil&#8208;spill remediation is an international environmental challenge, and superamphiphilic membranes, as a promising solution, have recently drawn lots of attention. However, the robustness of the conventional membrane design is less satisfying under severe conditions during practical applications. Additionally, it is unavoidable for the membranes to face a series of foulants in their practical working environment, for example, algae and sand. These foulants will block the membrane, which leads to a new economic and environmental problem in terms of waste management at the end of their life. To address the aforementioned challenges, a new generation of superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes (SAVER) to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, SAVER shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions in the polymer network. The ease with which biobased SAVER can be manufactured, used, recycled, and re&#8208;used without losing value points to new directions in designing a closed&#8208;loop superamphiphilic membrane life cycle.

         <title>A Multichannel Ca2+ Nanomodulator for Multilevel Mitochondrial Destruction&#8208;Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curcumin (CUR) and cisplatin (CDDP) co&#8208;incorporating multichannel calcium&#8208;ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) demonstrates enhanced anticancer efficacy owing to induced multilevel mitochondrial damage by Ca2+ overload, which is promoted by the degradation of amorphous calcium carbonate, the CUR&#8208;mediated Ca2+ metabolism, and the CDDP&#8208;augmented synergistic destruction of mitochondria, which can be visualized by both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.








Abstract
Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted nanoformulations for cancer theranostics are receiving increasing attention owing to their benefits of precise drug delivery, maximized therapeutic index, and reduced off&#8208;target side effects. Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co&#8208;incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy. After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria&#8208;targeted tumor inhibition. Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator. The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging&#8208;guided organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.








Abstract
Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold.

     alt="Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Colorful Efficient Moir&#233;&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; interference structure augments light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and folds sunlight into the perovskite layer. Besides, the sets of Moir&#233; diffracted light achieve &#8220;1 + 1&#160;=&#160;3&#8221; comparing to the single diffraction grating. Therefore, moir&#233; perovskite solar cell has been constructed by the commercial DVD disc, resulting in the champion efficiency up to 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x(MAPbBr3)x).








Abstract
Light harvesting is crucial for thin&#8208;film solar cells. To substantially reduce optical loss in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architectures enable absorption enhancement to exceed the conventional upper limit and have great potential for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the art optoelectronic performances. However, it remains a great challenge to design and fabricate a superior hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architecture, which exhibits extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting ability and simultaneously avoids deteriorating the electrical performance of PSCs. Herein, colorful efficient moir&#233;&#8208;PSCs are designed and fabricated incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by the imprinting method with the aid of a commercial DVD disc. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the light harvesting ability of the moir&#233; interference structure can be well manipulated through changing the rotation angle (0&#176;&#8211;90&#176;). The boosted short&#8208;circuit current is credited to augment light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and fold sunlight into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the imprinting process suppresses the trap sites and voids at the active&#8208;layer interfaces with eliminated hysteresis. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves the best enhancement of light harvesting (28.5% higher than the pristine), resulting in efficiencies over 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x (MAPbBr3)x).

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Wicking&#8211;Polarization&#8208;Induced Water Cluster Size Effect on Triboelectric Evaporation Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A textile that can couple active triboelectric polarization and passive wicking to break&#8208;up large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers is reported to promote sweat evaporation. This textile is a useful weapon for eliminating sweat produced by strenuous exercise, and it also shows broad application prospects in quick&#8208;drying sportswear, cooling fabrics and wireless sports monitoring insoles.








Abstract
Sweating during exercise, physical labor, or hot weather leads to a feeling of discomfort. The stuffiness, stickiness, and heaviness brought by sweat may promote negative emotions or disease. Clothing, textiles, and wearable devices exacerbate these problems by restricting evaporation of sweat. Here, a textile that can promote and enhance sweat evaporation by coupling wicking and polarization is reported. The wicking is produced by the wettability gradient and pore size, which make the surface moisture content of the textile in contact with the skin strictly 0%. The polarization is driven by a ferroelectric&#8208;enhanced triboelectric textile. This textile degrades large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers, so that the textiles have an excellent moisture evaporation rate (4.4 and 3.6 times faster than the cotton and polyester textiles, respectively). This work provides a new source of inspiration for quick&#8208;drying textiles and also finds an attractive application for triboelectric technology.

         <title>Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Selective Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Notable developments of SnO2 as an electron&#8208;selective layer for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are reviewed, along with an overview of the fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic and toxicology analyses of SnO2 are discussed for possible large&#8208;scale deployment of PSCs. Finally, the role of SnO2 in scaled module and tandem solar cell production is revealed.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, where the evolution of the electron&#8208;selective layers (ESLs), an integral part of any PV device, has played a distinctive role to their progress. To date, the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2)/compact TiO2 stack has been among the most used ESLs in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs. However, this material requires high&#8208;temperature sintering and may induce hysteresis under operational conditions, raising concerns about its use toward commercialization. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as an attractive alternative ESL, thanks to its wide bandgap, high optical transmission, high carrier mobility, suitable band alignment with perovskites, and decent chemical stability. Additionally, its low&#8208;temperature processability enables compatibility with temperature&#8208;sensitive substrates, and thus flexible devices and tandem solar cells. Here, the notable developments of SnO2 as a perovskite&#8208;relevant ESL are reviewed with emphasis placed on the various fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes toward champion solar cells with high stability. Further, a techno&#8208;economic analysis of SnO2 materials for large&#8208;scale deployment, together with a processing&#8208;toxicology assessment, is presented. Finally, a perspective on how SnO2 materials can be instrumental in successful large&#8208;scale module and perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cell manufacturing is provided.

         <title>A &#916;E&#160;= 0.63 V Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;E&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &#916;E of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (&#916;E = 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K.

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

         <title>Lithium Metal Electrode with Increased Air Stability and Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Realized by Silane Coupling Agent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Al&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 135.3 emu g&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), low coercivity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 127.3 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (H31) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending H31 with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;def:6,5,10&#8208;d&#8242;e&#8242;f&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL. Small&#8208;molecule donor&#8211;acceptor blends thus provide interesting perspectives for achieving efficient, reproducible, and stable device architectures without electrode interlayers.

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, an uttermost power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS2 to MoS2 part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&#8211;2 and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&#8211;2. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic&#8208;to&#8208;ionic power generation within angstrom&#8208;scale confinement anticipates potential for light&#8208;controlled ionic circuits, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic energy conversion.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films are fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field: A New Mechanism Promoting Mass Transfer in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanistic understanding of the enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is achieved by employing dense arrays of nanocones with sharp tips. A local electric field promotes aggregation of hydroxide ions  near the high&#8208;curvature active sites, leading to lower overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared to blunt cones.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) causes high power consumption for electrochemical water splitting. Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1&#8211;x alloy nanocones arrays (with &#8776;2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)2 layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high&#8208;curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assembled Vacuolated Coacervates Control Macromolecule Spatiotemporal Distribution to Provide a Stable Segregated Cell Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups can self&#8208;assemble into stable vacuolated coacervates under physiological conditions, driven by physical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) derived from the end groups of the hydrophilic shell, thus providing novel insights into the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of coacervate organelles.








Abstract
Membraneless coacervate compartments in the intracellular and pericellular space mediate critical cellular functions. Developing synthetic coacervates that emulate the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of these natural coacervates is challenging but highly desirable. Herein, a generalizable nanoparticle assembly (NPA) strategy is developed, which is applicable to interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups, to fabricate vacuolated coacervates. The obtained NPA coacervates contain stable internal vacuoles to provide segregated microcompartments, which can mediate the spatially heterogeneous distribution of diverse macromolecules via restricted diffusion. It is further shown that the vacuolated NPA coacervates can harbor and retain macromolecular medium supplements to regulate the functions of cells encapsulated in vacuoles. Furthermore, the restricted macromolecule diffusion can be abolished on demand via the triggered coacervate&#8211;hydrogel transition, thereby altering the exposure of encapsulated cells to environmental factors. It is believed that the NPA strategy provides new insights into the design principles of hierarchical coacervates that hold promising potential for a wide array of biomedical applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of the enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

&lt;p&gt;The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of the enzymatic activity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Revealing Structural Disorder in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon for a Low&#8208;Loss Photonic Platform at Visible Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bonding networks of hydrogenated amorphous silicon are revealed to reduce its optical loss in the visible region. Atomic bonding networks are manipulated by controlling the process conditions of plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The optimal atomic configuration demonstrates the low&#8208;loss hydrogenated amorphous silicon as being an efficient photonic platform by expanding the working frequencies from the infrared to the visible spectrum.








Abstract
The high refractive index of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) at optical frequencies is an essential property for the efficient modulation of the phase and amplitude of light. However, substantial optical loss represented by its high extinction coefficient prevents it from being utilized widely. Here, the bonding configurations of a&#8208;Si:H are investigated, in order to manipulate the extinction coefficient and produce a material that is competitive with conventional transparent materials, such as titanium dioxide and gallium nitride. This is achieved by controlling the hydrogenation and silicon disorder by adjusting the chemical deposition conditions. The extinction coefficient of the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H reaches a minimum of 0.082 at the wavelength of 450&#160;nm, which is lower than that of crystalline silicon (0.13). Beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces are demonstrated to validate the low&#8208;loss optical properties, reaching measured efficiencies of 42%, 62%, and 75% at the wavelengths of 450, 532, and 635&#160;nm, respectively. Considering its compatibility with mature complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor processes, the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H will provide a platform for efficient photonic operating in the full visible regime.

         <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese&#8208;based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials. The uniquely high catalytic activity and durability (over 5 months) of the latter precursors in alkaline media are attributed to its unexpected surface transformation into an amorphous MnOx phase with a birnessite&#8208;like short&#8208;range order and surface&#8208;stabilized MnIII sites under extended electrical bias, as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion by Interfacial Skew Scattering in Metallic Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terahertz emission spectroscopy is used to study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (S2C) in ferromagnetic (F)|nonmagnetic (N) bilayer metal thin films. The measurements indicate that S2C at the F/N interfaces can become comparable to the overall S2C and that the sign is drastically affected by interface modifications. A possible extrinsic S2C mechanism, skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interfacial imperfections, is suggested.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of spin to charge transport and vice versa is of major relevance for the detection and generation of spin currents in spin&#8208;based electronics. Interfaces of heterostructures are known to have a marked impact on this process. Here, terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy is used to study ultrafast spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion (S2C) in about 50 prototypical F|N bilayers consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F (e.g., Ni81Fe19, Co, or Fe) and a nonmagnetic layer N with strong (Pt) or weak (Cu and Al) spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Varying the structure of the F/N interface leads to a drastic change in the amplitude and even inversion of the polarity of the THz charge current. Remarkably, when N is a material with small spin Hall angle, a dominant interface contribution to the ultrafast charge current is found. Its magnitude amounts to as much as about 20% of that found in the F|Pt reference sample. Symmetry arguments and first&#8208;principles calculations strongly suggest that the interfacial S2C arises from skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interface imperfections. The results highlight the potential of skew scattering for interfacial S2C and propose a promising route to enhanced S2C by tailored interfaces at all frequencies from DC to terahertz.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Directional Polarized Light Emission from Thin&#8208;Film Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly directional and polarized light emission is demonstrated in thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) by suppressing the background emission and extracting only the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode. It is found that the TE waveguide mode increases with the refractive index of the emitting layer and a 2.6 times higher current efficiency is achieved in a perovskite LED.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with directional and polarized light emission have many photonic applications, and beam shaping of these devices is fundamentally challenging because they are Lambertian light sources. In this work, using organic and perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) for demonstrations, by selectively diffracting the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode while suppressing other optical modes in a nanostructured LED, the authors first demonstrate highly directional light emission from a full&#8208;area organic LED with a small divergence angle less than 3&#176; and a TE to transverse magnetic (TM) polarization extinction ratio of 13. The highly selective diffraction of only the TE waveguide mode is possible due to the planarization of the device stack by thermal evaporation and solution processing. Using this strategy, directional and polarized emission from a perovskite LED having a current efficiency 2.6 times compared to the reference planar device is further demonstrated. This large enhancement in efficiency in the PeLED is attributed to a larger contribution from the TE waveguide mode resulting from the high refractive index in perovskite materials.

         <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

         <title>Realizing an All&#8208;Round Hydrogel Electrolyte toward Environmentally Adaptive Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, ultralow freezing point, excellent mechanical properties, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability is constructed. It can effectively suppress the growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of parasitic side reactions, thereby enabling a high&#8208;performance flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery that can work normally in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next&#8208;generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective method is developed to construct an all&#8208;round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record&#8208;breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions. This work opens new opportunities for the development of hydrogel electrolytes.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. It is shown that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications.

     alt="Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. It is shown that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin&#8208;film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Fluorophore Photostability Enabled by Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophores are much more photostable on organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs) than on glass. On a glass substrate, fluorophores are photobleached almost immediately; highly photostable fluorophores, however, are observed on an OHM substrate. Fluorophore photobleaching lifetimes are lengthened up to four orders of magnitude with a 230&#8208;fold increase in photon count.








Abstract
The dynamics of photons in fluorescent molecules plays a key role in fluorescence imaging, optical sensing, organic photovoltaics, and displays. Photobleaching is an irreversible photodegradation process of fluorophores, representing a fundamental limitation in relevant optical applications. Chemical reagents are used to suppress the photobleaching rate but with exceptionally high specificity for each type of fluorophore. Here, using organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs), an optical platform to achieve unprecedented fluorophore photostability without any chemical specificity is demonstrated. A more than 500&#8208;fold lengthening of the photobleaching lifetime and a 230&#8208;fold increase in the total emitted photon counts are observed simultaneously. These exceptional improvements solely come from the low&#8208;loss hyperbolic dispersion of OHM films and the large resultant Purcell effect in the visible spectral range. The demonstrated OHM platform may open up a new paradigm in nanophotonics and organic plasmonics for super&#8208;resolution imaging and the engineering of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale.

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to those of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

         <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.

Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

         <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

         <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

         <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

         <title>Strong Chemical Interaction between Lithium Polysulfides and Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphosphazene for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Safety and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper can not only increase the electrochemical performance via strong chemical interaction between components, but also improves the safety of batteries due to the high and low temperature resistance property as well as the good flame&#8208;retardant characteristics of PPZ.








Abstract
The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and potential safety hazard caused by the burning of flammable organic electrolytes, sulfur cathode, and lithium anode seriously limit the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, a flame&#8208;retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li&#8211;S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as&#8208;obtained flame&#8208;retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as&#8208;obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame&#8208;retardant &#8220;vice&#8208;electrode,&#8221; which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li&#8211;S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ&#8208;based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer toward next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to a hemispherical support realizing imaging of the light distribution, indicating potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization: Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass is one of the most important materials for optical applications but it is difficult to shape on the microscale. In article number 2006341, Frederik Kotz and co&#8208;workers present two&#8208;photon polymerization of nanocomposites, which are subsequently converted to transparent fused silica glass. The cover shows a glass microtower fabricated by this process.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network Structures: Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004707, Joon Hak Oh, Jong&#8208;Beom Baek, and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of fused aromatic network structures with C5N basal plane stoichiometry. Thin films cast onto silicon dioxide substrates from the C5N solution exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinary high electron and hole mobilities in field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) devices, superior to the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping.

         <title>2D Materials: Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single graphene sheet is stacked on top of monolayer MoS2. The 2D heterostructure is buckled out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, inducing bending in both layers. In article number 2007269, Arend M. van der Zande, Pinshane Y. Huang, and co&#8208;workers study the impact of interfacial engineering on the tunability of the bending stiffness in 2D multilayers. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of any arbitrary 2D heterostructure.

         <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

         <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

         <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms have been designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points toward a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

         <title>RhSe2: A Superior 3D Electrocatalyst with Multiple Active Facets for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acid and Alkaline Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D structured transition metal sulfide, RhSe2, is synthesized, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials are a vital class of electrocatalys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large area, excellent activity, and facile fabrication. Theoretical caculations domenstrate, however, that only the edges of the 2D nanosheets act as active sites, while the much larger basal plane exhibits passive activity. Here, from a distinguishing perspective, RhSe2 is reported as a &#8220;3D&#8221; electrocatalyst for HER with top&#8208;class activity, synthesized by a facile solid&#8208;state method. Superior to 2D materials, multiple crystal facets of RhSe2 exhibit near&#8208;zero free energy change of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which guarantees high performance in most common morphologies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Rh atoms act as the active sites in acid, which enables the modified Kubas&#8208;mediated pathway, while the Se atoms act as the active sites in an alkaline medium. The overpotentials of HER activity of RhSe2 are measured to be 49.9 and 81.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively. This work paves the way to new transition metal chalcogenide catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Concentration Ti3+ in Porous Carbon&#8208;Doped TiO2 Nanosheets for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheet with controllable Ti3+ concentration is prepared by a reproducible bottom&#8208;up strategy. The optimal C&#8208;TiOx with high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ exhibits a NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, the highest compared with all previously reported TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic ammonia synthesis is exciting but quite challenging with a very moderate yield at present. One of the greatest challenges is to develop highly active centers in a photocatalyst for N2 reduction under ambient conditions. Herein, porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheets with high&#8208;concentration active sites of Ti3+ are presented, which are produced by layered Ti3SiC2 through a reproducible bottom&#8208;up approach. It is shown that the high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ sites are the major species for the significant increase in N2 photoreduction activity by the C&#8208;TiOx. Such bottom&#8208;up substitutional doping of C into TiO2 is responsible for both visible absorption and generation of Ti3+ concentration. Together with the porous nanosheets morphology and the loading of a Ru/RuO2 nanosized cocatalyst for enhanced charge separation and transfer, the optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 72.1% shows a high NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, which is the highest compared to all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts at present.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation is introduced as a versatile and facile method to synthesize redox flow battery electrodes with hierarchical microstructures unachievable via conventional manufacturing approaches. Flow cell studies reveal that the novel materials can outperform conventional carbon fiber electrodes owing to better mass transfer and higher surface area, demonstrating that this method may enable new classes of porous electrodes tailored for particular electrochemical flow technologies.








Abstract
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance&#8208;defining components in redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements&#8212;i.e., high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport&#8212;without sacrificing scalability or manufacturability. Here, non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration of scaffold&#8208;forming polyacrylonitrile to pore&#8208;forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies with two common redox species (i.e., all&#8208;vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large (&gt;50 &#181;m) macrovoids in the through&#8208;plane direction and smaller (&lt;5 &#181;m) pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

The recent advances in the nanomaterials used in viral studies are systematically summarized. Representative applications of nanomaterials to viral detection and tracking are described, highlighting the antiviral effects of nanomaterials based on three mechanisms: entry inhibitors, replication inhibitors, and host immunity enhancers. The current challenges and future opportunities in this promising field are also discussed.








Abstract
Viruses not only pose severe threats to public health, but also influence the development of society. Over the past decade, rapid advances have been seen in the application of nanomaterials to virus research. As an interdisciplinary field, nanotechnology offers powerful functions because the structures of nanomaterials are unique, with remarkable physicochemical properties and excellent biocompatibility. Nanomaterials have been developed for virus detection and tracking and for antiviral strategies, to better understand viruses and reduce viral infections, implying a bright future for this field. Herein, the recent advances are systematically summarized regarding the nanomaterials used in viral studies. Representative applications of nanomaterials to viral detection and tracking are described. The antiviral effects achieved with nanomaterials based on different mechanisms are also described, including entry inhibition, inhibition of viral replication, and immunological enhancement. The current challenges and future opportunities in this promising field are also discussed.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.
