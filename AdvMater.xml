         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters Based on Azepine&#8208;Decorated &#957;&#8208;DABNA for CIEy below 0.06</title>

Azepine&#8208;substituted &#957;&#8208;DABNA derivatives exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties owing to multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) effects. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use these emitters simultaneously satisfy high color purity, quantum efficiency, luminous efficacy, and device durability, surpassing those reported in previous studies. The azepine unit shows great potential for enhancing the performance of OLEDs based on MR materials.








Abstract
Ultrapure deep&#8208;blue emitters are in high demand for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although color coordinates serve as straightforward parameters for assessing color purity, precise control over the maximum wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum is necessary to optimize OLED performance, including luminance efficiency and luminous efficacy. Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising candidates for achieving ideal luminescence properties; consequently, a wide variety of MR frameworks have been developed. However, most of these emitters experience a wavelength displacement from the ideal color, which limits their practical applicability. Therefore, a molecular design that is compatible with MR emitters for modulating their energy levels and color output is particularly valuable. Here, it is demonstrated that the azepine donor unit induces an appropriate blue&#8208;shift in the emission maximum while maintaining efficient MR characteristics, including high photoluminescence quantum yield, narrow emission, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. OLEDs using newly developed MR emitters based on the &#957;&#8208;DABNA framework simultaneously exhibit a high quantum efficiency of &#8776;30%, luminous efficacy of &#8776;20&#160;lm W&#8722;1, exceptional color purity with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates as low as (0.14, 0.06), and notably high operational stability. These results demonstrate unprecedentedly high levels compared with those observed in previously reported deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Enabling Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Charged Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence in Organics by Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Visible light is a universal and user&#8208;friendly excitation source; however, its use to generate persistent luminescence (PersL) in materials remains a huge challenge. Herein, we apply the concept of intermolecular charge transfer (xCT) in typical host&#8211;guest molecular systems, which allows for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, thus enabling efficient charging of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) PersL in organics by visible light (425&#8211;700&#160;nm). Importantly, NIR PersL in organics occurs via the trapping of electrons from charge&#8208;transfer aggregates (CTAs) into constructed trap states with trap depths of 0.63&#8211;1.17&#160;eV, followed by the detrapping of these electrons by thermal stimulation, resulting in a unique light&#8208;storage effect and long&#8208;lasting emission up to 4.6&#160;h at room temperature. The xCT absorption range was modulated by changing the electron&#8208;donating ability of a series of acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based CTAs, and the organic PersL was tuned from 681 to 722&#160;nm. This study on xCT interaction&#8208;induced NIR PersL in organic materials provides a major step forward in understanding the underlying luminescence mechanism of organic semiconductors and these findings are expected to promote their applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and medical diagnosis.

         <title>Multicolor Inks of Black Phosphorus for Midwave&#8208;Infrared Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) based ink with a bulk bandgap of 0.33&#160;eV (&#955; = 3.7&#160;&#181;m) has recently been shown to be promising for large&#8208;area, high performance mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics. However, the development of multicolor bP inks expanding across the MWIR wavelength range has been challenging. Here we demonstrate a multicolor ink process based on bP with spectral emission tuned from 0.28&#160;eV (&#955; &#8764; 4.4&#160;&#181;m) to 0.8&#160;eV (&#955; &#8764; 1.5&#160;&#181;m). Specifically, through the reduction of bP particle size distribution (i.e., lateral dimension and thickness), the optical bandgap systematically blue&#8208;shifts, reaching up to 0.8&#160;eV. Conversely, alloying bP with arsenic (bP1&#8208;xAsx) induces a red&#8208;shift in the bandgap to 0.28&#160;eV. The ink processed films are passivated with an infrared&#8208;transparent epoxy for stable infrared emission in ambient air. Utilizing these multicolor bP&#8208;based inks as an infrared light source, a gas sensing system is demonstrated that selectively detects gases such as CO2 and CH4 whose absorption band varies around 4.3&#160;&#181;m and 3.3&#160;&#181;m, respectively. The presented ink formulation sets the stage for the advancement of multiplex MWIR optoelectronics, including spectrometers and spectral imaging using a low&#8208;cost material processing platform.

         <title>Neutral Cyanine: Ultra&#8208;Stable NIR&#8208;II Merocyanines for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Tumor&#8208;Targeted Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototheranostics using emission from the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window show significant potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Clinical imaging&#8208;used polymethine ionic indocyanine green (ICG) dye is widely adopted for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy research due to its exceptional photophysical properties. However, ICG has limitations such as poor photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), short&#8208;wavelength emission peak, and liver&#8208;targeting issues, which restrict its wider use. In this study, we transformed two ionic ICG derivatives into neutral merocyanines (mCy) to achieve much enhanced performance for NIR&#8208;II cancer phototheranostics. Initial designs of two ionic dyes showed similar drawbacks as ICG in terms of poor photostability and low photothermal performance. One of the modified neutral molecules, mCy890, shows significantly improved stability, an emission peak over 1000&#160;nm, and a high photothermal PCE of 51%, all considerably outperform ICG. In vivo studies demonstrated that nanoparticles of the mCy890 can effectively accumulate at the tumor sites for cancer photothermal therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This research provides valuable insights into the development of neutral merocyanines for enhanced cancer phototheranostics.

Abstract
Direct methane conversion to value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions with in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K9Na2Fe(H2O)2{[&#947;&#8208;SiW9O34Fe(H2O)]}2&#183;25H2O polyoxometalate (Fe&#8208;POM) with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment towards CH4 photooxidation. The Fe&#8208;POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH4 to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#956;mol gPOM&#8722;1 and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H2O)SiW11O39]5&#8722; with Fe(H2O) active site, [Fe2SiW10O38(OH)]214&#8208; and [P8W48O184Fe16(OH)28(H2O)4]20&#8722; with multi&#8208;nuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single&#8208;dispersion of Fe&#8208;POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single&#8208;cluster functionalized PCN with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#956;mol gPOM&#8722;1. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)4&#8722;Fe(H2O)2 can supply Fe = O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)4&#8722;Fea&#8722;Ot&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 intermediate, similar to that for CH4 oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of 1 &#8764; 2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well&#8208;defined model for in&#8208;depth mechanism research.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Touch Surfaces to Prevent Cross&#8208;Contamination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Infection diseases are a major threat to global public health, with nosocomial infections being of particular concern. In this context, antimicrobial coatings emerge as a promising prophylactic strategy to reduce the transmission of pathogens and control infections. Here, antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination are prepared by incorporating iodine&#8208;loaded UiO&#8208;66 microparticles into a potentially biodegradable polyurethane polymer (Baycusan&#174; eco E 1000). These covers incorporate MOF particles that serve as both storage reservoirs and delivery systems for the biocidal iodine. Under realistic touching conditions, the door handle covers completely inhibit the transmission of Gram&#8208;positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram&#8208;negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungi (Candida albicans). The covers remain effective even after undergoing multiple contamination cycles, after being cleaned, and when tinted to improve discretion and usability. Furthermore, as the release of iodine from the door handle covers follow hindered Fickian diffusion, their antimicrobial lifetime is calculated to be as long as approximately two years. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of our antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination, and underlines the efficacy of integrating MOFs into innovative technologies.

         <title>Tissue Ablation: Applications and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue ablation techniques have emerged as a critical component of modern medical practice and biomedical research, offering versatile solutions for treating various diseases and disorders. Percutaneous ablation is minimally invasive and offers numerous advantages over traditional surgery, such as shorter recovery times, reduced hospital stays, and decreased healthcare costs. Intra&#8208;procedural imaging during ablation also allows precise visualization of the treated tissue volume while minimizing injury to surrounding normal tissues, reducing the risk of complications. Here, we explore the mechanisms of tissue ablation and innovative energy delivery systems, highlighting recent advancements that have reshaped the landscape of clinical practice. We will also discuss current clinical challenges related to tissue ablation, underlining unmet clinical needs for more advanced material&#8208;based approaches to improve the delivery of energy and pharmacology&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Acoustic Metagrating Holograms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in&#8208;plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher&#8208;order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings have demonstrated an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL has remained limited to one&#8208;dimensional metagratings, unable to access two&#8208;dimensional (2D) holographic images in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) spaces. Here, we investigate the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces. Through our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate a series of acoustic metagrating holograms. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently. Our study introduces an additional dimension to modern holography design and metasurface wavefront manipulation.

         <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intuitive bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top scheme is devised to flexibly construct and manipulate high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian skin effects. Two nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to realize multi&#8208;polar skin effects and hybrid skin&#8208;topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency&#8208;selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. Such intriguing properties can boost advanced applications like selective filters and directional amplifiers.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non&#8208;Hermitian physics. It is established that 1D NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology. However, the topological origin behind the higher&#8208;dimensional NHSE remains unclear, which poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top scheme to construct high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent 1D NHSEs. Not only the elusive high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well&#8208;defined 1D spectral winding topologies, but also the high&#8208;dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the 1D counterparts. As examples, two 2D nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi&#8208;polar NHSEs and hybrid skin&#8208;topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency&#8208;selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high&#8208;dimensional NHSEs, which can boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Magnetic&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Semi&#8208;Convertible Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel constructed through a universal supramolecular&#8208;covalent strategy exhibits reversible responsive lubricating capability. The application of magnetic field induces disassembly of the magnetic responsive gelatin/Fe3O4&#8208;NH2 network in the hydrogel, while the covalent PVA network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. A sol layer appears/disappears on the hydrogel surface following the magnetic field On/Off.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired magnetic&#8208;responsive hydrogel is confined in exceedingly narrow spaces for soft robots and biomedicine in either gel state or magnetofluidic sol state. However, the motion of the gel state magnetic hydrogel will be inhibited in various irregular spaces due to the fixed shape and size and the sol&#8208;state magnetofluid gel may bring unpredictable residues in the confined narrow space. Inspired by the dynamic liquid lubricating mechanism of biological systems, novel magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel (MSCH) is developed through imbedding magnetic&#8208;responsive gelatin and amino&#8208;modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles network into the covalent network of polyvinyl alcohol, which can be switched between gel state and gel&#8211;sol state in response to magnetic stimuli. It can be attributed the disassembly of triple&#8208;helix structures of the gelatin under the action of the magnetic field, driven by force from the magnetic particles conjugated on the gelatin chain through electrostatic interactions, while the covalent network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. This leads to a sol layer on the MSCH surface enabling the MSCH to pass effectively through the confined channel or obstacle under magnetic field. The present MSCH will provide an alternative mode for magnetic field&#8208;related soft robots or actuators.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Versatile Fixed Cellular Materials for Multiple Target Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregates of cells undergo a fixation procedure to ensure devitalization and long&#8208;lasting maintenance of architectonic features, both for spheroids and fibers. Direct contact of fixed cellular materials with cells from the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system shows their immunomodulatory properties. In an in vivo wound model distinct immunomodulatory profiles are dependent on the administered dose.








Abstract
Therapeutic cells are usually administered as living agents, despite the risks of undesired cell migration and acquisition of unpredictable phenotypes. Additionally, most cell&#8208;based therapies rely on the administration of single cells, often associated with rapid in vivo clearance. 3D cellular materials may be useful to prolong the effect of cellular therapies and offer the possibility of creating structural volumetric constructs. Here, the manufacturing of shape&#8208;versatile fixed cell&#8208;based materials with immunomodulatory properties is reported. Living cell aggregates with different shapes (spheres and centimeter&#8208;long fibers) are fixed using a method compatible with maintenance of structural integrity, robustness, and flexibility of 3D constructs.&#160;The biological properties of living cells can be modulated before fixation, rendering&#160;an in vitro&#160;anti&#8208;inflammatory effect toward human macrophages, in line with a decreased activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) pathway that preponderantly correlated with the surface area of the materials. These findings are further corroborated in vivo in mouse skin wounds. Contact with fixed materials also reduces the proliferation of&#160;activated primary T lymphocytes, while promoting&#160;regulatory populations. The fixation of cellular constructs is proposed as a versatile phenotypic stabilization method that can be easily implemented to prepare immunomodulatory materials with therapeutic potential.

         <title>Active Passivation of Anion Vacancies in Antimony Selenide Film for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VSe is a kind of detrimental deep&#8208;level defect in Sb2Se3 thin films which induces serious carrier trapping. The effective passivation of defects is achieved by introducing trace amount of sulfur into Sb2Se3 film by transforming VSe to SSe. SSe defects are benign and do not trap charge carriers, thus improving the carrier lifetime and device performance.








Abstract
Binary antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a promising inorganic light&#8208;harvesting material with high stability, nontoxicity, and wide light harvesting capability. In this photovoltaic material, it has been recognized that deep energy level defects with large carrier capture cross section, such as VSe (selenium vacancy), lead to serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and in turn limit the achievable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2Se3 solar cells. Understanding the nature of deep&#8208;level defects and establishing effective method to eliminate the defects are vital to improving VOC. In this study, a novel directed defect passivation strategy is proposed to suppress the formation of VSe and maintain the composition and morphology of Sb2Se3 film. In particular, through systematic study on the evolution of defect properties, the pathway of defect passivation reaction is revealed. Owing to the inhibition of defect&#8208;assisted recombination, the VOC increases, resulting in an improvement of PCE from 7.69% to 8.90%, which is the highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared by thermal evaporation method with superstrate device configuration. This study proposes a new understanding of the nature of deep&#8208;level defects and enlightens the fabrication of high quality Sb2Se3 thin film for solar cell applications.

         <title>Thermal Runaway Mechanism in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode full&#8208;cells of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: The role of Multidirectional Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crosstalk, the exchange of chemical species between battery electrodes, significantly accelerates thermal runaway (TR) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). To date, the understanding of their main mechanisms has centered on single&#8208;directional crosstalk of oxygen (O2) gas from the cathode to the anode, underestimating the exothermic reactions during TR. However, the role of multidirectional crosstalk in steering additional exothermic reactions has yet to be elucidated due to the difficulties of correlative in situ analyses of full cells. Herein, we elucidate the way in which such crosstalk triggers self&#8208;amplifying feedback that dramatically exacerbates TR within enclosed full cells, by employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. Our findings reveal that ethylene (C2H4) gas generated at the anode promotes O2 evolution at the cathode. This O2 then returns to the anode, further promoting additional C2H4 formation and creating a self&#8208;amplifying loop, thereby intensifying TR. Furthermore, CO2, traditionally viewed as an extinguishing gas, engages in the crosstalk by interacting with lithium at the anode to form Li2CO3, thereby accelerating TR beyond prior expectations. These insights have led us to develop an anode coating that impedes the formation of C2H4 and O2, to effectively mitigate TR.

         <title>2D Hybrid Perovskites: From Static and Dynamic Structures to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How static and dynamic lattices define the optoelectronic properties and facilitate potential applications of 2D perovskites is detailed in this review. The static structure, including octahedral distortion and bond variations, dominates the fine band structure. The dynamic structure, such as lattice vibration and carrier&#8211;matter coupling, regulates carrier dynamics. They are jointly responsible for the resulting performance.








Abstract
2D perovskites have received great attention recently due to their structural tunability and environmental stability, making them highly promising candidates for various applications by breaking property bottlenecks that affect established materials. However, in 2D perovskites, the complicated interplay between organic spacers and inorganic slabs makes structural analysis challenging to interpret. A deeper understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship in these systems is urgently needed to enable high&#8208;performance tunable optoelectronic devices. Herein, this study examines how structural changes, from constant lattice distortion and variable structural evolution, modeled with both static and dynamic structural descriptors, affect macroscopic properties and ultimately device performance. The effect of chemical composition, crystallographic inhomogeneity, and mechanical&#8208;stress&#8208;induced static structural changes and corresponding electronic band variations is reported. In addition, the structure dynamics are described from the viewpoint of anharmonic vibrations, which impact electron&#8211;phonon coupling and the carriers&#8217; dynamic processes. Correlated carrier&#8211;matter interactions, known as polarons and acting on fine electronic structures, are then discussed. Finally, reliable guidelines to facilitate design to exploit structural features and rationally achieve breakthroughs in 2D perovskite applications are proposed. This review provides a global structural landscape of 2D perovskites, expected to promote the prosperity of these materials in emerging device applications.

         <title>Injectable 2D Material&#8208;Based Sensor Array for Minimally Invasive Neural Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene and MoS2&#8208;based implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array is developed, presenting a minimally invasive implantation process for neural monitoring apparatus. The sensor array is injected via syringe and air pressure through a small hole in the skull and spreads out to conformally cover the cortical surface. The sensors detect epileptic discharges and monitor intracranial temperature and pressure.








Abstract
Intracranial implants for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases have been developed over the past few decades. However, the platform of conventional implantable devices still relies on invasive probes and bulky sensors in conjunction with large&#8208;area craniotomy and provides only limited biometric information. Here, an implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array that can be injected through a small hole in the skull and inherently spread out for conformal contact with the cortical surface is reported. The injectable sensor array, composed of graphene multi&#8208;channel electrodes for neural recording and electrical stimulation and MoS2&#8208;based sensors for monitoring intracranial temperature and pressure, is designed based on a mesh structure whose elastic&#160;restoring&#160;force enables the contracted device to spread out. It is demonstrated that the sensor array injected into a rabbit's head can detect epileptic discharges on the surface of the cortex and mitigate it by electrical stimulation while monitoring both intracranial temperature and pressure. This method provides&#160;good&#160;potential&#160;for implanting a variety of functional devices via minimally invasive surgery.

         <title>A Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Flexible, Ultrathin, and Robust Solid Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible and scalable approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique for the preparation of thin solid electrolytes is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, providing a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, which contributes to a uniform Li deposition.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered as the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety batteries. To achieve high energy density in ASSLMBs, it is essential that the solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are lightweight, thin, and possess superior electrochemical stability. In this study, a feasible and scalable fabrication approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number of the SSE. This provides a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, promoting uniform Li deposition. As a result, based on the mechanically robust and thin SSEs, the Li symmetric cells show outstanding Li plating/stripping reversibility. Besides, a stable&#160;interface&#160;contact between SSE and Li anode has been established with the formation of an F&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interface layer. The solid&#8208;state Li|sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Li|SPAN) cell achieves a capacity retention ratio of 94.0% after 350 cycles at 0.5 C. Also, the high&#8208;voltage Li|LCO cell shows a capacity retention of 92.4% at 0.5 C after 500 cycles. This fabrication approach for SSEs is applicable for commercially large&#8208;scale production and application in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety ASSLMBs.

         <title>Counter&#8208;Doping Effect by Trivalent Cations in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent antimony is used to counter&#8208;dope the oxidized Sn&#8208;based perovskite by replacing divalent tin in the crystal lattice. It effectively decreases the doping levels in tin halide perovskites down to 1014 cm&#8722;3, and meanwhile passivates deep&#8208;level defects induced by iodine vacancies. The resultant devices show a relative enhancement of 31.4% in the average efficiency as well as improved shelf&#8208;storage stability.








Abstract
Tin (Sn) &#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) normally show low open circuit voltage due to serious carrier recombination in the devices, which can be attributed to the oxidation and the resultant high p&#8208;type doping of the perovskite active layers. Considering the grand challenge to completely prohibit the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites, a feasible way to improve the device performance is to counter&#8208;dope the oxidized Sn&#8208;based perovskites by replacing Sn2+ with trivalent cations in the crystal lattice, which however is rarely reported. Here, the introduction of Sb3+, which can effectively counter&#8208;dope the oxidized perovskite layer and improve the carrier lifetime, is presented. Meanwhile, Sb3+ can passivate deep&#8208;level defects and improve carrier mobility of the perovskite layer, which are all favorable for the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Consequently, the target devices yield a relative enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.4% as well as excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability. This work provides a novel strategy to improve the performance of Sn&#8208;based PSCs, which can be developed as a universal way to compensate for the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>2D Janus Polarization Functioned by Mechanical Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polarization materials are promising for miniaturized devices due to their unique properties. However, strategies for creating 2D polarization through new mechanisms are rare. This work introduces a 2D Janus structure with both vertical and planar polarization, achieved by applying force with a nanoprobe. This technique breaks symmetry at the atomic level, inducing polarization and paving the way for new 2D polarization materials' development and design.








Abstract
2D&#160;polarization materials have emerged as promising candidates for meeting the demands of device miniaturization, attributed to their unique electronic configurations and transport characteristics. Although the existing inherent and sliding mechanisms are increasingly investigated in recent years, strategies for inducing 2D polarization with innovative mechanisms remain rare. This study introduces a novel 2D Janus state by modulating the puckered structure. Combining scanning probe microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, this work realizes force&#8208;triggered out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dipoles with distorted smaller warping in GeSe. The Janus state is preserved after removing the external mechanical perturbation, which could be switched by modulating the sliding direction. This work offers a versatile method to break the space inversion symmetry in a 2D system to trigger polarization in the atomic scale, which may open an innovative insight into configuring novel 2D polarization materials.

         <title>Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two&#8208;terminal Perovskite&#8208;based Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;terminal (2T) perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) have aroused burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8208;Queisser (S&#8208;Q) limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8208;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, we present the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs. We also highlight the insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite&#8208;based two&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction TSCs. Finally, we summarize the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on.

         <title>Towards 1D Transport in 3D Materials: SOC&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transport Anisotropy in Sm3ZrBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, we&#160;demonstrate that spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi&#8208;1D charge transport in the Ln3MPn5 (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi&#8208;1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, we&#160;demonstrate that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8764;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8764;9.5 and &#8764;22 (&#8764;32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin&#8208;orbit coupling to induce quasi&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Volumetric Desalination Capacity Using Compact MoS2 Nanolaminates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low&#8208;salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, we report a high&#8208;density semi&#8208;metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieved high capacitance up to &#8764;277.5 F cm&#8722;3 under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV s&#8722;1 with a lower charge&#8208;transfer resistance and nearly ten&#8208;fold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrode. Furthermore, 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 electrode demonstrates exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1 mgNaCl cm&#8722;3 in CDI experiments. Ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption. Overall, this work provides a new method to design compact two&#8208;dimensional layered nanolaminates with high volumetric performance for CDI desalination.

         <title>Mott&#8208;Schottky Construction Boosted Plasmon Thermal and Electronic Effects on the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH Nanohybrids for Highly&#8208;efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mott&#8208;Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly&#8208;efficient and closely&#8208;linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott&#8208;Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well&#8208;designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it was found that the Mott&#8208;Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV&#8208;LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d&#8208;band center (from &#8208;0.89 to &#8208;0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31&#160;eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70&#215;1020 to 1.64&#215;1020 cm&#8722;3), lower the activation energy of OER (from 30.3 to 17.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Benefiting from these favorable factors, the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G NHs show remarkable electrocatalytic performances, with an overpotential of 178 and 263&#160;mV to afford 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and a low cell voltage of 1.42&#160;V to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation.

         <title>In&#8208;situ ions Induced Formation of KxF&#8208;rich SEI Layers towards Ultra&#8208;Stable life of Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering F&#8208;rich SEI layers is regarded as an effective strategy to enable the long&#8208;term cycling stability of potassium ion batteries (KIBs). However, in the conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolytes, it is challenging to form F&#8208;containing SEI layers due to the inability of KPF6 to decompose into KxF. Herein, AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to change the chemical environment of the KPF6 carbonate electrolyte. Firstly, due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. In addition, AlCl3 also reacts with trace H2O or solvents in the electrolytes to form Al2O3, which can further act as an HF scavenger. The &#8220;self&#8208;induced formation&#8221; of F&#8208;rich SEI layers (KxF and AlF3) and &#8220;self&#8208;elimination&#8221; of unexpected species (H2O and HF) guarantee the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability of KIBs. Upon incorporating AlCl3 into conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) anode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of &#8764;100%. When coupled with PTCDA, the full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81% after 360 cycles&#8208;significantly outperforming cells using conventional electrolytes. Moreover, PTCDA||HC pouch cell using AlCl3 added KPF6 electrolyte deliver a reversible capacity of 93 mAh g&#8722;1 with capacity retention of 86% after 80 cycles. This research paves new avenues for advancing electrolyte engineering towards developing durable batteries tailored for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

Herein, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is employed as a novel additive to change the chemical environment of the KPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; carbonate electrolyte. Firstly, due to the large charge-to-radius ratio of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, the Al-containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and accelerate the formation of K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;F in SEI layer. In addition, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also reacts with trace H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or solvents in the electrolytes to form Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which can further act as an HF scavenger. The &#8220;self-induced formation&#8221; of F-rich SEI layers (K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;F and AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and &#8220;self-elimination&#8221; of unexpected species (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF) guarantee the excellent long-term cycling stability of KIBs. Upon incorporating AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into conventional KPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; carbonate electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) anode exhibits an ultra-long lifespan of 10000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of &#8764;100%. When coupled with PTCDA, the full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81% after 360 cycles-significantly outperforming cells using conventional electrolytes. Moreover, PTCDA||HC pouch cell using AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; added KPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte deliver a reversible capacity of 93 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with capacity retention of 86% after 80 cycles. This research paves new avenues for advancing electrolyte engineering towards developing durable batteries tailored for large-scale energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Larger Dipole Moments for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Excellent Stability</title>

Abstract
In the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the wettability, adsorbability, and compactness of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on conductive substrates have critical impacts on the quality of the perovskite films and the defects at the buried perovskite&#8208;substrate interface, which control the efficiency and stability of the devices. Herein, we designed and synthesized three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs, IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3, by modulating the position of the two nitrogen atoms of the IDCz unit to improve the molecular dipole moments and strengthen the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Regulating the work functions (WF) of FTO electrodes through molecular dipole moments and energy levels, the perovskite band bends upwards with a small offset for ITO/IDCz&#8208;3/perovskite, thereby promoting hole extraction and blocking electrons. As a result, the inverted PSC employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibits a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for the multipodal SAMs&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with IDCz&#8208;3 can be stored for at least 1,800 hours with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite Nanograin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes in Green&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Gamut with co&#8208;Additive Engineering</title>

Abstract
Perovskite nanograins exceeding the Bohr exciton diameter show great potential for high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their bandgap homogeneity, spatial charge confinement, and nonlocal interaction. However, it is challenging to directly synthesize proper nanograins along with reduced crystal defects on functional substrate, and the corresponding high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) have rarely been reported. In this study, we perform crystallization modulation for perovskites with an effective co&#8208;additive system, including lithium bromide, p&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide, and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed co&#8208;additive system could synergistically retard perovskite crystallization and reduce crystal defects. Consequently, high&#8208;quality perovskite nanograin solids (&#8764; 22.8&#160;nm) are obtained with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8764; 88%). These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co&#8208;additive system can be universally applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. Our results supplement the research on high&#8208;efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.

         <title>Multiscale Heterogeneous Polymer Composites for High Stiffness 4D Printed Electrically Controllable Multifunctional Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled stiff morphing structures are built by 4D printing new multiscale polymer composites. Enabling the fabrication of active 3D autonomous structures, capable of self&#8208;sensing actuation, unprecedented levels of actuation stress, and specific mass while undergoing shape change. Integrating these materials with lattice designs enables large scale complex 3D surfaces that are loadbearing, culminating in a crawling multigait robotic lattice.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging field where 3D printing techniques are used to pattern stimuli&#8208;responsive materials to create morphing structures, with time serving as the fourth dimension. However, current materials utilized for 4D printing are typically soft, exhibiting an elastic modulus (E) range of 10&#8722;4 to 10&#160;MPa during shape change. This restricts the scalability, actuation stress, and load&#8208;bearing capabilities of the resulting structures. To overcome these limitations, multiscale heterogeneous polymer composites are introduced as a novel category of stiff, thermally responsive 4D printed materials. These inks exhibit an E that is four orders of magnitude greater than that of existing 4D printed materials and offer tunable electrical conductivities for simultaneous Joule heating actuation and self&#8208;sensing capabilities. Utilizing electrically controllable bilayers as building blocks, a flat geometry is designed and printed that morphs into a 3D self&#8208;standing lifting robot, setting new records for weight&#8208;normalized load lifted and actuation stress when compared to other 3D printed actuators. Furthermore, the ink palette is employed to create and print planar lattice structures that transform into various self&#8208;supporting complex 3D shapes. These contributions are integrated into a 4D printed electrically controlled multigait crawling robotic lattice structure that can carry 144 times its own weight.

         <title>Room Temperature Reduction of Nitrogen Oxide on Iron Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nitrogen oxides represent one of the main threats for the environment. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, a sustainable solution for NOx removal under environmental conditions is still undefined. Using theoretical modelling, material design, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art investigation methods and mimicking enzymes, we have found that selected porous hybrid iron(II/III) based MOF material are able to decompose NOx, at room temperature, in the presence of water and oxygen, into N2 and O2 and without reducing agents. This paves the way to the development of new highly sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to improve air quality.

Abstract
Revascularization after rotator cuff repair is crucial for tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing. The chirality of materials has been reported to influence their performance in tissue repair. However, data on the use of chiral structures to optimize biomaterials as a revascularization strategy remain scarce. Here, we develop calcium silicate hydrate (CSO) films with hierarchical chirality on the atomic to micrometer scale. Interestingly, levorotatory CSO (L&#8208;CSO) films promote the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, whereas dextral and racemic CSO films do not induce the same effect. Molecular analysis demonstrate that L&#8208;chirality can be recognized by integrin receptors and lead to the formation of focal adhesion, which activates mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 to conduct Ca2+ influx. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serum response factor is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis. After implanted in a rat rotator cuff tear model, L&#8208;CSO films strongly enhance vascularization at the enthesis, promoting collagen maturation, increasing bone and fibrocartilage formation, and eventually improving the biomechanical strength. This study reveals the mechanism through which chirality influences angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provides a critical theoretical foundation for the clinical application of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Critical Review of Cu&#8208;Based Hole Transport Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells: From Theoretical Insights to Experimental Validation</title>

Abstract
Despite the remarkable efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long&#8208;term stability remains the primary barrier to their commercialization. The prospect of enhancing stability by substituting organic transport layers with suitable inorganic compounds, particularly Cu&#8208;based inorganic hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs), holds promise due to their high valence band maximum (VBM) aligning with perovskite characteristics. This review assesses the advantages and disadvantages of these five types of Cu&#8208;based HTMs. Although Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues, the &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; (CMVB) strategy has successfully broadened the bandgap for Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides and chalcogenides. However, Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides encounter challenges with low mobility, and Cu&#8208;based ternary chalcogenides face mismatches in VBM alignment with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based binary halides, especially CuI, exhibit excellent properties such as wider bandgaps, high mobility, and defect tolerance, but their stability remains a concern. These limitations of single anion compounds are insightfully discussed, offering solutions from the perspective of practical application. Future research can focus on Cu&#8208;based composite anion compounds, which merge the advantages of single anion compounds. Additionally, mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides such as CuxM1&#8208;xS enable the customization of HTM properties by selecting and adjusting the proportions of cation M.

         <title>Stable Photo&#8208;Rechargeable Al Battery for Enhancing Energy Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable photo&#8208;rechargeable Al battery for integrated solar energy conversion storage is demonstrated to substantially enhance energy utilization. Illumination will generate photo&#8208;holes and electrons to improve the reaction pathway, along with boosting the electrochemical reaction. A novel strategy is designed to meet the practical operation condition within 24&#160;h, exhibiting energy saving because of decreased overpotential upon charging/discharging.









Abstract
Photovoltaic cells (PVs) are able to convert solar energy to electric energy, while energy storage devices are required to be equipped due to the fluctuations of sunlight. However, the electrical connection of PVs and energy storage devices leads to increased energy consumption, and thus energy storage ability and utilization efficiency are decreased. One of the solutions is to explore an integrated photoelectrochemical energy conversion&#8208;storage device. Up to date, the integrated photo&#8208;rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from unstable photo&#8208;active materials and flammable electrolytes under illumination, with concerns in safety risks and limited lifetime. To address the critical issues, here a novel photo&#8208;rechargeable aluminum battery (PRAB) is designed with safe ionic liquid electrolytes and stable polyaniline photo&#8208;electrodes. The integrated PRAB presents stable operation with an enhanced reversible specific capacity &#8776;191% under illumination. Meanwhile, a simplified continuum model is established to provide rational guidance for designing electrode structures along with a charging/discharging strategy to meet the practical operation conditions. The as&#8208;designed PRAB presents an energy&#8208;saving efficiency &#8776;61.92% upon charging and an energy output increment &#8776;31.25% during discharging under illumination. The strategy of designing and fabricating stable and safe photo&#8208;rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous Al batteries highlights the pathway for substantially promoting the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue and Fast Delayed Fluorescence from Carbene&#8211;Metal&#8211;Amides for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters, carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;amides (CMA), possess near unity photoluminescent quantum yields and record high radiative rates up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;s&#8722;1. Molecular design rules are explained to achieve and predict deep&#8208;blue CMA materials. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) emit deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with efficiency up to 25.7% with operating stability of 1 h at practical brightness. 








Abstract
Linear gold complexes of the &#8220;carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amide&#8221; (CMA) type are prepared with a rigid benzoguanidine amide donor and various carbene ligands. These complexes emit in the deep&#8208;blue range at 424 and 466&#160;nm with 100% quantum yields in all media. The deep&#8208;blue thermally activates delayed fluorescence originates from a charge transfer state with an excited state lifetime as low as 213&#160;ns, resulting in fast radiative rates of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;s&#8722;1. The high thermal and photo&#8208;stability of these carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amide (CMA) materials enabled the authors to fabricate highly energy&#8208;efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) in host&#8211;guest architectures. Deep&#8208;blue OLED devices with electroluminescence at 416 and 457&#160;nm with practical external quantum efficiencies of up to 23% at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 with excellent color coordinates CIE (x; y)&#160;=&#160;0.16; 0.07 and 0.17; 0.18 are reported. The operating stability of these OLEDs is the longest reported to date (LT50&#160;=&#160;1&#160;h) for deep&#8208;blue CMA emitters, indicating a high promise for further development of blue OLED devices. These findings inform the molecular design strategy and correlation between delayed luminescence with high radiative rates and CMA OLED device operating stability.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile as an Efficient Transfer Medium for Wafer&#8208;Scale Transfer of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by using polyacrylonitrile as the transfer medium and encapsulating layer, wafer&#8208;scale graphene transfer, devices fabrication, and efficient encapsulation against the airborne contaminations are successfully achieved, and the transferred graphene delivers improved electronic performances and long&#8208;term stability, offering a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding electronic quality.








Abstract
The disparity between growth substrates and application&#8208;specific substrates can be mediated by reliable graphene transfer, the lack of which currently strongly hinders the graphene applications. Conventionally, the removal of soft polymers, that support the graphene during the transfer, would contaminate graphene surface, produce cracks, and leave unprotected graphene surface sensitive to airborne contaminations. In this work, it is found that polyacrylonitrile (PAN) can function as polymer medium for transferring wafer&#8208;size graphene, and encapsulating layer to deliver high&#8208;performance graphene devices. Therefore, PAN, that is compatible with device fabrication, does not need to be removed for subsequent applications. The crack&#8208;free transfer of 4 in. graphene onto SiO2/Si wafers, and the wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays with no observed clear doping, uniformly high carrier mobility (&#8776;11&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability at room temperature, are achieved. This work presents new concept for designing the transfer process of 2D materials, in which multifunctional polymer can be retained, and offers a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding performance.

         <title>Nanogalvanic Cells Release Highly Reactive Electrons in Tumors to Effectively Eliminate Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogalvanic cells that can continuously release highly reactive electrons to tumors in the tumor microenvironment have been developed. These electrons can react with surrounding biomolecules within tumors, not only destroying these molecules but also generating highly cytotoxic reactive species independent of oxygen to kill cancer cells. This innovative therapy effectively eliminates tumors and provides immune surveillance for cured mice.








Abstract
External stimuli triggering chemical reactions in cancer cells to generate highly reactive chemical species are very appealing for cancer therapy, in which external irradiation activating sensitizers to transfer energy or electrons to surrounding oxygen or other molecules is critical for generating cytotoxic reactive species. However, poor light penetration into tissue, low activity of sensitizers, and reliance on oxygen supply restrict the generation of cytotoxic chemical species in hypoxic tumors, which lowers the therapeutic efficacy. Here, this work presents galvanic cell nanomaterials that can directly release highly reactive electrons in tumors without external irradiation or photosensitizers. The released reactive electrons directly react with surrounding biomolecules such as proteins and DNA within tumors to destroy them or react with other surrounding (bio)molecules to yield cytotoxic chemical species to eliminate tumors independent of oxygen. Administering these nanogalvanic cells to mice results in almost complete remission of subcutaneous solid tumors and deep metastatic tumors. The results demonstrate that this strategy can further arouse an immune response even in a hypoxic environment. This method offers a promising approach to effectively eliminate tumors, similar to photodynamic therapy, but does not require oxygen or irradiation to activate photosensitizers.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Bonded Co Single Atom Site on Boroncarbonitride Surface Realizes Nonsacrificial H2O2 Synthesis in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through constructing the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom on boroncarbonitride surface as the site of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron reduction of O2, the H2O2 evolution with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850&#160;nm is achieved. The hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom can avoid the formation of &#8226;O2&#8722; and reduce the breakage of O&#9472;O bond, reducing the energy barrier of H2O2 generation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 and H2O under near&#8208;infrared light is a sustainable renewable energy production strategy, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the regulation of O2 reduction path by photocatalyst. Herein, the center of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron reduction (OSR) pathway of O2 for H2O2 evolution via the formation of the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom sites on boroncarbonitride surface (BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1) is constructed. The experimental and theoretical prediction results confirm that the hydroxyl group on the surface and the electronic band structure of BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1 are the key factor in regulating the O2 reduction pathway. In addition, the hydroxyl&#8208;bonded Co single&#8208;atom sites can further enrich O2 molecules with more electrons, which can avoid the one&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to &#8226;O2&#8722;, thus promoting the direct two&#8208;electron activation hydrogenation of O2. Consequently, BCN&#8208;OH2/Co1 exhibits a high H2O2 evolution apparent quantum efficiency of 0.8% at 850&#160;nm, better than most of the previously reported photocatalysts. This study reveals an important reaction pathway for the generation of H2O2, emphasizing that precise control of the active site structure of the photocatalyst is essential for achieving efficient conversion of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical.

         <title>Expanded ROS Generation and Hypoxia Reversal: Excipient&#8208;free Self&#8208;assembled Nanotheranostics for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that the self&#8208;assembled excipient&#8208;free ISDN overcomes the inefficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity of photosensitizers and PDT&#8208;aggravated hypoxia constrains immunity. The hydrophobic interaction forces between ICG and 17&#8208;dimethylaminoethylamino&#8208;17&#8208;demethoxygeldanamycin (17&#8208;DMAG) can promote the photostability of ICG and facilitate its ISC process, resulting in a significant improvement in ROS yield and achieving a potent systemic immune response against pancreatic cancer.








Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;related cancer therapies is significantly restricted by two irreconcilable obstacles, i.e., low reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability and hypoxia which constrains the immune response. Herein, this work develops a self&#8208;assembled clinical photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) and the HSP90 inhibitor 17&#8208;dimethylaminoethylamino&#8208;17&#8208;demethoxygeldanamycin (17&#8208;DMAG) nanoparticles (ISDN) without any excipient. This work discovers that the hydrophobic interaction forces between ICG and 17&#8208;DMAG promote the photostability of ICG and its intersystem crossing (ISC) process, thereby improving the ROS quantum yield from 0.112 to 0.46. Augmented ROS generation enhances PDT efficacy and further enhances immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects. 17&#8208;DMAG inhibits the HSP90/hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) axis to dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment caused by PDT&#8208;aggravated hypoxia. In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, ISDN markedly improve cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration and MHC I and MHC II activation, demonstrating the superior ICD effects in situ tumor and the powerful systematic antitumor immunity generation, eventually achieving vigorous antitumor and recurrence resistance. This study proposes an unsophisticated and versatile strategy to significantly improve PDT efficacy for enhancing systemic antitumor immunity and potentially extending it to multiple cancers.

         <title>Prestrain Guided Yield of Large Single&#8208;Crystal Nickel Foils with High&#8208;Index Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, the largest one of which exceeds 5&#215;8 cm2 in size, are successfully produced through prestrain energy engineering technique, in which the strain energy drives the single crystal conversion. High&#8208;quality graphite films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils, and the graphite/Ni(012) foil composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity compared to polycrystalline nickel foil.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets are currently being investigated owing to their potential application in the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;quality van der Waals film materials, electrochemical catalysis, gas sensing, and other fields. However, the controllable synthesis of large single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets remains a great challenge because high&#8208;index facets with high surface energy are not preferentially formed thermodynamically and kinetically. Herein, single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with a series of high&#8208;index facets are efficiently prepared by applying prestrain energy engineering technique, with the largest single&#8208;crystal foil exceeding 5&#215;8 cm2 in size. In terms of thermodynamics, the internal mechanism of prestrain regulation on the formation of high&#8208;index facets is proposed. Molecular dynamics simulation is utilized to replicate and explain the phenomenon of multiple crystallographic orientations resulting from prestrain regulation. Additionally, large&#8208;sized and high&#8208;quality graphite films are successfully fabricated on single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils. Compared to the polycrystalline nickel, the graphite/single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foil composites show more than five&#8208;fold increase in thermal conductivity, thereby showing great potential applications in thermal management. This study hence presents a novel approach for the preparation of single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, which is beneficial for the epitaxial growth of certain two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials.

As electric vehicles, portable electronic devices, and tools have increasingly high requirements for battery energy density and power density, constantly improving battery performance is a research focus. Accurate measurement of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of active materials is key to advancing the research of high&#8208;performance batteries. However, conventional performance tests of active materials are based on the electrochemical measurement of porous composite electrodes containing active materials, polymer binders, and conductive carbon additives, which cannot establish an accurate structure&#8211;activity relationship with the physical characterization of microregions. In this review, in order to promote the accurate measurement and understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of materials, the electrochemical measurement and physical characterization of energy storage materials at single&#8208;particle scale are reviewed. The potential problems and possible improvement schemes of the single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization are proposed. Their potential applications in single particle electrochemical simulation and machine learning are prospected. This review aims to promote the further application of single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization in energy storage materials, hoping to achieve 3D unified evaluation of physical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and theoretical simulation at the single particle scale to provide new inspiration for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aligned Piezoelectric Nanofibers Derived Hydrogel Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel nerve guidance conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration are proposed. The aligned piezoelectric nanofibers inner layer possesses aligned orientation and US&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation, while poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel outer layer provides controllable drug release to promote nerve regeneration. Such conduits can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve regeneration of rats with long sciatic nerve defects.








Abstract
Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are considered as promising treatment strategy and frontier trend for peripheral nerve regeneration, while their therapeutic outcomes are limited by the lack of controllable drug delivery and available physicochemical cues. Herein, novel aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs with ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation (ES) and controllable drug release for repairing peripheral nerve injury are proposed. The inner layer of the NGCs is the barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles (BTNPs)&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene [BTNPs/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] electrospinning nanofibers with improved piezoelectricity and aligned orientation. The outer side of the NGCs is the thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel with bioactive drug encapsulation. Such NGCs can not only induce neuronal&#8208;oriented extension and promote neurite outgrowth with US&#8208;triggered wireless ES, but also realize the controllable nerve growth factor release with the hydrogel shrinkage under US&#8208;triggered heating. Thus, the NGC can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve axonal regeneration of rat models with long sciatic nerve defects. It is believed that the proposed US&#8208;responsive aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs will find important applications in clinic neural tissue engineering.

         <title>Pendant Group Functionalization of Cyclic Olefin for High Temperature and High&#8208;Density Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;temperature flexible polymer dielectrics are critical for high&#8208;power&#8208;density energy storage and conversion under harsh operating conditions. These types of dielectrics will need to simultaneously possess a high bandgap, dielectric constant and glass transition temperature &#8212; a substantial challenge when designing novel dielectric polymers. In this work, by varying halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant hanging off a bicyclic mainchain polymer, a class of high&#8208;temperature olefins with adjustable thermal stability are obtained, all with uncompromised large bandgaps. Halogens substitution of the pendant groups at para or ortho position of polyoxanorborneneimides (PONB) imparts it with tunable high glass transition temperature from &#8764;220 to 245&#160;&#176;C, while with also moderate dielectric constant of &#8764; 2.8&#8211;3.0 and high breakdown strength of &#8764;625&#8211;800&#160;MV/m. A high energy density of 7.1 J/cc at 200&#160;&#176;C is achieved with p&#8208;POClNB, representing the highest reported energy density among all&#8208;organic homo&#8208;polymer dielectrics. Molecular dynamic simulations and ultrafast infrared spectroscopy were used to probe the free volume element distribution and chain relaxations of the polymers to provide insights to the dielectric thermal properties. An increase in free volume element is observed with the change in the pendant group from fluorine to bromine at the para position; however, a decrease in free volume element is observed as we change the pendant group from fluorine to chlorine at the ortho position because of the steric hindrance. Overall, the dielectric constant and band gap remain stable while the glass transition temperature changes more obviously. Consequently, by proper designing the pendant groups, the thermal stability of PONB can be improved for harsh condition electrification.

         <title>Emerging 2D Ferroelectric Devices for In&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, the 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing.








Abstract
The quantity of sensor nodes within current computing systems is rapidly increasing in tandem with the sensing data. The presence of a bottleneck in data transmission between the sensors, computing, and memory units obstructs the system's efficiency and speed. To minimize the latency of data transmission between units, novel in&#8208;memory and in&#8208;sensor computing architectures are proposed as alternatives to the conventional von Neumann architecture, aiming for data&#8208;intensive sensing and computing applications. The integration of 2D materials and 2D ferroelectric materials has been expected to build these novel sensing and computing architectures due to the dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, ultra&#8208;fast polarization flipping, and ultra&#8208;low power consumption of the 2D ferroelectrics. Here, the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing is reviewed. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices, are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing. As an emerging device configuration, 2D ferroelectric devices have the potential to expand into the sensor&#8208;memory and computing integration application field, leading to new possibilities for modern electronics.

         <title>General Fabrication of Robust Alloyed Metal Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a general, straightforward, yet highly effective method for fabricating alloyed metal anodes, which are achieved by electromagnetic&#160;induction heating of anode metals, substrate metals, and alloying metals. The novel approach aims to address persistent dendrite formation, limited cyclicity, and suboptimal energy density associated with metal anodes in practical rechargeable metal batteries.








Abstract
Revitalizing metal anodes for rechargeable batteries confronts challenges such as dendrite formation, limited cyclicity, and suboptimal energy density. Despite various efforts, a practical fabrication method for dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes remains unavailable. Herein, focusing on Li as exemplar, a general strategy is reported to enhance reversibility of the metal anodes by forming alloyed metals, which is achieved by induction heating of 3D substrate, lithiophilic metals, and Li within tens of seconds. It is demonstrated that preferred alloying interactions between substrates and lithiophilic metals created a lithiophilic metal&#8208;rich region adjacent to the substrate, serving as ultrastable lithiophilic host to guide dendrite&#8208;free deposition, particularly during prolonged high&#8208;capacity cycling. Simultaneously, an alloying between lithiophilic metals and Li creates a Li&#8208;rich region adjacent to electrolyte that reduces nucleation overpotential and constitutes favorable electrolyte&#8208;Li interface. The resultant composite Li anodes paired with high areal loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes achieve superior cycling stability and remarkable energy density above 1200 Wh L&#8722;1 (excluding packaging). Furthermore, this approach shows broader applicability to other metal anodes plagued by dendrite&#8208;related challenges, such as Na and Zn. Overall, this work paves the way for development of commercially viable metal&#8208;based batteries that offer a combination of safety, high energy density, and durability.

Ultra&#8208;thin layered double hydroxides (LDH) provide a stable and conductive confined space and dual&#8208;type semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the microenvironment. The flexible Co9S8&#8208;CdS/LDH exhibits high redox activity and stability. These findings provide unique insights for developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.








Abstract
Owing to the quantum size effect and high redox activity, quantum dots (QDs) play very essential roles toward electrochemical energy storage. However, it is very difficult to obtain different types and uniformly dispersed high&#8208;active QDs in a stable conductive microenvironment, because QDs prepared by traditional methods are mostly dissolved in solution or loaded on the surface of other semiconductors. Herein, dual&#8208;type semiconductor QDs (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the interlayer of ultrathin&#8208;layered double hydroxides. In&#160;particular, the expandable interlayer provides a very suitable confined space for the growth and uniform dispersion of QDs, where Co9S8 originates from in situ transformation of cobalt atoms in laminate and CdS is generated from interlayer pre&#8208;embedding Cd2+. Meanwhile, XAFS and GGA+U calculations are employed to explore and prove the mechanism of QDs formation and energy storage characteristics as compared to surface loading QDs. Significantly, the hybrid supercapacitors achieve a high energy density of 329.2&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2, capacitance retention of 99.1%, and coulomb efficiency of 96.9% after 22&#160;000 cycles, which is superior to the reported QDs&#8208;based supercapacitors. These findings provide unique insights for designing and developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.

         <title>Oxygen Doping Cooperated with Co&#8208;N&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Sites: Synergistic Mechanism for Catalytic Water Purification within Nanoconfined Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationships between synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;properties are unraveled based on Mantel test, correlation analysis, and evolution of metal central sites. The as&#8208;synthesized oxygen doping cooperated with Co&#8208;N&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites exhibits high activity and selectivity for SO4&#8226;&#8722; generation during PMS activation. Building upon these findings, a separation catalysis membrane loading OCN&#8208;Co/Fe catalysts within microreactors is constructed, which displays exceptional permeability and durability.








Abstract
Atom&#8208;site catalysts, especially for graphitic carbon nitride&#8208;based catalysts, represents one of the most promising candidates in catalysis membrane for water decontamination. However, unravelling the intricate relationships between synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;properties remains a great challenge. This study addresses the impacts of coordination environment and structure units of metal central sites based on Mantel test, correlation analysis, and evolution of metal central sites. An optimized unconventional oxygen doping cooperated with Co&#8208;N&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites (OCN Co/Fe) exhibits synergistic mechanism for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation, which benefits from a significant increase in charge density at the active sites and the regulation in the natural population of orbitals, leading to selective generation of SO4&#8226;&#8722;. Building upon these findings, the OCN&#8208;Co/Fe/PVDF composite membrane demonstrates a 33&#160;min&#8722;1 ciprofloxacin (CIP) rejection efficiency and maintains over 96% CIP removal efficiency (over 24&#160;h) with an average permeance of 130.95&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This work offers a fundamental guide for elucidating the definitive origin of catalytic performance in advance oxidation process to facilitate the rational design of separation catalysis membrane with improved performance and enhanced stability.

         <title>Acoustically Enhanced Triboelectric Stethoscope for Ultrasensitive Cardiac Sounds Sensing and Disease Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically analyzes the electromechanical output characteristics between a contact&#8208;separation triboelectric nanogenerator and a piezoelectric generator and proposes that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originates from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test.








Abstract
Electronic stethoscope used to detect cardiac sounds that contain essential clinical information is a primary tool for diagnosis of various cardiac disorders. However, the linear electromechanical constitutive relation makes conventional piezoelectric sensors rather ineffective to detect low&#8208;intensity, low&#8208;frequency heart acoustic signal without the assistance of complex filtering and amplification circuits. Herein, it is found that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originated from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. As a result, the triboelectric sensor shows ultrahigh sensitivity (1215&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) than the piezoelectric counterpart (21&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) in the sound pressure range of 50&#8211;80&#160;dB under the same testing condition. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity with a power function cross&#8208;section to achieve acoustic energy converging and impedance matching, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test (2.3 times of that for piezoelectric one). Further combining with machine learning, five cardiac states can be diagnosed at 97% accuracy. In general, the triboelectric sensor is distinctly unique in basic mechanism, provides a novel design concept for sensing micromechanical quantities, and presents significant potential for application in cardiac sounds sensing and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Edible Long&#8208;Afterglow Photoluminescent Materials for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is proposed to construct edible photoluminescent long&#8208;afterglow materials by embedding luminophore multicarboxylates into a series of inorganic salt lattices. Particularly, edible afterglow barium meal formed by coronene salt doped BaSO4 can be applied into gastrointestinal afterglow imaging captured by instruments or mobile phone.








Abstract
Confining luminophores into modified hydrophilic matrices or polymers is a straightforward and widely used approach for afterglow bioimaging. However, the afterglow quantum yield and lifetime of the related material remain unsatisfactory, severely limiting the using effect especially for deep&#8208;tissue time&#8208;resolved imaging. This fact largely stems from the dilemma between material biocompatibility and the quenching effect of water environment. Herein an in situ metathesis promoted doping strategy is presented, namely, mixing &#8776;10&#8722;3 weight ratio of organic&#8208;emitter multicarboxylates with inorganic salt reactants, followed by metathesis reactions to prepare a series of hydrophilic but water&#8208;insoluble organic&#8211;inorganic doping afterglow materials. This strategy leads to the formation of edible long&#8208;afterglow photoluminescent materials with superior biocompatibility and excellent bioimaging effect. The phosphorescence quantum yield of the materials can reach dozens of percent (the highest case: 66.24%), together with the photoluminescent lifetime lasting for coupes of seconds. Specifically, a long&#8208;afterglow barium meal formed by coronene salt emitter and BaSO4 matrix is applied into animal experiments by gavage, and bright stomach afterglow imaging is observed by instruments or mobile phone after ceasing the photoexcitation with deep tissue penetration. This strategy allows a flexible dosage of the materials during bioimaging, facilitating the development of real&#8208;time probing and theranostic technology.

         <title>The Unprecedented Biodegradable Polyzwitterion: A Removal&#8208;Free Patch for Accelerating Infected Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A removal&#8208;free and self&#8208;immolative polyzwitterion patch prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;based zwitterion can be used as a wound dressing to accelerate infected diabetic wound repair due to its ability to inhibit the bacterial adhesion, kill bacteria, and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species at the wound site to regulate the local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine expression, and macrophage polarization.








Abstract
Zwitterionic polymers have emerged as an important class of biomaterials to construct wound dressings and antifouling coatings over the past decade due to their excellent hydrophilicity. However, all the reported zwitterionic polymers as wound dressings are nondegradable because of noncleavable carbon&#9472;carbon bonding backbones, and must be removed periodically after treatment to avoid hypoxia in the wound, thus leading to potential secondary injury. In this work, a biodegradable polyzwitterion patch is fabricated for the first time by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of carboxybetaine dithiolane (CBDS), which is self&#8208;crosslinked via inter&#8208;amide hydrogen bonds and zwitterionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions on the side chains. The unprecedented polyCBDS (PCBDS) patch demonstrates enough ductility owing to the intermolecular physical interactions to fully cover irregular wounds, also showing excellent biodegradability and antifouling performance resulted from the existence of disulfide bonds and carboxybetaine groups. Besides, the PCBDS degradation&#8208;induced released CBDS owns potent antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This PCBDS patch is used as a diabetic wound dressing, inhibiting bacterial adhesion on the external surface, and its degradation products can exactly kill bacteria and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the wound site to regulate local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine express and macrophage polarization, accelerating infected diabetic wound repair, and also avoiding the potential secondary injury.

&lt;p&gt;A removal-free and self-immolative polyzwitterion patch prepared by ring-opening polymerization of dithiolane-based zwitterion can be used as a wound dressing to accelerate infected diabetic wound repair due to its ability to inhibit the bacterial adhesion, kill bacteria, and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species at the wound site to regulate the local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine expression, and macrophage polarization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zwitterionic polymers have emerged as an important class of biomaterials to construct wound dressings and antifouling coatings over the past decade due to their excellent hydrophilicity. However, all the reported zwitterionic polymers as wound dressings are nondegradable because of noncleavable carbon&lt;i&gt;&#9472;&lt;/i&gt;carbon bonding backbones, and must be removed periodically after treatment to avoid hypoxia in the wound, thus leading to potential secondary injury. In this work, a biodegradable polyzwitterion patch is fabricated for the first time by ring-opening polymerization of carboxybetaine dithiolane (CBDS), which is self-crosslinked via inter-amide hydrogen bonds and zwitterionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions on the side chains. The unprecedented polyCBDS (PCBDS) patch demonstrates enough ductility owing to the intermolecular physical interactions to fully cover irregular wounds, also showing excellent biodegradability and antifouling performance resulted from the existence of disulfide bonds and carboxybetaine groups. Besides, the PCBDS degradation-induced released CBDS owns potent antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This PCBDS patch is used as a diabetic wound dressing, inhibiting bacterial adhesion on the external surface, and its degradation products can exactly kill bacteria and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the wound site to regulate local microenvironment, including regulation of cytokine express and macrophage polarization, accelerating infected diabetic wound repair, and also avoiding the potential secondary injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Slippery Surfaces for Liquid Manipulation from Tiny Droplet to Bulk Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired slippery surfaces, which originate in nature and possess unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion, have broad application prospects in liquid manipulation from tiny droplets to bulk liquid, such as water collection, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, drag&#8208;reduction, anti&#8208;icing, and anticorrosion.








Abstract
Slippery surfaces, which originate in nature with special wettability, have attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and practical applications in a variety of fields due to their unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion. Although research on bioinspired slippery surfaces is still in its infancy, it is a rapidly growing and enormously promising field. Herein, a systematic review of recent progress in bioinspired slippery surfaces, beginning with a brief introduction of several typical creatures with slippery property in nature, is presented. Subsequently,this review gives a detailed discussion on the basic concepts of the wetting, friction, and drag from micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;aspects and focuses on the underlying slippery mechanism. Next, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in three categories of slippery surfaces of air&#8208;trapped, liquid&#8208;infused, and liquid&#8208;like slippery surfaces, including materials, design principles, and preparation methods, are summarized and the emerging applications are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of various slippery surfaces are addressed.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Oriented Eutectic Additive Design toward Stable Zn Anodes with a High Depth of Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), is investigated to regulate the electric double layer for long&#8208;lived and highly (002) textured Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge. The hydrogen bond network in EDL can be interrupted to suppress HER effectively. The enrichment of GPC in charge&#8208;rich sites leads to a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and dendrite termination.








Abstract
ZnSO4&#8208;based electrolytes for aqueous zinc ion batteries fail to meet practical application metrics due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. In this work, a highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) is rationally designed, to regulate the electric double layer (EDL) structure for stable Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge (DOD). On one hand, GPC molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups can precisely regulate the hydrogen bond network in EDL to suppress HER. On the other hand, the enrichment of GPC at the interface is positively responsible for the negative charge density on the Zn surface, which leads to the formation of a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and terminates dendrite growth in the charge&#8208;rich sites. This EDL&#8208;oriented eutectic additive engineering enables highly reversible and selectively (002)&#8208;textured Zn anodes to operate for over 1450&#160;h at a high DOD of 45.3%. Meanwhile, a high&#8208;capacity (185.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) aqueous Zn||VS2 full cell shows remarkable cycling stability over 220 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% even at a low current density of 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (0.5&#160;C). This work sheds light on electrolyte design and interface engineering for high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Structural Defect&#8208;Enabled Magnetic Neutrality Nanoprobes for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Isolated Tumor Cells in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) featuring exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility is constructed through an ingenious structural defect&#8208;enhanced strategy. Remarkably, under 9 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the MNN records an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling high&#8208;performance ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field MR imaging of previously MRI&#8208;undetectable isolated tumor cells with an extraordinary detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm.








Abstract
The identification of metastasis &#8220;seeds,&#8221; isolated tumor cells (ITCs), is of paramount importance for the prognosis and tailored treatment of metastatic diseases. The conventional approach to clinical ITCs diagnosis through invasive biopsies is encumbered by the inherent risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This underscores the pressing need for noninvasive ITCs detection methods that provide histopathological&#8208;level insights. Recent advancements in ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have ignited hope for the revelation of minute lesions, including the elusive ITCs. Nevertheless, currently available MRI contrast agents are susceptible to magnetization&#8208;induced strong T2&#8208;decaying effects under UHF conditions, which compromises T1 MRI capability and further impedes the precise imaging of small lesions. Herein, this study reports a structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) distinguished by its paramagnetic properties featuring an exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility through atomic modulation, rendering it almost nonmagnetic. This unique characteristic effectively mitigates T2&#8208;decaying effect while concurrently enhancing UHF T1 contrast. Under 9 T MRI, the MNN demonstrates an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling noninvasive visualization of ITCs with an exceptional detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm. These high&#8208;performance MNNs unveil the domain of hitherto undetectable minute lesions, representing a significant advancement in UHF&#8208;MRI for diagnostic purposes and fostering comprehensive metastasis research.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: The Effect of Magnetic Field Direction and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropy magnetoresistance (AMR) and its temperature dependent are measured, in a crossbar geometry, for chiral oligopeptide monolayers. Periodicity of 360&#176; is observed in the AMR. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be simulated only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling, which includes contribution from vibrations.








Abstract
Chiral oligopeptide monolayers are adsorbed on a ferromagnetic surface and their magnetoresistance is measured as a function of the angle between the magnetization of the ferromagnet and the surface normal. These measurements are conducted as a function of temperature for both enantiomers. The angle dependence is found to follow a changing trend with a period of&#8197;360&#176;. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be obtained only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling (SOC), that includes contribution from the vibrations. The model shows that SOC only in the leads cannot reproduce the observed angular dependence. The simulation can reproduce the experiments if it included electron&#8211;phonon interactions and dissipation.

         <title>Activating Iterative Revolutions of the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle in Hypoxic Tumors with a Smart Nano&#8208;Regulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a smart nano&#8208;regulator (PNBJQ) with hypoxic tolerance and tumor&#8208;selectivity. PNBJQ focuses on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes encompassing the induction of immunogenic cancer cell death and the abrogation of immune resistance. This precise modulation activates the iterative revolution of cancer&#8208;immune cycle, resulting in a remarkable suppression of bilateral tumors under low light dose irradiation without side effects.








Abstract
The activation of sequential events in the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC) is crucial for achieving effective antitumor immunity. However, formidable challenges, such as innate and adaptive immune resistance, along with the off&#8208;target adverse effects of nonselective immunomodulators, persist. In this study, a tumor&#8208;selective nano&#8208;regulator named PNBJQ has been presented, focusing on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes: inducing immunogenic cancer cell death and abrogating immune resistance to fully activate endogenous tumor immunity. PNBJQ is obtained by encapsulating the immunomodulating agent JQ1 within a self&#8208;assembling system formed by linking a Type&#8208;I photosensitizer to polyethylene glycol through a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive azo bond. Benefiting from the Type&#8208;I photosensitive mechanism, PNBJQ triggers the immunogenic cell death of hypoxic tumors under near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#160;light irradiation. This process resolves innate immune resistance by stimulating sufficient cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes. Simultaneously, PNBJQ smartly responds to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment for precise drug delivery, adeptly addressing adaptive immune resistance by using JQ1 to downregulate programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and sustaining the response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The activatable synergic photoimmunotherapy promotes an immune&#8208;promoting tumor microenvironment by activating an iterative revolution of the CIC, which remarkably eradicates established hypoxic tumors and suppresses distal lesions under low light dose irradiation.

         <title>Bioprinting&#8208;Assisted Tissue Assembly for Structural and Functional Modulation of Engineered Heart Tissue Mimicking Left Ventricular Myocardial Fiber Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioprinting&#8208;assisted tissue assembly, a hierarchical additive manufacturing process, enables the construction of intricate structures. This approach facilitates directional modulation of the structure and functions of uniaxial living tissues. In addition, it induces tissue integration, allowing several building blocks to function as single tissues. Consequently, this work generates a chamber&#8208;like tissue mimicking the myocardial fiber orientation and twisting function.








Abstract
Left ventricular twist is influenced by the unique oriented structure of myocardial fibers. Replicating this intricate structural&#8208;functional relationship in an in vitro heart model remains challenging, mainly due to the difficulties in achieving a complex structure with synchrony between layers. This study introduces a novel approach through the utilization of bioprinting&#8208;assisted tissue assembly (BATA)&#8212;a synergistic integration of bioprinting and tissue assembly strategies. By flexibly manufacturing tissue modules and assembly platforms, BATA can create structures that traditional methods find difficult to achieve. This approach integrates engineered heart tissue (EHT) modules, each with intrinsic functional and structural characteristics, into a layered, multi&#8208;oriented tissue in a controlled manner. EHTs assembled in different orientations exhibit various contractile forces and electrical signal patterns. The BATA is capable of constructing complex myocardial fiber orientations within a chamber&#8208;like structure (MoCha). MoCha replicates the native cardiac architecture by exhibiting three layers and three alignment directions, and it reproduces the left ventricular twist by exhibiting synchronized contraction between layers and mimicking the native cardiac architecture. The potential of BATA extends to engineering tissues capable of constructing and functioning as complete organs on a large scale. This advancement holds the promise of realizing future organ&#8208;on&#8208;demand technology.

         <title>Side Reactions/Changes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Strategies for Creating Safer and Better Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are considered the most competitive energy storage devices. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in which lithium ions function as charge carriers, are considered the most competitive energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density. However, battery materials, especially with high capacity undergo side reactions and changes that result in capacity decay and safety issues. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components and the mechanisms of those reactions is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors. Voltage&#8208;induced failures result from anode interfacial reactions, current collector corrosion, cathode interfacial reactions, overcharge, and over&#8208;discharge, while temperature&#8208;induced failure mechanisms include SEI decomposition, separator damage, and interfacial reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. The review also presents protective strategies for controlling these reactions. As a result, the reader is offered a comprehensive overview of the safety features and failure mechanisms of various LIB components.

         <title>A Suspended, 3D Morphing Sensory System for Robots to Feel and Protect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended electronic skins that enable structural integration of high&#8208;sensitive touch and dynamic pain perception are rationally designed through 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact mechanism, which show potentials in friendly human&#8211;robot interaction for active feel and protect.








Abstract
Artificial sensory systems with synergistic touch and pain perception hold substantial promise for environment interaction and human&#8211;robot communication. However, the realization of biological skin&#8208;like functional integration of sensors with sensitive touch and pain perception still remains a challenge. Here, a concept is proposed of suspended electronic skins enabling 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact interactions for achieving synergetic ultrasensitive touch and adjustable pain perception. The suspended sensory system can sensitively capture tiny touch stimuli as low as 0.02&#160;Pa and actively perceive pain response with reliable 5200 cycles via 3D deformation and mechanical contact mechanism, respectively. Based on the touch&#8208;pain effect, a visualized feedback demo with miniaturized sensor arrays on artificial fingers is rationally designed to give a pain perception mapping on sharp surfaces. Furthermore, the capability is shown of the suspended electronic skin serving as a safe human&#8211;robot communication interface from active and passive view through a feedback control system, demonstrating potential in bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

         <title>Topology Reconfiguration of Anion&#8208;Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Framework from Flexibility to Rigidity for Enhanced Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a solvent&#8208;mediated approach to regulate the flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting its topology, resulting in the transformation from flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql MOFs to rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds MOFs. This topology transformation strategy effectively enhances the adsorption capacity and kinetics for C2H2. Computational simulations and breakthrough experiments validate the effectiveness of this topology transformation strategy for gas separations.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate&#8208;opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, a solvent&#8208;mediated approach is presented to regulate the flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'&#8208;dipyridyldisulfide) with sql topology into rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds with cds topology. Notably, the cds topology is unprecedented and first obtained in anion&#8208;pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds exhibits enhanced C2H2 adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (21.06 cm3 g&#8722;1). The topology transformation also facilitates the adsorption kinetics for C2H2, exhibiting a 6.5&#8208;fold enhanced diffusion time constant (D/r2) of 1.71 &#215; 10&#8722;3 s&#8722;1 on CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds than that of CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (2.64 &#215; 10&#8722;4 s&#8722;1). Multiple computational simulations reveal the structural transformations and guest&#8211;host interactions in both adsorbents. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt;99.996%) effluent with a productivity of 93.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 can be directly collected from C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) gas&#8208;mixture in a single CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds column.

         <title>Transdermal Sensing of Enzyme Biomarker Enabled by Chemo&#8208;Responsive Probe&#8208;Modified Epidermal Microneedle Patch in Human Skin Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable bioelectronics marks a substantial leap forward in healthcare applications, particularly biosensing, providing an alternative approach to monitoring individual health. The methodology and design presented herein underscore the transformative impact of wearable microneedle technologies in combination with target&#8208;specific smart chemo&#8208;responsive probes on personalized healthcare, emphasizing their role in transdermal sensing and early intervention in melanoma management.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics represents a significant breakthrough in healthcare settings, particularly in (bio)sensing which offers an alternative way to track individual health for diagnostics and therapy. However, there has been no notable improvement in the field of cancer, particularly for skin cancer. Here, a wearable bioelectronic patch is established for transdermal sensing of the melanoma biomarker, tyrosinase (Tyr), using a microneedle array integrated with a surface&#8208;bound chemo&#8208;responsive smart probe to enable target&#8208;specific electrochemical detection of Tyr directly from human skin tissue. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of a transdermal microneedle sensor for direct quantification of enzyme biomarkers in an ex vivo skin model. Initial performance analysis of the transdermal microneedle sensor proves that the designed methodology can be an alternative for fast and reliable diagnosis of melanoma and the evaluation of skin moles. The innovative approach presented here may revolutionize the landscape of skin monitoring by offering a nondisruptive means for continuous surveillance and timely intervention of skin anomalies, such as inflammatory skin diseases or allergies and can be extended to the screening of multiple responses of complementary biomarkers with simple modification in device design.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Materials Incorporating Rare Earth/Transition Metal Ions: From Materials to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various synthesis techniques on how to subtly incorporate rare earth/transition metals into various matrices in the NIR are reviewed, followed by a discussion of strategies to improve the excitation absorption and emission efficiency of NIR materials. Finally, functionalization strategies and their applications are presented. As such it provides a valuable overview of the field.








Abstract
The spotlight has shifted to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials emitting beyond 1000 nm, with growing interest due to their unique characteristics. The ability of NIR&#8208;II emission (1000&#8211;1700 nm) to penetrate deeply and transmit independently positions these NIR luminescent materials for applications in optical&#8208;communication devices, bioimaging, and photodetectors. The combination of rare earth metals/transition metals with a variety of matrix materials provides a new platform for creating new chemical and physical properties for materials science and device applications. In this review, the recent advancements in NIR emission activated by rare earth and transition metal ions are summarized and their role in applications spanning bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronics is illustrated. It started with various synthesis techniques and explored how rare earths/transition metals can be skillfully incorporated into various matrixes, thereby endowing them with unique characteristics. The discussion to strategies of enhancing excitation absorption and emission efficiency, spotlighting innovations like dye sensitization and surface plasmon resonance effects is then extended. Subsequently, a significant focus is placed on functionalization strategies and their applications. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and proposed strategies for rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials, summarizing the insights of each section is provided.

         <title>Topological Defect&#8208;Regulated Porous Carbon Anodes with Fast Interfacial and Bulk Kinetics for High&#8208;Rate and High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topologically defective porous carbon materials for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are successfully developed by thermal&#8208;driven atomic rearrangement strategy. The topological defects can effectively regulate the electronic structure of carbon skeleton, which simultaneously enables efficient&#160;potassium adsorption as well as fast solid&#8208;phase and interphase potassium diffusion.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are regarded as one of the most promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), but their rate capabilities are largely limited by the slow solid&#8208;state potassium diffusion kinetics inside anode and sluggish interfacial potassium ion transfer process. Herein, high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity PIBs are demonstrated by facile topological defect&#8208;regulation of the microstructure of carbon anodes. The carbon lattice of the as&#8208;obtained porous carbon nanosheets (CNSs) with abundant topological defects (TDPCNSs) holds relatively high&#160;potassium adsorption energy yet low potassium migration barrier, thereby enabling efficient storage and diffusion of potassium inside graphitic layers. Moreover, the topological defects can induce preferential decomposition of anions, leading to the formation of high potassium ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with decreased potassium ion de&#8208;solvation and transfer barrier. Additionally, the dominant sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon conjugated skeleton of TDPCNSs enables high electrical conductivity (39.4 S cm&#8722;1) and relatively low potassium storage potential. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed TDPCNSs anode demonstrates high potassium storage capacity (504&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (118&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1), as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>A Rational Design of Bio&#8208;Derived Disulfide CANs for Wearable Capacitive Pressure Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work of an elastic dynamic adaptive polymer(disulfide) decorated with H bonds and metal&#8208;catechol complexations to construct into a sandwich&#8208;like, self&#8208;healable, closed&#8208;loop recyclable capacitive sensor with ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, decent stability, and the capability of monitoring various human motions on a real&#8208;time basis.








Abstract
Classic approaches to integrate flexible capacitive sensor performance are to on&#8208;demand microstructuring dielectric layers and to adjust dielectric material compositions via the introduction of insoluble carbon additives (to increase sensitivity) or dynamic interactions (to achieve self&#8208;healing). However, the sensor's enhanced performances often come with increased material complexity, discouraging its circular economy. Herein, a new intrinsic self&#8208;healable, closed&#8208;loop recyclable dielectric layer material, a fully nature&#8208;derived dynamic covalent poly(disulfide) decorated with rich H bonding and metal&#8208;catechol complexations is introduced. The polymer network possesses a mechanically ductile character with an Arrhenius&#8208;type temperature&#8208;dependent viscoelasticity. The assembled capacitive pressure sensor is able to achieve a sensitivity of up to 9.26&#160;kPa&#8722;1, fast response/recovery time of 32/24&#160;ms, and can deliver consistent signals of continuous consecutive cycles even after being self&#8208;healed or closed&#8208;loop recycled for real&#8208;time detection of human motions. This is expected to be of high interest for current capacitive sensing research to move toward a life&#8208;like, high performance, and circular economy direction.

         <title>A Single Component, Single Layer Flexile Foam Evaporator with the Higher Efficiency for Water Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a single component hydrophilic polymer evaporator with a record evaporation rate of 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun and excellent resistance to mechanical and chemical damage. This flexible polymer evaporator has a new evaporation model and it is easy to synthesis and mold for better practical application in conjunction with automation equipment.








Abstract
One of the greenest and promising ways to solve the problem of freshwater crisis is surface solar steam generation from seawater. A great number of photothermal materials with multi&#8208;component and multi&#8208;layered delicate yet complex structures often suffer from either low evaporation rate or high energy loss. Here, this work presents a single component foam evaporator with steam generation rate of up to 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator is constructed from an aniline oligomer as a single light&#8208;absorbing component, covalent linked with polyethylene glycol to form a monolithic polymer foam. Floating on the seawater, the foam has absorbance of 99.5% over the entire solar spectral range and low thermal conductivity (0.0077&#160;W K&#8722;1m&#8722;1) that effectively retains heat in the material and at the interface. After 3 months of continuous outdoor natural sunlight irradiation, the evaporator maintains a stable and durable evaporation rate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greenest and promising ways to solve the problem of freshwater crisis is surface solar steam generation from seawater. A great number of photothermal materials with multi-component and multi-layered delicate yet complex structures often suffer from either low evaporation rate or high energy loss. Here, this work presents a single component foam evaporator with steam generation rate of up to 4.32&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator is constructed from an aniline oligomer as a single light-absorbing component, covalent linked with polyethylene glycol to form a monolithic polymer foam. Floating on the seawater, the foam has absorbance of 99.5% over the entire solar spectral range and low thermal conductivity (0.0077&#160;W K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) that effectively retains heat in the material and at the interface. After 3 months of continuous outdoor natural sunlight irradiation, the evaporator maintains a stable and durable evaporation rate. Moreover, the materials have good mechanical properties (7.48&#160;MPa young's modulus and 57.38% elongation at break) and excellent chemical resistance in 10 common organic solvents and aqueous solutions of pH = 1 to 14. This study provides a new system and strategy for desalination, steam power generation, treatment of polluted water and sewage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Spinel Cathode Materials: Navigating the Structural Evolution for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although significant progresses have been made in recent years, persistent misconceptions and disputes continue to haunt the investigation of high&#8208;voltage spinel oxides for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This review aims to unravel the intricacies of their crystallography, phase transitions, and electrochemical behaviors, thereby guiding future research endeavors.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel oxides are highly promising cobalt&#8208;free cathode materials to cater to the surging demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, commercial application of LNMOs is still challenging despite decades of research. To address the challenge, the understanding of their crystallography and structural evolutions during synthesis and electrochemical operation is critical. This review aims to illustrate and to update the fundamentals of crystallography, phase transition mechanisms, and electrochemical behaviors of LNMOs. First, the research history of LNMO and its development into a LIB cathode material is outlined. Then the structural basics of LNMOs including the classic and updated views of the crystal polymorphism, interconversion between the polymorphs, and structure&#8208;composition relationship is reviewed. Afterward, the phase transition mechanisms of LNMOs that connect structural and electrochemical properties are comprehensively discussed from fundamental thermodynamics to operando dynamics at intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;particle levels. In addition, phase evolutions during overlithiation as well as thermal&#8208;/electrochemical&#8208;driven phase transformations of LNMOs are also discussed. Finally, recommendations are offered for the further development of LNMOs as well as other complex materials to unlock their full potential for future sustainable and powerful batteries.

         <title>A Homochiral Porous Organic Cage&#8208;Polymer Membrane for Enantioselective Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an enantioselective porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based composite membrane using polyamide (PA) as a matrix is prepared via interfacial polymerization. The resultant CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes achieve chiral separation toward limonene racemates with enantiomeric excess values of 95.2% (R&#8208;enantiomers in excess) and a high flux of enantiomers of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based enantioselective separation is a promising method for chiral resolution due to its low cost and high efficiency. However, scalable fabrication of chiral separation membranes displaying both high enantioselectivity and high flux of enantiomers is still a challenge. Here, the authors report the preparation of homochiral porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based enantioselective thin&#8208;film&#8208;composite membranes using polyamide (PA) as the matrix, where fully organic and solvent&#8208;processable cage crystals have good compatibility with the polymer scaffold. The hierarchical CC3&#8208;R channels consist of chiral selective windows and inner cavities, leading to favorable chiral resolution and permeation of enantiomers; the CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes display an enantiomeric excess of 95.2% for R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene over S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene and a high flux of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the use of homochiral porous organic cages for preparing enantioselective membranes and demonstrates a new route for the development of next&#8208;generation chiral separation membranes.

         <title>Combination of Counterion Size and Doping Concentration Determines the Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically doped organic semiconductors display higher electrical conductivities with larger counterions at low doping concentrations due to decreased Coulomb interactions between counterions and charge carriers. In the high doping regime, the higher dielectric constant allows all charge carriers to be &#8220;free&#8221; regardless of counterion size and morphological disorder dominates the observed electrical conductivity.








Abstract
In both chemical and electrochemical doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs), a counterion, either from the electrolyte or ionized dopant, balances the charge introduced to the OSC. Despite the large influence of this counterion on OSC optical and electronic response, there remains substantial debate on how a fundamental parameter, ion size, impacts these properties. This work resolves much of this debate&#160;by accounting for two doping regimes. In the low&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies between charge carriers&#160;on the OSC and the counterions are significant, and larger counterions lead to decreased Coulomb interactions, more delocalized charge carriers, and higher electrical conductivities. In the high&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies become negligible due to the increased dielectric constant of the films and a smoothing of the energy landscape; thereby, the electrical conductivities depend primarily on the extent of morphological disorder in the OSC. Moreover, in regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), rr&#8208;P3HT, smaller counterions lead to greater bipolaron concentrations in the low&#8208;doping regime due to the increased Coulomb interactions. Emphasizing the impact of the counterion size, it is shown that larger counterions can lead to increased thermoelectric power factors for rr&#8208;P3HT.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;step Redox engineering strategy is employed to construct a 2D CoNi&#8208;carbon layer (2D&#8208;CNC), which showed superior reflection loss (RLmin) of &#8722;60.1 dB and wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 6.24 GHz. Moreover, the assembled multifunctional 3D aerogel device displayed excellent light&#8208;weight, pressure&#8208;resistant, anti&#8208;corrosion, heat&#8208;insulating and infrared&#8208;stealthy capabilities.








Abstract
2D layered metallic graphite composites are promising electromagnetic wave absorption materials (EWAMs) for their combined properties of abundant interlayer free spaces, rich metallic polarized sites, and high conductivity, but the controllable synthesis remains rather challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;step redox engineering strategy is developed by employing cobalt boron imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;BIF) to construct 2D CoNi&#8208;alloy embedded B, N&#8208;doped carbon layers (2D&#8208;CNC) as a promising EWAM. In the first step, a chemical etching oxidation process on Co&#8208;BIF is used to obtain an optimized 2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;layered double hydroxide (2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;LDH) intermediate and in the second, high&#8208;temperature calcination reduction is implemented to modify graphitization of the degree of the 2D&#8208;CNC. The obtained sample delivers superior reflection loss (RLmin) of &#8722;60.1&#160;dB and wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 6.24&#160;GHz. The synergy mechanisms of interfacial/dipole polarization and magnetic coupling are in&#8208;depth evidenced by the hologram and Lorentz electron microscopy, revealing its significant contribution on multireflection and impedance matching. Further theoretical evaluation by COMSOL simulation in different fields based on the dynamic loss process toward the test ring reveals the in situ EW attenuation process. This work presents a strategy to develop multifunctional light&#8208;weight infrared stealthy aerogel with superior pressure&#8208;resistant, anti&#8208;corrosion, and heat&#8208;insulating properties for future applications.

         <title>Boosting Upconversion Efficiency in Optically Inert Shelled Structures with Electroactive Membrane through Electron Donation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive membranes, derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 bacteria, are incorporated into membrane&#8208;integrated liposomes (MILs), encapsulating core&#8211;shell upconversion nanoparticles (CS UCNPs) with an optically inert shell. CS UCNP@MIL exhibits enhanced upconversion emission. This enhancement process is facilitated by electron donation from the electroactive membrane through the optically inactive shell to the UCNPs and is supported by theoretical calculations and experimental evidence.








Abstract
This study innovatively addresses challenges in enhancing upconversion efficiency in lanthanide&#8208;based nanoparticles (UCNPs) by exploiting Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, a microorganism capable of extracellular electron transfer. Electroactive membranes, rich in c&#8208;type cytochromes, are extracted from bacteria and integrated into membrane&#8208;integrated liposomes (MILs), encapsulating core&#8211;shelled UCNPs with an optically inactive shell, forming UCNP@MIL constructs. The electroactive membrane, tailored to donate electrons through the inert shell, independently boosts upconversion emission under near&#8208;infrared excitation (980 or 1550&#160;nm), bypassing ligand&#8208;sensitized UCNPs. The optically inactive shell restricts energy migration, emphasizing electroactive membrane electron donation. Density functional theory calculations elucidate efficient electron transfer due to the electroactive membrane hemes' highest occupied molecular orbital being higher than the valence band maximum of the optically inactive shell, crucial for enhancing energy transfer to emitter ions. The introduction of a SiO2 insulator coating diminishes light enhancement, underscoring the importance of unimpeded electron transfer. Luminescence enhancement remains resilient to variations in emitter or sensitizing ions, highlighting the robustness of the electron transfer&#8208;induced phenomenon. However, altering the inert shell material diminishes enhancement, emphasizing the role of electron transfer. This methodology holds significant promise for diverse biological applications. UCNP@MIL offers an advantage in cellular uptake, which proves beneficial for cell imaging.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with Exceeding 19% Efficiency via the Synergy of Polyfluoride Polymer and Fluorous Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluoropolymer PF7 is designed by branched fluorination in side chains. Due to fluorine&#8208;induced interactions, PF7 comprehensively outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer PM6 in photovoltaic properties. By combining with fluorous solvent vapor annealing, the device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 19.09%. The synergy of fluoropolymer and fluorous solvent exhibits an excellent universality.








Abstract
Rational molecular design and suitable device engineering are two important strategies to boost the efficiencies in organic solar cells (OSCs). Yet these two approaches are independently developed, while their synergy is believed to be more productive. Herein, a branched polyfluoride moiety, heptafluoroisopropoxyl group, is introduced into the side chains of conjugated polymers for the first time. Compared with the conventional alkyl chain, this polyfluoride chain can endow the resulting polymer namely PF7 with highly packing order and strong crystallinity owing to the strong polarization and fluorine&#8208;induced interactions, while good solubility and moderate miscibility are retained. As a result, PF7 comprehensively outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer PM6 in photovoltaic properties. More importantly, based on the solubility of heptafluoroisopropoxyl groups in fluorous solvents, a new post&#8208;treatment denoted as fluorous solvent vapor annealing (FSVA) is proposed to match PF7. Differing from the existing post&#8208;treatments, FSVA can selectively reorganize fluoropolymer molecules but less impact small molecules in blend films. By employing the synergy of fluoropolymer and fluorous solvent, the device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 19.09%, which is among the best efficiencies in binary OSCs. The polymer PF7 and the FSVA treatment exhibit excellent universality in various OSCs with different material combinations or device architectures.

         <title>A Hemoglobin Bionics&#8208;Based System for Combating Antibiotic Resistance in Chronic Diabetic Wounds via Iron Homeostasis Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hemoglobin bionics&#8208;based glucose/pH&#8208;responsive microneedle bandage, PDGa@GMB, is used for combating antibiotic resistance in chronic diabetic wounds. PDGa@GMB shows insusceptibility to genetic resistance with sustainable antimicrobial effects against both S. aureus and E. coli (&gt;95%) and accelerates tissue recovery (&lt;20 d). It holds tremendous potential for mediating microbial&#8208;host crosstalk, thereby synergistically attenuating pathogen virulence and pathogenicity.








Abstract
Owing to the increased tissue iron accumulation in patients with diabetes, microorganisms may activate high expression of iron&#8208;involved metabolic pathways, leading to the exacerbation of bacterial infections and disruption of systemic glucose metabolism. Therefore, an on&#8208;demand transdermal dosing approach that utilizes iron homeostasis regulation to combat antimicrobial resistance is a promising strategy to address the challenges associated with low administration bioavailability and high antibiotic resistance in treating infected diabetic wounds. Here, it is aimed to propose an effective therapy based on hemoglobin bionics to induce disturbances in bacterial iron homeostasis. The preferred &#8220;iron cargo&#8221; is synthesized by protoporphyrin IX chelated with dopamine and gallium (PDGa), and is delivered via a glucose/pH&#8208;responsive microneedle bandage (PDGa@GMB). The PDGa@GMB downregulates the expression levels of the iron uptake regulator (Fur) and the peroxide response regulator (perR) in Staphylococcus aureus, leading to iron nutrient starvation and oxidative stress, ultimately suppressing iron&#8208;dependent bacterial activities. Consequently, PDGa@GMB demonstrates insusceptibility to genetic resistance while maintaining sustainable antimicrobial effects (&gt;90%) against resistant strains of both S. aureus and E. coli, and accelerates tissue recovery (&lt;20 d). Overall, PDGa@GMB not only counteracts antibiotic resistance but also holds tremendous potential in mediating microbial&#8208;host crosstalk, synergistically attenuating pathogen virulence and pathogenicity.

         <title>Unconventional Band Structure via Combined Molecular Orbital and Lattice Symmetries in a Surface&#8208;Confined Metallated Graphdiyne Sheet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based monolayers represent the next generation two&#8208;dimensional (2D) carbon&#8208;rich materials with tunable structures and properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the detection of band formation in atomically thin GY/GDY analogues has been challenging, as both long&#8208;range order and atomic precision have to be fulfilled in the system. Here, we report direct evidence of band formation in on&#8208;surface synthesized metallated Ag&#8208;GDY sheets with mesoscopic (&#8764;1&#160;&#181;m) regularity. Employing scanning tunneling and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopies, energy&#8208;dependent transitions of real&#8208;space electronic states above the Fermi level and formation of the valence band are respectively observed. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate our observations and reveal that doubly degenerate frontier molecular orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close to the Fermi level. DFT modeling also indicates an intrinsic band gap for the pristine sheet material, which is retained for a bilayer with h&#8208;BN, whereas adsorption&#8208;induced in&#8208;gap electronic states evolve at the synthesis platform with Ag&#8208;GDY decorating the (111) facet of silver. These results illustrate the tremendous potential for engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries in atomically precise 2D carbon materials.

         <title>Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is probed by time&#8208;resolved two&#8208;photon photoemission (TR&#8208;TPPE) spectroscopy. We found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. We further argue that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point&#8208;like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for the Conversion of CO2 into High&#8208;Value C2+ Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added chemicals with two or more carbons (C2+) is a promising strategy that can not only mitigate the anthropogenic CO2 emissions but also reduce the excessive dependence on fossil feedstocks. In recent years, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs), including single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) and single&#8208;cluster catalysts (SCCs), emerged as the attractive candidates for CO2 fixation reactions due to their unique properties, such as the maximum utilization of active sites, tunable electronic structure, and the efficient elucidation of catalytic mechanism, etc. In this review, we provide an overview of significant progress in the synthesis and characterization of ADCs utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 towards high&#8208;value C2+ compounds. To provide insights for designing efficient ADCs towards the C2+ chemical synthesis originating from CO2, the key factors that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity are highlighted. Finally, the relevant challenges and opportunities are discussed to inspire new ideas for the generation of CO2&#8208;based C2+ products over ADCs.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic synaptic functions has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, we present a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step was achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) channels were successfully fabricated on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and were directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 seconds. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor was easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

         <title>Natural Hydrogels Support Kidney Organoid Generation and Promote in vitro Angiogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To date strategies aiming to modulate cell to extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions during organoid derivation remain largely unexplored. Here renal decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels are fabricated from porcine and human renal cortex as biomaterials to enrich cell&#8208;to&#8208;ECM crosstalk during the onset of kidney organoid differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Renal dECM&#8208;derived hydrogels are used in combination with hPSC&#8208;derived renal progenitor cells to define new approaches for 2D and 3D kidney organoid differentiation, demonstrating that in the presence of these biomaterials the resulting kidney organoids exhibit renal differentiation features, and the formation of an endogenous vascular component. Based on these observations, a new method to produce kidney organoids with vascular&#8208;like structures is achieved through the assembly of hPSC&#8208;derived endothelial&#8208;like organoids with kidney organoids in 3D. Major readouts of kidney differentiation and renal cell morphology are assessed exploiting these culture platforms as new models of nephrogenesis. Overall, this work shows that exploiting cell&#8208;to&#8208;ECM interactions during the onset of kidney differentiation from hPSCs facilitates and optimizes current approaches for kidney organoid derivation thereby increasing the utility of these unique culture cell platforms for personalized medicine.

         <title>Carbonated Beverage Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilize high upper cut&#8208;off voltages up to 4.8&#160;V versus lithium metal to reach extraordinary energy densities. Such a harsh environment challenges the cathode stability and requires the construction of robust cathode electrolyte interphases at their electrochemical interface. Inspired by carbonated beverages with supersaturated CO2, here we propose a surface modification strategy that produces effective passivation layer of low modulus from the weakest link. CO2 bubbles preferentially nucleate and grow at rough surfaces, which in oxide cathodes are also the local regions offering fast degradation pathway. Metal ion exchange on carbonated layer assist the construction of highly elastic interface under the guidance of packing factor. Our method enables surface reconstruction at both primary and secondary particle levels, for various cathodes exemplified by high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and LiCoO2. Remarkably, with ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8&#160;V versus Li+/Li, over 235 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity and over 900&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 discharge energy at cathode level, &#8764;90% capacity retention can be obtained for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C with commercial carbonate electrolytes. This carbonated beverage chemistry is promising for constructing high&#8208;quality surface passivation in many extreme&#8208;condition applications beyond battery cathodes.

         <title>Thermal Shock Synthesis for Loading Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanoclusters on Titanium Nitride as a Remarkable Electrocatalyst towards Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts embracing metal entities on suitable supports are profound in catalyzing various chemical reactions, and substantial synthetic endeavors in metal&#8208;support interaction modulation have been made to enhance catalytic performance. Here, it is reported the loading of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on titanium nitride support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via a special Ru&#8208;Ti interaction using high temperature shock (HTS) method. Direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process and short coalescence duration at ultrahigh temperatures contribute to the immobilization of Ru NCs on TiN support via producing the Ru&#8208;Ti interfacial perimeter. HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN shows remarkable activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, yielding ultralow overpotentials of 16.3 and 86.6&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The alkaline and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled using HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN yield 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.65 and 1.67&#160;V, respectively, which validate its applicability in hydrogen production industry. Theoretical simulations reveal the favorable formation of Ru&#8208;O and Ti&#8208;H bond at the interfacial perimeters between Ru NCs and TiN, which accelerates the prerequisite water dissociation kinetics for the enhanced HER activity. This exemplified work motivates the design of specific interfacial perimeters via the HTS strategy to improve the performance of diverse catalysis.

         <title>Photosensitizer&#8208;Amplified Antimicrobial Materials for Broad&#8208;spectrum Ablation of Resistant Pathogens in Ocular Infections</title>

Abstract
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug&#8208;resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens. In the present work, we have designed a new class of benzodiazole&#8208;paired materials as highly potent PDT agents with broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity upon illumination with non&#8208;toxic light. Our results mechanistically demonstrate that the energy transfer and electron transfer between non&#8208;photosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazole moieties embedded within pathogen&#8208;binding peptide sequences result in increased singlet oxygen generation and enhanced phototoxicity. Chemical optimization rendered PEP3 as a novel PDT agent with remarkable activity against MDR bacteria as well as pathogens at different stages of development (e.g., biofilms, spores, and fungal hyphae), which also proved effective in an ex vivo porcine model of microbial keratitis. The chemical modularity of this strategy and its general compatibility with peptide&#8208;based targeting agents will accelerate the design of highly photosensitive materials for antimicrobial PDT.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments could firmly anchor to the PQD surface thoroughly the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Writing Artificial Nervous System Based on Biosensor Integrated on Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The artificial nervous system proves the great potential for the emulation of complex neural signal transduction. However, a more bionic system design for bio&#8208;signal transduction still lags behind that of physical signals, and relies on additional external sources. Here, we present a zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio&#8208;source&#8208;sensing device (BSSD) for ion&#8208;based sensing and power generation with a hafnium&#8208;zirconium oxide&#8208;ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO&#8208;FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. The BSSD can use ion bio&#8208;source as both perception and energy source, and then output voltage signals varied with the change of ion concentrations to the HZO&#8208;FTJ, which completes the zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing neuromorphic bio&#8208;signal modulation. In view of in&#8208;/ex&#8208;vivo biocompatibility, we show the precise muscle control of a rabbit leg by integrating the ZANS with a flexible nerve stimulation electrode. The independence on external source enhances the application potential of ZANS in robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Non&#8208;Persistent Nano&#8208;Architectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing HPV+ head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long&#8208;time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post&#8208;treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard&#8208;dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, we demonstrate that a new model of non&#8208;persistent gold nano&#8208;architectures containing cisplatin (NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor&#8208;reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persisted for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NPs&#8208;based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, our 
data support the exploiting of non&#8208;persistent metal nanomaterials mediated approaches for oral cancer management.

         <title>Full&#8208;Space Electric Field in Mo&#8208;Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H2 fuel and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, we overcome this limitation by inducing the full&#8208;space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5 (Mo&#8208;Zn2In2S5) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full&#8208;space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn2In2S5. Notably, the optimized Mo1.5&#8208;Zn2In2S5 catalyst achieves exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn2S4 by 3.83&#8208; and 4.15&#8208;fold. Our findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Protocell Flow Reactors for Enzyme and Whole&#8208;cell Mediated Biocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors&#160;comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction&#8208;diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors could offer new opportunities in reactor design and application.&#160;Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of&#160;protocell&#8208;based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole&#8208;cell mediated biocatalysis. We employ semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single&#8208; or multiple&#8208;step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria&#8208;containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, we demonstrate a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme&#8208;mediated L&#8208;DOPA synthesis and whole&#8208;cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions. We show that the protocell&#8208;nested enzymes and bacterial cells&#160;exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non&#8208;encapsulated counterparts. Our results provide a step towards the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.

By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria-containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, we demonstrate a facile, cost-effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme-mediated L-DOPA synthesis and whole-cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions. We show that the protocell-nested enzymes and bacterial cells&#160;exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non-encapsulated counterparts. Our results provide a step towards the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell-like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Binary&#8208;Phase on Structural Stability of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emergence of layered sodium transition metal oxides featuring a multiphase structure presents a promising approach for cathode materials in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), showcasing notably improved energy storage capacity. However, the advancement of cathodes with multiphase structures faces obstacles due to the limited understanding of the integrated structural effects. Herein, we comprehend the integrated structural effects by an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;chemistry analysis in the developed layered cathode system NaxCu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 with purposely designed P2/O3 phase integration. Our results affirmed that integrated phase ratio plays a pivotal role in electrochemical/structural stability, particularly at high voltage and with the incorporation of anionic redox. In contrast to previous reports advocating solely for the enhanced electrochemical performance in biphasic structures, we demonstrated an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) results, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) computations further confirm the biphasic structure with P2:O3 = 4:6 shows suppressed irreversible phase transition at high desodiated states and thus exhibits optimized electrochemical performance. These fundamental discoveries provide clues to the design of high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Tunable and Reversible Adhesive of Liquid Metal Ferrofluid Pillars for Magnetically Actuated Non&#8208;Contact Transfer Printing</title>

Abstract
Transfer printing techniques based on tunable and reversible adhesives enable the heterogeneous integration of materials in desired layouts and are essential for developing both existing and envisioned electronic systems. Here, w e report a novel tunable and reversible adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars for developing an efficient magnetically actuated non&#8208;contact transfer printing. The liquid metal ferrofluid pillars offer the appealing advantages of gentle contact force by minimizing the preload effect and exceptional shape adaptability by maximizing the interfacial contact area due to their inherent fluidity, thus enabling a reliable damage&#8208;free pickup. Moreover, the liquid metal ferrofluid pillars harness the rapid stiffness increase and shape change with the magnetic field, generating an instantaneous ejection force to achieve a receiver&#8208;independent non&#8208;contact printing. Demonstrations of the adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars in transfer printing of diverse objects with different shapes, materials and dimensions onto various substrates illustrate its great potential in deterministic assembly.

         <title>Novel Palladium Hydride Surface Enabling Simultaneous Bacterial Killing and Osteogenic Formation through Proton Capturing and Activation of Antioxidant System in Immune Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving bacterial killing and osteogenic formation on an implant surface rarely occurs. In this study, we introduce a novel surface design&#8211;a palladium hydride (PdHx) film that enables these two distinct features to coexist. The PdHx lattice captures protons in the extracellular microenvironment of bacteria, disrupting their normal metabolic activities, such as ATP synthesis, nutrient co&#8208;transport, and oxidative stress. This disruption leads to significant bacterial death, as evidenced by RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, the unique enzymatic activity and hydrogen&#8208;loading properties of PdHx activate the human antioxidant system, resulting in the rapid clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This process reshapes the osteogenic immune microenvironment, promoting accelerated osteogenesis. Our findings reveal that the downregulation of the NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway is critical for activating immune cells toward M2 phenotype polarization. This novel surface design provides new strategies for modifying implant coatings to simultaneously prevent bacterial infection, reduce inflammation, and enhance tissue regeneration, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field of advanced materials.

         <title>Design of Fluorinated Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries Operating at Low Temperature and High Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated elastomeric electrolyte formed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation exhibits excellent ionic conductivity, mechanical resilience, and an ability to form stable interfaces at low temperatures, offering superior electrochemical performances of low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage operating solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
This work demonstrates the low&#8208;temperature operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) through the development of a fluorinated and plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;embedded elastomeric electrolyte (F&#8208;PCEE). The F&#8208;PCEE is formed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation between the polymer matrix and plastic crystal phase, offering a high mechanical strain (&#8776;300%) and ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.23 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C. Notably, strong phase separation between two phases leads to the selective distribution of lithium (Li) salts within the plastic crystal phase, enabling superior elasticity and high ionic conductivity at low temperatures. The F&#8208;PCEE in a Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell maintains 74.4% and 42.5% of discharge capacity at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively, compared to that at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the full cell exhibits 85.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C and a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, representing one of the highest cycling performances among the reported solid polymer electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature LMBs. This work attributes the prolonged cycling lifetime of F&#8208;PCEE at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C to the great mechanical robustness to suppress the Li&#8208;dendrite growth and ability to form superior LiF&#8208;rich interphases. This study establishes the design strategies of elastomeric electrolytes for developing solid&#8208;state LMBs operating at low temperatures and high voltages.

         <title>Dipole Moment Influences the Reversibility and Corrosion of Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must have both long cycle life and calendar life to be commercially viable. However, &#8220;trial and error&#8221; methodologies remains prevalent in contemporary research endeavors to identify favorable electrolytes. Here, we propose a guiding principle for the selection of solvents for LMBs, which aims to achieve high coulombic efficiency while minimizing the corrosion. For the first time, our study reveals the dipole moment and orientation of solvent molecules have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influences the solid electrolyte interphase. Using this principle, we demonstrate the use of LiNO3 as the sole salt in NCM811/Li cells can achieve excellent cycling stability. Overall, our work bridges the molecular structure of solvents to the reversibility and corrosion of lithium metal, and these concepts can be extended to other metal&#8208;based batteries.

Abstract
A broad range of chemical transformations driven by catalytic processes necessitate the electron transfer between catalyst and substrate. The redox cycle limitation arising from the inequivalent electron donation and acceptance of the involved catalysts, however, generally leads to their deactivation, causing substantial economic losses and environmental risks. Here we provide a &#8220;non&#8208;redox catalysis&#8221; strategy wherein the catalytic units were constructed by atomic Fe and B as dual active sites to create tensile force and electric field, which allowed directional self&#8208;decomposition of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) molecules through internal electron transfer to form singlet oxygen, bypassing the need of electron transfer between catalyst and PMS. The proposed catalytic approach with non&#8208;redox cycling of catalyst contributed to excellent stability of the active centers, while the generated reactive oxygen species found high efficiency in long&#8208;term catalytic pollutant degradation and selective organic oxidation synthesis in aqueous phase. This work offers new avenue for directional substrate conversion, which holds promise to advance the design of alternative catalytic pathways for sustainable energy conversion and valuable chemical production.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptive Microdrugs Enhance the Chemotherapy of Malignant Glioma: Beyond Their Nanodrugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery systems are usually confined to nanoscale due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, they remain a great challenge for malignant glioma chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery efficiency and insufficient tumor penetration resulting from the blood&#8208;brain barrier/blood&#8208;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Inspired by biological microparticles (e.g., cells) with excellent adaptive deformation, we demonstrate that the adaptive microdrugs (even up to 3.0&#160;&#956;m in size) are more efficient than their nanodrugs (less than 200&#160;nm in size) to cross BBB/BBTB and penetrate into tumor tissues, achieving highly efficient chemotherapy of malignant glioma. The distinct delivery of the adaptive microdrugs is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial binding and endocytosis via adaptive deformation. As expected, the obtained adaptive microdrugs exhibited enhanced accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into tumor tissues in comparison with nanodrugs, significantly improving the survival rate of glioblastoma mice. We believe that the bioinspired adaptive microdrugs enable them to efficiently cross physiological barriers and deeply penetrate tumor tissues for drug delivery, providing an avenue for the treatment of solid tumors.

         <title>Mismatched Supramolecular Interactions Facilitate the Reprocessing of Super&#8208;Strong and Ultra&#8208;Tough Thermoset Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoset elastomers have been extensively applied in many fields because of their excellent mechanical strengths and durable characteristics, such as an excellent chemical resistance. However, in the context of environmental issues, the non&#8208;recyclability of thermosets has become a major barrier to the further development of these materials. Here, we report a well&#8208;tailored strategy to solve this problem by introducing mismatched supramolecular interactions (MMSIs) into a covalently cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network with dynamic acylsemicarbazide moieties. The MMSIs significantly strengthen and toughen the thermoset elastomer by effectively dissipating energy and resisting external stress. In addition, the elastomer recycling efficiency is improved 2.7&#8208;fold due to the superior reversibility of the MMSIs. The optimized thermoset elastomer, i.e., SPUUN&#8208;IE, features outstanding characteristics, including an ultra&#8208;high tensile strength (110.8&#160;MPa), an unprecedented tensile toughness (1245.2&#160;MJ m&#8211;3), as well as remarkable resistance to chemical media, creep, and damage. Most importantly, SPUUN&#8208;IE exhibits an extraordinary multi&#8208;recyclability, and the 4th recycling efficiency remains close to 100%. This scalable method promotes the development of thermosets with both high performance and excellent recyclability, thereby providing valuable guidance for addressing the issue of non&#8208;recyclability from a molecular design standpoint.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many industrial chemical processes, including for producing fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental controls, employ heterogeneous solid state catalysts at elevated temperatures in gas or liquid environments. Dynamic reactions at the atomic level play a critical role in catalyst stability and functionality. In&#8208;situ visualization and analysis of atomic&#8208;scale processes in real time under controlled reaction environments can provide important insights into practical frameworks to improve catalytic processes and materials. This review focuses on innovative real time in&#8208;situ EM methods, including recent progress in analytical in&#8208;situ environmental (scanning) transmission EM (ESTEM and ETEM) with single atom resolution for visualizing dynamic single atom catalysis under controlled flowing gas reaction environments. ESTEM studies of single atom dynamics of reactions, and of sintering deactivation, contribute to a better&#8208;informed understanding of the yield and stability of catalyst operations. Advances in in&#8208;situ technologies, including gas and liquid sample holders, nano&#8208;tomography and higher voltages, as well as challenges and opportunities in tracking reacting atoms, are highlighted. The findings show that the understanding and application of fundamental processes in catalysis can be improved, with valuable economic, environmental, and societal benefits.

         <title>3D Conjugated Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D hole transporting material termed FTPE&#8208;ST is reported, which has a large conjugated structure leading to high hole mobility, and sulfur atoms that can bind to coordinately unsaturated lead centers on the surface of perovskite films, enhancing interfacial interactions. Perovskite solar cells and modules incorporating FTPE&#8208;ST achieve power conversion efficiencies of 25.21 and 21.27%, respectively.








Abstract
The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N, N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamino)&#8722;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#160;imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film&#8208;forming capability. However, inherently weak intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel HTM, termed FTPE&#8208;ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo(g,p)chrysene core and coplanar 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, is designed to enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) configuration provides the material multi&#8208;direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2&#8208;methylanisole, and its large conjugated backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility. Moreover, the sulfur donors in EDOT units coordinate with lead ions on the perovskite surface, leading to stronger interfacial interactions and the suppression of defects at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing FTPE&#8208;ST achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21% with excellent long&#8208;time stability, one of the highest PCEs for non&#8208;spiro HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. In addition, the excellent film&#8208;forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE&#8208;ST&#8208;based large&#8208;scale PSCs (1.0&#160;cm2) and modules (29.0&#160;cm2), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;AIE Nanofibers Functionalized Sutures with Antimicrobial Activity and Subcutaneous Traceability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial suture is developed involving peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers. The suture demonstrates robust fluorescence and antimicrobial activity, along with excellent hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, it effectively prevents MRSA infection and enhances healing, surpassing the performance of the commercial Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Furthermore, it displays subcutaneous traceability, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of degradation.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used medical devices, sutures face challenges related to surgical site infections (SSIs) and lack of subcutaneous traceability. In the present study, a facile and effective approach using peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers (NFs&#8208;K18) to create fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial sutures, which have been applied to four commercially available sutures is developed. The functionalized sutures of PGAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 and PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibit fluorescence with excellent penetration from 4&#160;mm chicken breasts. They also demonstrate remarkable stability after 24&#160;h of white light illumination and threading through chicken breasts 10 times. These sutures efficiently generate ROS, resulting in significant suppression of four clinical bacteria, with the highest antimicrobial rate of &#8776;100%. Moreover, the sutures exhibit favorable hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the optimized PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 suture displays potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA, effectively inhibiting inflammation and promoting tissue healing in both skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, outperforming the commercially available Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Importantly, PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibits sensitive subcutaneous traceability, allowing for accurate in situ monitoring of its degradation. It is believed that this straightforward strategy offers a new pathway for inhibiting SSIs and monitoring the status of sutures.

In skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, it effectively prevents MRSA infection and enhances healing, surpassing the performance of the commercial Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Furthermore, it displays subcutaneous traceability, enabling real-time monitoring of degradation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the most widely used medical devices, sutures face challenges related to surgical site infections (SSIs) and lack of subcutaneous traceability. In the present study, a facile and effective approach using peptide-AIE nanofibers (NFs-K18) to create fluorescent-traceable antimicrobial sutures, which have been applied to four commercially available sutures is developed. The functionalized sutures of PGAS-NFs-K18 and PGLAS-NFs-K18 exhibit fluorescence with excellent penetration from 4&#160;mm chicken breasts. They also demonstrate remarkable stability after 24&#160;h of white light illumination and threading through chicken breasts 10 times. These sutures efficiently generate ROS, resulting in significant suppression of four clinical bacteria, with the highest antimicrobial rate of &#8776;100%. Moreover, the sutures exhibit favorable hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the optimized PGLAS-NFs-K18 suture displays potent antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;MRSA&lt;/i&gt;, effectively inhibiting inflammation and promoting tissue healing in both skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, outperforming the commercially available Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Importantly, PGLAS-NFs-K18 exhibits sensitive subcutaneous traceability, allowing for accurate in situ monitoring of its degradation. It is believed that this straightforward strategy offers a new pathway for inhibiting SSIs and monitoring the status of sutures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conducting CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;&#8212;the undesired reaction between CO2 and electrolyte OH&#8722;, aiming to provide a high carbon utilization. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, including mechanism elucidation, catalyst design, and device&#8208;level engineering. Challenges and future directions are highlighted to shed light on its further development. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable energy provides a promising route to CO2 conversion and utilization. However, the widely used neutral/alkaline electrolyte consumes a large amount of CO2 to produce (bi)carbonate byproducts, leading to significant challenges at the device level, thereby impeding the further deployment of this reaction. Conducting CO2RR in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;; however, it presents inherent difficulties due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, necessitating concerted efforts toward advanced catalyst and electrode designs to achieve high selectivity and activity. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, from mechanism elucidation to catalyst design and device engineering. This review begins by discussing the mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathway, laying the foundation for catalyst design in acidic CO2RR. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent advancements in acidic CO2RR catalysts is provided, highlighting heterogeneous catalysts, surface immobilized molecular catalysts, and catalyst surface enhancement. Furthermore, the progress made in device&#8208;level applications is summarized, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance acidic CO2RR systems. Finally, the existing challenges and future directions in the design of acidic CO2RR catalysts are outlined, emphasizing the need for improved selectivity, activity, stability, and scalability.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Crystalline Core&#8208;Shell Guanine Spherulites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique architecture of core&#8208;shell spherulites, composed of highly birefringent and ordered crystalline organic subunits, formed in the eyes of aquatic organisms, exhibits extraordinary light scattering properties with no synthetic equivalent. A ternary emulsification process is developed to produce bioinspired core&#8208;shell spherulites of self&#8208;assembled guanine platelets, with an estimated birefringence of &#8776;25%.








Abstract
Spherical particles with diameters within the wavelength of visible light, known as spherulites, manipulate light uniquely due to their spatial organization and their structural birefringence. Most of the known crystalline spherulites are branched, and composed of metals, alloys, and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers. Recently, a different spherulite architecture is discovered in the vision systems of decapod crustaceans &#8208; core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of highly birefringent (&#916;n&#8776;30%$\Delta n \approx \ 30\%$) organic single&#8208;crystal platelets, with exceptional optical properties. These metastructures, which efficiently scatter light even in dense aqueous environments, have no synthetic equivalence and serve as a natural proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as well as synthetic inspiration for thin scattering media. Here, the synthesis of core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of guanine crystal platelets ((&#916;n&#8776;25%$\Delta n \approx 25\%$) is presented in a two&#8208;step emulsification process in which a water/oil/water emulsion and induced pH changes are used to promote interfacial crystallization. Carboxylic acids neutralize the dissolved guanine salts to form spherulites composed of single, radially stacked, &#946;&#8208;guanine platelets, which are oriented tangentially to the spherulite surface. Using Mie theory calculations and forward scattering measurements from single spherulites, it is found that due to the single&#8208;crystal properties and orientation, the synthetic spherulites possess a high tangential refractive index, similarly to biogenic&#160;particles.

         <title>Vacuum Thermoforming of Optically Switchable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Spherical Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the industrially&#8208;relevant process of vacuum thermoforming may be applied to thermoplastic liquid crystal elastomers to form centimeter&#8208;scale hemispheres capable of reversible actuation and striking changes in transparency upon heating: simulations predict the resulting mesogenic alignment generated by the process. Demonstrators are presented including &#8220;surfing&#8221; boats driven by infrared light and complete spheres formed by bonding two hemispheres.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are generally limited in shape, size, and quantity by the need for aligning via stretching and fixing via photopolymerizing. A thermoplastic LCE is presented that may be vacuum thermoformed into centimeter&#8208;sized hemispheres. The scalable industrial process induces LCE alignment without requiring postfixing. The hemispheres display remarkable properties, actuating with strains around 20% and transitioning from opaque and scattering to highly translucent upon heating: both the physical and optical effects are fully reversible. Simulations reveal the LCE experiences biaxial strains during processing, the magnitude varying as a function of location on the hemisphere: the resulting alignment describing the hemisphere actuation well. The thermoplastic LCE hemispheres may be combined to form complete spheres by simply heating the joint. The hemisphere can also be physically deformed into a ball which can then unfold back into the hemisphere again. By doping the hemispheres with photoswitches, fluorescent or photothermal dyes, devices are formed for light collection and redistribution, addressable water containers that may pour at will, and light&#8208;responsive surfing devices. This is the first example of an LCE amenable to high&#8208;volume industrial vacuum thermoforming which may lead to intricate 3D&#8208;shaped actuators with new functional properties.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Interlayer Strategy for Modulating NiCoP&#8208;Based Heterostructure toward High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bismuth&#8208;nickel cobalt phosphide (CC/Bi&#8208;NCP) heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields are fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high&#8208;load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The developed dual&#8208;role interlayer strategy considers both the effects of the interlayer on the outer layer preparation process and the electrochemical performance of the heterostructure.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc (Zn) batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Novel bismuth-nickel cobalt phosphide (CC/Bi-NCP) heterostructures with built-in electric fields are fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high-load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The developed dual-role interlayer strategy considers both the effects of the interlayer on the outer layer preparation process and the electrochemical performance of the heterostructure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel-cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc (Zn) batteries. However, the actual specific capacitance and rate capability of NCPs require further improvement, which can be achieved through reasonable heterostructural design and loading conditions of active materials on substrates. Herein, novel hierarchical Bi-NCP heterogeneous structures with built-in electric fields consisting of bismuth (Bi) interlayers (electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC)) are designed and fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high-load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The resulting CC/Bi-NCP electrodes show a uniform, continuous, and high mass loading (&amp;gt;3.5&#160;mg) with a superior capacitance reaching 1200 F&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4129 mF&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; combined with high-rate capability and durable cyclic stability.

         <title>KIr4O8 Nanowires with Rich Hydroxyl Promote Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyl&#8208;rich KIr4O8 nanowires catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction via a modified adsorbate evolution mechanism and optimal proximity between Ir (d) and O (p) band center, showing high performance and long&#8208;term stability in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and insufficient catalytic performance over the corresponding Ir&#8208;based catalysts are still enormous challenges in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, it is reported that KIr4O8 nanowires anode catalyst with more exposed active sites and rich hydroxyl achieves a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.68&#160;V and possesses excellent catalytic stability with 1230&#160;h in PEMWE. Combining in situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy results, the modified adsorbate evolution mechanism is proposed, wherein the rich hydroxyl in the inherent structure of KIr4O8 nanowires directly participates in the catalytic process for favoring the OER. Density functional theory calculation results further suggest that the enhanced proximity between Ir (d) and O (p) band center in KIr4O8 can strengthen the covalence of Ir&#8211;O, facilitate the electron transfer between adsorbents and active sites, and decrease the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step from OH* to O* during the OER.

         <title>Thickness of Nano&#8208;Scale Poly(Dimethylsiloxane) Layers Determines the Motion of Sliding Water Drops</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layers of nanometer thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are applied as hydrophobic coatings because of their environmentally&#8208;friendly and chemically&#8208;inert properties. In applications such as heat exchangers or fog harvesting, low water drop friction on surfaces is required. While the onset of motion (static friction) has been studied, our knowledge of dynamic friction needs to be improved. Which processes lead to energy dissipation and cause dynamic friction? This knowledge is important to minimize friction. Here, we measured the dynamic friction of drops on PDMS brushes of different thicknesses, covering the whole available velocity regime. The brush thickness L turned out to be a predictor for drop friction. 4&#8211;5&#160;nm thick PDMS brush showed the lowest dynamic friction. A certain minimal thickness is necessary to form homogeneous surfaces and reduce the attractive Van der Waals interaction between water and the substrate. The increase in dynamic friction above L = 5&#160;nm is also attributed to the increasing viscoelastic dissipation of the capillary ridge formed at the contact line. The height of the ridge is related to the brush thickness. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force measurements support this interpretation. Sum&#8208;frequency generation further indicates a maximum order at the PDMS&#8208;water interface at intermediate thickness.

Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), a skin&#8208;like wearable electronic device, holds great promise in the fields of telemedicine and personalized healthcare because of its good flexibility, biocompatibility, skin conformability, and sensing performance. E&#8208;skin can monitor various health indicators of the human body in real time and over the long term, including physical indicators (exercise, respiration, blood pressure, etc.) and chemical indicators (saliva, sweat, urine, etc.). In recent years, the development of various materials, analysis, and manufacturing technologies has promoted significant development of e&#8208;skin, laying the foundation for the application of next&#8208;generation wearable medical technologies and devices. Herein, we discuss the properties required for e&#8208;skin health monitoring devices to achieve long&#8208;term and precise monitoring and summarize several detectable indicators in the health monitoring field. Subsequently, the applications of integrated e&#8208;skin health monitoring systems are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future development directions in this field are discussed. This review is expected to generate great interest and inspiration for the development and improvement of e&#8208;skin and health monitoring systems.

         <title>In Situ Preparation of Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Thin Films with Atomically Flat Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since their discovery, the infinite&#8208;layer nickelates have been regarded as an appealing system for gaining deeper insights into high temperature superconductivity (HTSC). However, the synthesis of superconducting samples has been proved to be challenging. Here, we&#160;develop an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in situ reduction method using atomic hydrogen as reducing agent and apply it in lanthanum nickelate system. The reduction parameters, including the reduction temperature (TR) and hydrogen pressure (PH), are systematically explored. We&#160;found that the reduction window for achieving superconducting transition is quite wide, reaching nearly 80&#176;C in TR and 3 orders of magnitude in PH when the reduction time is set to 30 mins. And there exists an optimal PH for achieving the highest Tc if both TR and reduction time are fixed. More prominently, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the atomically flat surface can be preserved during the in situ reduction process, providing advantages over the ex situ CaH2 method for surface&#8208;sensitive experiments.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Cationic Pyridine Sites in Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are gaining attention as energy storage devices due to their high energy density, low&#8208;cost, and inherent safety. However, poor cycling performance of these batteries always arise from the severe leakage and shuttle effect of polyiodides (I3&#8211; and I5&#8211;). Herein, a novel cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB) is developed to capture and confine iodine (I2) species via strong electrostatic interaction, making it an attractive host for I2 in ZIBs. The as&#8208;fabricated ZIBs with I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB (I2@CCTF&#8208;TPMB) cathode achieve a large specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 and an exceptionally stable cyclic performance, retaining 93.9% of its capacity over 30, 000 cycles at 5 A g&#8211;1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZIBs can be attributed to the pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites of CCTF&#8208;TPMB, which effectively suppress the leakage and shuttle of polyiodides, while also accelerating conversion reaction of I2 species. Combined in situ Raman and Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible analysis, along with theoretical calculations, clearly reveal the critical role played by pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites in boosting the ZIBs performances. This work opens up a promising pathway for designing advanced I2 cathode materials toward next&#8208;generation ZIBs and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are gaining attention as energy storage devices due to their high energy density, low-cost, and inherent safety. However, poor cycling performance of these batteries always arise from the severe leakage and shuttle effect of polyiodides (I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, a novel cationic pyridine-rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF-TPMB) is developed to capture and confine iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) species via strong electrostatic interaction, making it an attractive host for I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ZIBs. The as-fabricated ZIBs with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded CCTF-TPMB (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@CCTF-TPMB) cathode achieve a large specific capacity of 243 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an exceptionally stable cyclic performance, retaining 93.9% of its capacity over 30, 000 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZIBs can be attributed to the pyridine-rich cationic sites of CCTF-TPMB, which effectively suppress the leakage and shuttle of polyiodides, while also accelerating conversion reaction of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species. Combined in situ Raman and Ultraviolet-Visible analysis, along with theoretical calculations, clearly reveal the critical role played by pyridine-rich cationic sites in boosting the ZIBs performances. This work opens up a promising pathway for designing advanced I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode materials toward next-generation ZIBs and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Responsive Nonporous Adaptive Crystals Derived from Pyridinium Hydrochloride and the Application in Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) are crystalline nonporous materials that can undergo a structural adaptive phase transformation to accommodate specific guest via porous cavity or lattice voids. Most of the NACs are based on pillararenes because of their flexible backbone and intrinsic porous structure. Here we report a readily prepared organic hydrochloride of 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium chloride (TPAPyH), exhibiting the solvent dimension&#8208;dependent adaptive crystallinity. Wherein it forms a nonporous &#945; crystal in a solvent with larger dimensions, while forming two porous &#946; and &#947; crystals capable of accommodating solvent molecules in solvent with small size. Furthermore, the thermal&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition from the &#946; to &#945; phase can be initiated. Upon exposure to iodine vapor or immersion in aqueous solution, the nonporous &#945; phase transforms to porous &#946; phase by adsorbing iodine molecules. Owing to the formation of trihalide anion I2Cl&#713; within the crystal cavity, TPAPyH exhibits remarkable performance in iodine storage, with a high uptaking capacity of 1.27 g&#183;g&#8722;1 and elevated iodine desorption temperature of up to 110 and 82&#160;&#176;C following the first and second adsorption stage. The unexpected adaptivity of TPAPyH inspired the design of NACs for selective adsorption and separation of volatile compound from organic small molecules.

         <title>Planar Chlorination Engineering: A Strategy of Completely Breaking the Geometric Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 Site for Boosting Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site was firstly proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49&#160;mV and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe&#8208;N4/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst also had excellent stability for 25,000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn&#8208;air battery test, the Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst had the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW/cm2 and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8208;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrated the adjacent C&#8208;Cl bond effectively broke the symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site, downward shifted the d&#8208;band center of Fe, facilitated the reduction and release of OH*, and remarkably lower the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. This work revealed the enormous potentials of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.

         <title>Wearable Aptalyzer Integrates Microneedle and Electrochemical Sensing for in Vivo Monitoring of Glucose and Lactate in live Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomarkers within the interstitial fluid (ISF) using microneedle (MN)&#8208;based assays, has the potential to transform healthcare. This study introduces the Wearable Aptalyzer, an integrated system fabricated by combining biocompatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN) arrays for ISF extraction with an electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor for in situ monitoring of blood analytes. The use of aptamers enables continuous monitoring of a wide range of analytes, beyond what is possible with enzymatic monitoring. The Wearable Aptalyzer is used for real&#8208;time and multiplexed monitoring of glucose and lactate in ISF. Validation experiments using live mice and rat models of Type 1 Diabetes demonstrate strong correlation between the measurements collected from the Wearable Aptalyzer in ISF and those obtained from gold&#8208;standard techniques for blood glucose and lactate, for each analyte alone and in combination. The Wearable Aptalyzer effectively addresses the limitations inherent in enzymatic detection methods as well as solid MN biosensors and addresses the need for reliable and multiplexed bioanalytical monitoring in vivo.

         <title>Deterministic Fabrication and Quantum&#8208;Well Modulation of Phase&#8208;Pure 2D Perovskite Heterostructures for Encrypted Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Deterministic integration of phase&#8208;pure Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites has great significance for realizing functional optoelectronic devices. However, precise fabrications of artificial perovskite heterostructures with pristine interfaces and rational design over electronic structure configurations remain a challenge. Here, the controllable synthesis of large&#8208;area ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline RP perovskite nanosheets and the deterministic fabrication of arbitrary 2D vertical perovskite heterostructures are reported. The 2D heterostructures exhibit intriguing dual&#8208;peak emission phenomenon and dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic. Importantly, the interlayer energy transfer behaviors from wide&#8208;bandgap component (WBC) to narrow&#8208;bandgap component (NBC) modulated by comprising quantum wells are thoroughly revealed. Functional nanoscale photodetectors are further constructed based on the 2D heterostructures. Moreover, by combining the modulated dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic with double&#8208;beam irradiation modes, and introducing an encryption algorithm mechanism, a light communication system with high security and reliability is achieved. This work can greatly promote the developments of heterogeneous integration technologies of 2D perovskites, and could provide a competitive candidate for advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Organic Solvent Boosts Charge Storage and Charging Dynamics of Conductive MOF Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) and ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as auspicious combinations for high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. However, the nanoconfinement from c&#8208;MOFs and high viscosity of ILs slow down the charging process. This hindrance can, however, be resolved by adding solvent. Here, we performed constant&#8208;potential molecular simulations to scrutinize the solvent impact on charge storage and charging dynamics of MOF&#8208;IL&#8208;based supercapacitors. We find conditions for &gt;100% enhancement in capacity and &#8764;6 times increase in charging speed. These improvements were confirmed by synthesizing near&#8208;ideal c&#8208;MOFs and developing multiscale models linking molecular simulations to electrochemical measurements. Fundamentally, our findings elucidate that the solvent acts as an &#8220;ionophobic agent&#8221; to induce a substantial enhancement in charge storage, and as an &#8220;ion traffic police&#8221; to eliminate convoluted counterion and co&#8208;ion motion paths and create two distinct ion transport highways to accelerate charging dynamics. This work paves the way for the optimal design of MOF supercapacitors.

         <title>Progress and Perspective toward Continuous&#8208;Wave Organic Solid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic solid&#8208;state laser under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation is one of the most challenging areas in organic optoelectronics. Recent advances in long&#8208;pulsed organic lasers are comprehensively summarized with respect to molecular designs, optical&#8208;resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet&#8208;contribution strategies. Future directions and perspectives for CW operation are discussed.








Abstract
A continuous&#8208;wave (CW) organic solid&#8208;state laser is highly desirable for spectroscopy, sensing, and communications, but is a significant challenge in optoelectronics. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons and relevant excited&#8208;state absorptions, as well as singlet&#8211;triplet annihilation, are the main obstacles to CW lasing. Here, progress in singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;state utilizations in organic gain media is reviewed to reveal the issues in working with triplets. Then, exciton behaviors that inhibit light oscillations during long excitation pulses are discussed. Further, recent advances in increasing organic lasing pulse widths from microseconds toward the indication of CW operation are summarized with respect to molecular designs, advanced resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet contribution strategies. Finally, future directions and perspectives are proposed for achieving stable CW organic lasers with significant triplet contribution.

         <title>Direct Integration of Perovskite Solar Cells with Carbon Fiber Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of thin&#8208;film photovoltaics with structural components represents an attractive prospect for mobile power applications. In this work, the first example of perovskite solar cells deposited directly onto rigid carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composite substrates is demonstrated, heralding a new class of photocurrent&#8208;generating materials with both high specific strength and power.








Abstract
Integrating photovoltaic devices onto the surface of carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates should create materials with high mechanical strength that are also able to generate electrical power. Such devices are anticipated to find ready applications as structural, energy&#8208;harvesting systems in both the automotive and aeronautical sectors. Here, the fabrication of triple&#8208;cation perovskite n&#8211;i&#8211;p solar cells onto the surface of planarized carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates is demonstrated, with devices utilizing a transparent top ITO contact. These devices also contain a &#8220;wrinkled&#8221; SiO2 interlayer placed between the device and substrate that alleviates thermally induced cracking of the bottom ITO layer. Devices are found to have a maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency of 14.5% and a specific power (power per weight) of 21.4&#160;W&#160;g&#8722;1 (without encapsulation), making them highly suitable for mobile power applications.

         <title>Understanding Effects of Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Density on Polaron Formation Via Electrochemical Doping in Thiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping. In situ monitoring of polaron formation allows identification of its dependence on molecular structures. Understanding of the polaron formation mechanism is important for molecular design rules and its impact on electrical properties.








Abstract
Polarons exist when charges are injected into organic semiconductors due to their strong coupling with the lattice phonons, significantly affecting electronic charge&#8208;transport properties. Understanding the formation and (de)localization of polarons is therefore critical for further developing organic semiconductors as a future electronics platform. However, there are very few studies reported in this area. In particular, there is no direct in situ monitoring of polaron formation and identification of its dependence on molecular structure and impact on electrical properties, limiting further advancement in organic electronics. Herein, how a minor modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping, changing the polymers&#8217; electrical response to the surrounding dielectric environment for gas sensing, is demonstrated. It is found that the reduction in side&#8208;chain density results in a multistep polaron formation, leading to an initial formation of localized polarons in thiophene units without side chains. Reduced side&#8208;chain density also allows the formation of a high density of polarons with fewer polymer structural changes. More numerous but more localized polarons generate a stronger analyte response but without the selectivity between polar and non&#8208;polar solvents, which is different from the more delocalized polarons that show clear selectivity. The results provide important molecular understanding and design rules for the polaron formation and its impact on electrical properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;Shaped CMOS Backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;brightness organic LED arrays are produced by direct vacuum deposition of the organic materials onto complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) backplanes produced in a commercial chip foundry. The composition of the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum anodes is analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and their surface is pre&#8208;conditioned for optimal electrical contact by plasma treatment.








Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g., as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and ultrastable passivation, e.g., to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. In this work, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs are deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy are performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers lead to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitate direct vacuum deposition of orange&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allow each pixel to switch individually. The OLED pixels generate a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2, corresponding to &gt;40&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on a Lateral 0D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved based on a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This leads to deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 21% at a high current density of &#8776;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in 3D perovskites. Here, a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure that can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness&#160;is demonstrated. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Theses LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

     alt="Efficient and Bright Deep-Red Light-Emitting Diodes based on a Lateral 0D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient and bright deep-red perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved based on a lateral Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/FA&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0D/3D) heterostructure, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This leads to deep-red perovskite LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 21% at a high current density of &#8776;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright and efficient deep-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep-red photons into human tissues. Metal-halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite-based deep-red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low-dimensional perovskites or trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in 3D perovskites. Here, a lateral Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/FA&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0D/3D) heterostructure that can enable efficient deep-red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness&#160;is demonstrated. The Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can facilitate the growth of low-defect FA&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and act as low-refractive-index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high-efficiency deep-red perovskite LEDs. Theses LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &amp;lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Concentration Limits the Hydrogen Evolution Rate in Organic Nanoparticle Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity shows that the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by aqueous&#8208;soluble organic donor&#8211;acceptor nanoparticles is limited by charge concentration, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition.








Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity is used to compare aqueous&#8208;soluble organic nanoparticle photocatalysts and bulk thin films composed of the same mixture of semiconducting polymer and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor molecule and the relationship between composition, interfacial surface area, charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and photocatalytic activity is examined. The rate of hydrogen evolution reaction by nanoparticles composed of various donor:acceptor blend ratio compositions is quantitatively measured, and it is found that the most active blend ratio displays a hydrogen quantum yield of 0.83% per photon. Moreover, it is found that nanoparticle photocatalytic activity corresponds directly to charge generation, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition. These results suggest that, under the current reaction conditions, with &#8776;3&#215; solar flux, catalytic activity by the nanoparticles is limited by the concentration of electrons and holes in operando and not a finite number of active surface sites or the catalytic rate at the interface. This provides a clear design goal for the next generation of efficient photocatalytic nanoparticles.

         <title>Organic Binary and Ternary Cocrystal Engineering Based on Halogen Bonding Aimed at Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between crystal packing motifs and optical properties of pure organic room temperature phosphorescent (ORTP) cocrystals with halogen bonding is investigated by comparing three different binary cocrystals. By designing ternary cocrystals based on the analysis, a highly efficient ORTP cocrystal with a PLQY of over 20% is achieved. To obtain insight into energy loss, the phosphorescent mechanism is discussed.








Abstract
Recently, there has been intense interest in pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) from cocrystals composed of 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (DITFB) and a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or their derivatives. To expand the possibility of halogen bonding&#8208;based cocrystals, the relationship between the crystal packing motifs and ORTP characteristics in binary cocrystals composed of DITFB and PAHs of phenanthrene (Phen), chrysene (Chry), and pyrene (Pyr), respectively, is investigated. The &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions determine not only the crystal packing motifs but also photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). The Phen&#8208;DITFB and Chry&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystals with&#160;&#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interactions show higher PLQY compared with the Pyr&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystal with &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interaction. Further, to clarify the effect of crystal structures on PLQY, ternary cocrystals are prepared by partially doping Pyr into Phen&#8208;DITFB. The crystal packing motif of the ternary cocrystal originates from a Phen&#8208;DITFB cocrystal with &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction, and some of the Phen sites are randomly replaced with Pyr molecules. The ORTP emission is derived from Pyr. The maximum PLQY is &gt;20% due to suppressing nonradiative decay by changing the crystal packing motif.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Platforms for Manipulating Light with Matter: Strong Light&#8211;Matter Coupling in Fully Solution&#8208;Processed Optical Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully solution&#8208;processed microcavities are demonstrated that allow realizing strong light&#8211;matter coupling with an organic semiconductor, all enabled by a versatile molecular hybrid material that permits the fabrication of dielectric mirrors with high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast between constituting layers.








Abstract
Planar microcavities with strong light&#8211;matter coupling, monolithically processed fully from solution, consisting of two polymer&#8208;based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) comprising alternating layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index titanium oxide hydrate/poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid material and a low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index fluorinated polymer are presented. The DBRs enclose a perylene diimide derivative (b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1) film positioned at the antinode of the optical mode. Strong light&#8211;matter coupling is achieved in these structures at the target excitation of the b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1. Indeed, the energy&#8208;dispersion relation (energy vs in&#8208;plane wavevector or output angle) in reflectance and the group delay of transmitted light in the microcavities show a clear anti&#8208;crossing&#8212;an energy gap between two distinct exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion branches. The agreement between classical electrodynamic simulations of the microcavity response and the experimental data demonstrates that the entire microcavity stack can be controllably produced as designed. Promisingly, the refractive index of the inorganic/organic hybrid layers used in the microcavity DBRs can be precisely manipulated between values of 1.50 to 2.10. Hence, microcavities with a wide spectral range of optical modes might be designed and produced with straightforward coating methodologies, enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the energy and lifetime of the microcavities&#8216; optical modes to harness strong light&#8211;matter coupling in a wide variety of solution processable active materials.

         <title>RAINBOW Organic Solar Cells: Implementing Spectral Splitting in Lateral Multi&#8208;Junction Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAINBOW solar cells consist of two or more junctions placed next to each other and illuminated by spectrally spread sunlight. Guidelines for materials selection are given for this novel geometry through device simulations. Moreover, experimental efficiencies greater than 46% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell are demonstrated for a monolithic two&#8208;junction device based on organic semiconducting absorbers.








Abstract
While multi&#8208;junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading bandgaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub&#8208;cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub&#8208;cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, with narrow, medium, and wide effective bandgaps, and their potential as sub&#8208;cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom&#8208;built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell. Finally, a working proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept monolithic device consisting of two sub&#8208;cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.

&lt;p&gt;RAINBOW solar cells consist of two or more junctions placed next to each other and illuminated by spectrally spread sunlight. Guidelines for materials selection are given for this novel geometry through device simulations. Moreover, experimental efficiencies greater than 46% with respect to the best sub-cell are demonstrated for a monolithic two-junction device based on organic semiconducting absorbers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While multi-junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading bandgaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub-cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub-cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, with narrow, medium, and wide effective bandgaps, and their potential as sub-cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom-built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub-cell. Finally, a working proof-of-concept monolithic device consisting of two sub-cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Templated 2D Polymer Heterojunctions for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polymer heterojunctions are formed using a novel templating technique and are investigated as photocatalysts for proton reduction. Templated materials showed improved charge separation and reduced trapped charges at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, which results in hydrogen evolution rates of 3&#8211;9 times that of either individual semiconductor and the ability to produce hydrogen in combination with the oxidation of reversible redox mediators, as well as sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their tunability, charge&#8208;transport properties, and robustness. They are&#160;however&#160;difficult to process and so there are limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work, a novel templating approach is used to combine an imine&#8208;based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between three and nine times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of &gt;20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt&#8208;based redox mediator. This suggests&#160;the improved charge&#8208;separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z&#8208;scheme formation.

         <title>Flexible Transparent Electrodes Formed from Template&#8208;Patterned Thin&#8208;Film Silver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
12&#8208;nm layers of silver deposited on the commercial optical adhesive NOA63 serve as ultrasmooth, haze&#8208;free transparent electrodes for optoelectronics that exhibit high resilience to bending. The electrodes may be readily patterned by selectively etching the NOA63 substrate with an oxygen plasma prior to metal deposition, with the silver forming continuous, conducting regions above unetched NOA63 and fragmented, highly insulating regions above etched NOA63.








Abstract
Template&#8208;patterned, flexible transparent electrodes (TEs) formed from an ultrathin silver film on top of a commercial optical adhesive &#8211; Norland Optical Adhesive 63 (NOA63) &#8211;&#160;are reported. NOA63 is shown to be an effective base&#8208;layer for ultrathin silver films that advantageously prevents coalescence of vapor&#8208;deposited silver atoms into large, isolated islands (Volmer&#8208;Weber growth), and so aids the formation of ultrasmooth continuous films. 12 nm silver films on top of free&#8208;standing NOA63 combine high, haze&#8208;free visible&#8208;light transparency (T &#8776; 60% at 550&#160;nm) with low sheet&#8208;resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$ &#8776; 16 &#937; sq&#8722;1), and exhibit excellent resilience to bending, making them attractive candidates for flexible TEs. Etching the NOA63 base&#8208;layer with an oxygen plasma before silver deposition causes the silver to laterally segregate into isolated pillars, resulting in a much higher sheet resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_{s}$&#160;&gt; 8 &#215; 106 &#937; sq-1) than silver grown on pristine NOA63 . Hence, by selectively etching NOA63 before metal deposition, insulating regions may be defined within an otherwise conducting silver film, resulting in a differentially conductive film that can serve as a patterned TE for flexible devices. Transmittance may be increased (to 79% at 550&#160;nm) by depositing an antireflective layer of Al2O3 on the Ag layer at the cost of reduced flexibility.

         <title>Understanding Causalities in Organic Photovoltaics Device Degradation in a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Throughput Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven high&#8208;throughput workflow for solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells is presented, identifying causal relationships between process conditions and active layer morphology, and between morphology and stability. Using only inexpensive and fast optical probes, quantitative structure&#8211;property relationships are obtained that improve the understanding and control of electrical performance degradation.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) now approach power conversion efficiencies of 20%. However, in order to enter mass markets, problems in upscaling and operational lifetime have to be solved, both concerning the connection between processing conditions and active layer morphology. Morphological studies supporting the development of structure&#8211;process&#8211;property relations are time&#8208;consuming, complex, and expensive to undergo and for which statistics, needed to assess significance, are difficult to be collected. This work demonstrates that causal relationships between processing conditions, morphology, and stability can be obtained in a high&#8208;throughput method by combining low&#8208;cost automated experiments with data&#8208;driven analysis methods. An automatic spectral modeling feeds parametrized absorption data into a feature selection technique that is combined with Gaussian process regression to quantify deterministic relationships linking morphological features and processing conditions with device functionality. The effect of the active layer thickness and the morphological order is further modeled by drift&#8211;diffusion simulations and returns valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms for improving device stability by tuning the microstructure morphology with versatile approaches. Predicting microstructural features as a function of processing parameters is decisive know&#8208;how for the large&#8208;scale production of OSCs.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Semiconducting Graft Copolymers to Achieve &#8220;Clickable&#8221; Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Long Circulation and Specific Cancer Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are a promising tool for theranostic applications. Here, a method of imparting colloidal stability, low&#8208;protein fouling, and high circulation efficiencies onto SPNs is described via a one&#8208;step, postpolymerization reaction. This method can also afford azide&#8208;functionalized SPNs, which allows for subsequent &#8220;click&#8221; reactions to achieve specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#160;(HER2) targeting in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low&#8208;fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole), in a simple one&#8208;step substitution reaction, postpolymerization. Further, by utilizing azide&#8208;functionalized PEG, anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#160;antibodies, antibody fragments, or affibodies are site&#8208;specifically &#8220;clicked&#8221; onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalized SPNs to specifically target HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Outstanding Fill Factor in Inverted Organic Solar Cells with SnO2 by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin oxide as electron transport layer in organic solar cells (OSCs) can promote high device performance and stability. However, the poor quality of the material and of the interface with the organic layer often limits its potential. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;quality tin oxide can be grown by atomic layer deposition, for the fabrication of OSCs with outstanding performance.








Abstract
Transport layers are of outmost importance for thin&#8208;film solar cells, determining not only their efficiency but also their stability. To bring one of these thin&#8208;film technologies toward mass production, many factors besides efficiency and stability become important, including the ease of deposition in a scalable manner and the cost of the different material's layers. Herein, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), in the inverted structure (n&#8208;i&#8208;p), are demonstrated by using as electron transport layer (ETL) tin oxide (SnO2) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is an industrial grade technique which can be applied at the wafer level and also in a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.26% and a record fill factor (FF) of 79% are shown by PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs when using ALD&#8208;SnO2 as ETL. These devices outperform solar cells with SnO2 nanoparticles casted from solution (PCE 16.03%, FF 74%) and also those utilizing the more common sol&#8211;gel ZnO (PCE 16.84%, FF 77%). The outstanding results are attributed to a reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface between the ALD&#8208;SnO2 film and the active layer. Furthermore, a higher stability under illumination is demonstrated for the devices with ALD&#8208;SnO2 in comparison with those utilizing ZnO.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Lasers: Cavity Formation and Emission Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review overviews approaches to find an optimal perovskite cavity patterning method, including indirect patterning, bottom&#8208;up patterning, top&#8208;down patterning, and top&#8208;down controlled bottom&#8208;up patterning. Fundamental mechanisms behind various emission behaviors in perovskite thin films and cavities are also compared and contrasted.








Abstract
Hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown remarkable optoelectronic properties as well as facile and cost&#8208;effective processability. With the success of MHP solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes, MHPs have also exhibited great potential as gain media for on&#8208;chip lasers. However, to date, stable operation of optically pumped MHP lasers and electrically driven MHP lasers&#8212;an essential requirement for MHP laser's insertion into chip&#8208;scale photonic integrated circuits&#8212;is not yet demonstrated. The main obstacles include the instability of MHPs in the atmosphere, rudimentary MHP laser cavity patterning methods, and insufficient understanding of emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of different strategies to improve the intrinsic properties of MHPs in the atmosphere and to establish an optimal MHP cavity patterning method. In addition, this review discusses different emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities and how to distinguish them.

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges of Colloidal Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To guide the pathway toward the commercialization of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication methods are reviewed to specify the current status and development direction. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when realizing active matrix QLED displays are provided.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit tremendous potential in display technologies owing to their unique optical properties, such as size&#8208;tunable emission wavelength, narrow spectral linewidth, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Significant efforts in academia and industry have achieved dramatic improvements in the performance of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) over the past decade, primarily owing to the development of high&#8208;quality QDs and optimized device architectures. Moreover, sophisticated patterning processes have also been developed for QDs, which is an essential technique for their commercialization. As a result of these achievements, some QD&#8208;based display technologies, such as QD enhancement films and QD&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, have been successfully commercialized, confirming the superiority of QDs in display technologies. However, despite these developments, the commercialization of QLEDs is yet to reach a threshold, requiring a leap forward in addressing challenges and related problems. Thus, representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication method to specify the current status and development direction are reviewed. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when conducting research on single&#8208;device QLEDs are provided to realize active matrix displays. This review guides the way toward the commercialization of QLEDs.

Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided. It starts with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors, and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, the applications of flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces are detailed. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field are summarized.

Abstract
Over the past three years, remarkable advancements in organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged, propelled by the introduction of Y6&#8212;an innovative A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA). This review provides a critical discussion of the current knowledge about the structural and physical properties of the PM6:Y6 material combination in relation to its photovoltaic performance. The design principles of PM6 and Y6 are discussed, covering charge transfer, transport, and recombination mechanisms. Then, the authors delve into blend morphology and degradation mechanisms before considering commercialization. The current state of the art is presented, while also discussing unresolved contentious issues, such as the blend energetics, the pathways of free charge generation, and the role of triplet states in recombination. As such, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PM6:Y6 material combination and its potential for further development in the field of organic solar cells. By addressing both the successes and challenges associated with this system, this review contributes to the ongoing research efforts toward achieving more efficient and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>Lest We Forget&#8211;The Importance of Heteroatom Interactions in Heterocyclic Conjugated Systems, from Synthetic Metals to Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular heteroatom interactions are well&#8208;known phenomena in organic charge transfer salts and are responsible for bulk metallic conductivity and even superconductivity. In this review, it is seen that the same interactions can be applied in organic semiconductors to increase bulk dimensionality through intermolecular contacts, and control molecular conformation through intramolecular interactions.








Abstract
The field of synthetic metals is, and remains, highly influential for the development of organic semiconductor materials. Yet, with the passing of time and the rapid development of conjugated materials in recent years, the link between synthetic metals and organic semiconductors is at risk of being forgotten. This review reflects&#160;on one of the key concepts developed in synthetic metals &#8211; heteroatom interactions. The application of this strategy in recent organic semiconductor materials, small molecules and polymers, is highlighted, with analysis of X&#8208;ray crystal structures and comparisons with model systems used to determine the influence of these non&#8208;covalent short contacts. The case is made that the wide range of effective heteroatom interactions and the high performance that has been achieved in devices from organic solar cells to transistors is testament to the seeds sown by the synthetic metals research community.

         <title>Broadband Photodetectors and Imagers in Stretchable Electronics Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of optical devices capable of detecting a wide range of wavelengths with stretchable packaging enables internal evaluations for health conditions and abnormalities of targeted living bodies and various objects without experiencing mechanical stress from an arbitrary surface. This review introduces the trends and detailed techniques of materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems.








Abstract
The integration of flexible electronics with optics can help realize a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of a smart society wherein internal evaluations can be easily performed nondestructively from the surface of various objects that is used or encountered in daily lives. Here, organic&#8208;material&#8208;based stretchable optical sensors and imagers that possess both bending capability and rubber&#8208;like elasticity are reviewed. The latest trends in nondestructive evaluation equipment that enable simple on&#8208;site evaluations of health conditions and abnormalities are discussed without subjecting the targeted living bodies and various objects to mechanical stress. Real&#8208;time performance under real&#8208;life conditions is becoming increasingly important for creating smart societies interwoven with optical technologies. In particular, the terahertz (THz)&#8208;wave region offers a substance&#8208; and state&#8208;specific fingerprint spectrum that enables instantaneous analyses. However, to make THz sensors accessible, the following issues must be addressed: broadband and high&#8208;sensitivity at room temperature, stretchability to follow the surface movements of targets, and digital transformation compatibility. The materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems used to overcome these issues are discussed in detail. Ultimately, stretchable optical sensors and imagers with highly sensitive and broadband THz sensors can facilitate the multifaceted on&#8208;site evaluation of solids, liquids, and gases.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multi&#8208;State Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step towards the realization of novel logic and memory devices. Here, we&#160;report on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we&#160;are able to control the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules within the lattice, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a particularly strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. Based on a single TAT molecule as a fundamental building block, we&#160;then explore the low&#8208;bias switching behavior in units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules purposefully defined by the high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. we&#160;demonstrate the possibility to realize up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled switching units, respectively. The switching dynamics can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as the observed full reversibility, makes this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory&#160;systems.

         <title>Entanglement Added to Cross&#8208;linked Chains Enables Tough Gelatin&#8208;based Hydrogel for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, it is still challenging to develop a hydrogel electrolyte matrix that can successfully achieve a harmonious combination of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and interfacial adaptability. Herein, we construct a multi&#8208;networked hydrogel electrolyte with a high entanglement effect based on the gelatin/oxidized dextran/methacrylic anhydride, denoted as ODGelMA. Attribute to the Schiff base network formulation of &#8722;RC = N&#8722;, oxidized dextran integrated gelatin chains induce a dense hydrophilic conformation group. Furthermore, addition of methacrylic anhydride into this system through a grafting process, the entangled hydrogel achieves impressive mechanical features (6.8&#160;MPa tensile strength) and high ionic conductivity (3.68 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C). The ODGelMA electrolyte can not only regulate the zinc electrode by circumventing dendrite growth but also showcase an adaptable framework reservoir to accelerate the Zn2+ desolvation process on the Zn surface. Benefiting from the entanglement effect, the Zn anode achieves an outstanding average CE of 99.8% over 500 cycles and cycling stability of 900&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell yields an ultra&#8208;long cycling stability of 10000 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.4% at 5&#160;C. Furthermore, a 60 mAh single&#8208;layer pouch cell maintains a stable work of 350 cycles.

         <title>Venus Flytrap&#8208;Inspired Data&#8208;Center&#8208;Free Fast Responsive Soft Robots Enabled by 2D Ni3(HITP)2 MOF and Graphite</title>

Abstract
The rapid and responsive capabilities of soft robots in perceiving, assessing, and reacting to environmental stimuli are highly valuable. However, many existing soft robots, designed to mimic humans and other higher animals, often rely on data centers for the modulation of mechanoelectrical transduction and electromechanical actuation. This reliance significantly increases system complexity and time delays. Herein, drawing inspiration from Venus flytraps, we present a soft robot employing a power modulation strategy for active stimulus reaction, eliminating the need for a data center. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(HITP)2 MOF with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and electromechanical actuation via graphite. The Joule&#8208;heating effect in graphite is effectively modulated by Ni3(HITP)2 before and after the presence of pressure, thus enabling the stimulus reaction of soft robots. As demonstrated, three soft robots are created: low&#8208;level edge Tongue robots, Venus flytrap robots, and high&#8208;level nerve&#8208;center&#8208;controlled dragonfly robots. This power modulation strategy inspires designs of edge soft robots and high&#8208;level robots with a human&#8208;like effective fusion of conditioned and unconditioned reflexes.

         <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Effect in 2D Ferroelectric for Electrically Tunable Metalens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advent of 2D ferroelectrics, characterized by their spontaneous polarization states in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer domains without the limitation of a finite size effect, brings enormous promise for applications in integrated optoelectronic devices. Comparing with semiconductor/insulator devices, ferroelectric devices show natural advantages such as non&#8208;volatility, low energy consumption and high response speed. Several 2D ferrelectric materials have been reported, however, the device implementation particularly for optoelectronic application remains largely hypothetical. Here, we&#160;discover the linear electro&#8208;optic effect in 2D ferroelectrics and demonstrate electrically tunable 2D ferroelectric metalens. We&#160;verified the linear electric&#8208;field modulation of light in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6. The in&#8208;plane phase retardation can be continuously tuned by a transverse DC electric field, yielding an effective electro&#8208;optic coefficient rc of 20.28 pm/V. The CuInP2S6 crystal exhibits birefringence with the fast axis oriented along its (010) plane. The 2D ferroelectric Fresnel metalens shows efficacious focusing ability with an electrical modulation efficiency of the focusing exceeding 34%. The theoretical analysis uncover the origin of the birefringence and unveil its ultralow light absorption across a wide wavelength range in this non&#8208;excitonic system. The van der Waals ferroelectrics enable room&#8208;temperature electrical modulation of light and offer the freedom of heterogenous integration with silicon and other material system for highly compact and tunable photonics and&#160;metaoptics.

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate Plays a Double&#8208;Edged Role on the Stability of Si Anode&#8208;based Rechargeable Batteries during Cycling and Calendar Aging</title>

Abstract
The energy storage density of Li&#8208;ion batteries could be improved by replacing graphite anodes with high&#8208;capacity Si&#8208;based materials, though instabilities have limited their implementation. Performance degradation mechanisms that occur in Si&#8208;anodes can be divided into cycling stability (capacity retention after repeated battery cycles) and calendar aging (shelf life). While the cycling stability and improvement strategies have been researched intensively, there is little known about the underlying mechanisms that cause calendar aging. In this work multiple electron microscope techniques were used to explore the mechanism that governs the calendar aging from sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;electrode scale. Plasma focused ion beam tomography were used to create 3D reconstructions of calendar aged electrodes and revealed the growth of a LiF&#8208;rich layer at the interface between the copper current collector and silicon material, which can lead to delamination and increased interfacial impendence. The LiF layer appeared to derive from the fluoro&#8208;ethylene&#8208;carbonate electrolyte additive, which is commonly used to improve cycling stability in Si&#8208;based systems. The results reveal that additives necessary to improve cycling stability can cause performance degradation over the long&#8208;term during calendar aging. The results show that high performing, stable system require careful design to simultaneously mitigate both cycling and calendar aging instabilities.

Abstract
The discovery of superconducting states in diverse topological materials generated a burgeoning interest to explore a topological superconductor and to realize a fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation. A variety of routes to realize topological superconductors have been proposed and many types of topological materials have been developed. However, a pristine topological material with a natural superconducting state is relatively rare as compared to topological materials with artificially induced superconductivity. Here, we report that the planar honeycomb structured three&#8208;dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi, which is the Zintl phase, shows a natural surface superconductivity at 2.1 K under ambient pressure. It is clearly identified from theoretical calculations that a topologically non&#8208;trivial state exists on the (100) surface. Further, its superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases by applying pressure, exhibiting a maximal Tc of 4.8 K under 6.2&#160;GPa. We believe that this discovery opens up a new possibility of exploring exotic Majorana fermions at the surface of 3D TDS superconductors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;mode Hydrogels with Structural and Fluorescent Colors Towards Multistage Secure Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Constructing an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with non&#8208;interference dual optical modes is an effective way to improve information security. However, it remains challenging to achieve multistage secure information encryption due to the limited stimulus responsiveness and color tunability of the current dual&#8208;mode materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors towards multistage information encryption is reported. In this hydrogel system, the rigid lamellar structure of poly(dodecylglyceryl itaconate) (pDGI) formed by shear flow&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly provides the restricted domains wherein monomers undergo polymerization to form a hydrogel network, producing structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer 6&#8208;acrylamidopicolinate (6APA) as a complexation site provides the possibility of fluorescent color formation. The hydrogel's angle&#8208;dependent structural color can be controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density and water content. Additionally, the fluorescence color can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of lanthanide ions. Information of dual&#8208;mode can be displayed separately in different channels and synergistically overlayed to read the ultimate message. Thus, a multistage information encryption system based on this hydrogel is devised through the programmed decryption process. This strategy holds tremendous potential as a platform for encrypting and safeguarding valuable and authentic information in the field of anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>The Defects Genome of Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from their unique two&#8208;faced structure, broken&#8208;mirror symmetry, and consequent colossal polarisation field within the monolayer. While efforts have been made to achieve high&#8208;quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain&#8208;boundary and point defects with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic properties Through High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point defects are single (VS&#8197;and VSe) and double chalcogen vacancy (VS &#8722;VSe), interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic studies on h&#8208;BN&#8208;encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality and device properties.

         <title>Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa Intermetallic Nanocatalysts with Enhanced Methanol Oxidation Performance for Efficient Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as the MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduces the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents the ClER. To this end, developing high&#8208;performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, we report a novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticles (i&#8208;NPs) catalyst, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mgPGM&#8722;1), a large specific activity (18.13&#160;mA cmPGM&#8722;2), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), online differential mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt2CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of the synergistic OH&#8722; groups near Pd sites. Using Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C i&#8208;NPs as anodic catalysts, we demonstrate MOR&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis that continuously operates under 1.23&#160;V for 240&#160;h in simulated seawater and 120&#160;h in natural seawater without notable degradation, showing great potential for energy&#8208;saving and cost&#8208;competitive hydrogen production from seawater.

         <title>Cultivating High&#8208;Performance Flexible All&#8208;in&#8208;One Supercapacitors with 3D Network Through Continuous Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible supercapacitors are potential to power next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), w e have cultivated a flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode&#8208;separator&#8208;electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm&#8722;2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15&#160;MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6&#160;kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway towards high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.

         <title>Promotion of Probabilistic Bit Generation in Mott Devices by Embedded Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two&#8208;terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p&#8208;bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p&#8208;bit generation. Herein, we demonstrate that the randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8208;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO2 Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt&#8208;NP&#8208;containing VO2 threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p&#8208;bit operation (e.g., up to &#8764;300% increase in &#916;Vprobe upon going from (Pt NP/VO2)0 to (Pt NP/VO2)11) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit/s), low power consumption (14 nJ/bit), and high stability (&gt;105,200 bits) for p&#8208;bit generation. Thus, our study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

         <title>CVD Synthesis of Twisted Bilayer WS2 with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted bilayer transitionmetal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform for investigating intriguing fundamental physical properties. A tilted SiO2/Si substrate is introduced into chemical vapordeposition to synthesize twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. The strong correlation between the SHG response and the twist angle suggests atunable SHG performance with twist angles.








Abstract
The introduction of rotational freedom by twist angles in twisted bilayer (TB) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can tailor the inherent properties of the TMDCs, which provides a promising platform to investigate the exotic physical properties. However, direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality TB&#8208;TMDCs with full twist angles is significantly challenging due to the substantial energy barriers during crystal growth. Here, a modified chemical vapor deposition strategy is proposed to synthesize TB&#8208;WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. Utilizing a tilted SiO2/Si substrate, a gas flow disturbance is generated in the furnace tube to create a heterogeneous concentration gradient of the metal precursor, which provides an extra driving force for the growth of TB&#8208;WS2. The Raman and photoluminescence results confirm a weak interlayer coupling of the TB&#8208;WS2. High&#8208;quality periodic Moir&#233; patterns are observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Moreover, owing to the strong correlation between the nonlinear optical response and the twisted crystal structure, tunable second harmonic generation behaviors are realized in the TB&#8208;WS2. This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality and pristine TB&#8208;TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.

         <title>Probing Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanostructures Using STEM&#8208;EELS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbolic shear polaritons are observed in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The propagation and reflection of polariton modes are studied. The tunable broad spectral polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 expand the scope of &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 from its application in traditional electronic devices to applications in nanophotonics and metamaterials.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, quasiparticles arising from strong coupling between electromagnetic waves and optical phonons, have potential for applications in subdiffraction imaging, sensing, thermal conduction enhancement, and spectroscopy signal enhancement. A new class of phonon polaritons in low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic crystals, hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs), have been verified recently in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 by free electron laser (FEL) measurements. However, detailed behaviors of HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures still remain unknown. Here, by using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy, the experimental observation of multiple HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 in the mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and far&#8208;infrared (FIR) ranges is reported. HShPs in various &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanorods and a &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanodisk are excited. The frequency&#8208;dependent rotation and shear effect of HShPs reflect on the distribution of EELS signals. The propagation and reflection of HShPs in nanostructures are clarified by simulations of electric field distribution. These findings suggest that, with its tunable broad spectral HShPs, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 is an excellent candidate for nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Enhanced Chemoradiotherapy for MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis Using Immunomodulatory Polymer&#8208;Reinforced Nanotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanoradiosensitizer with improved light penetration depth for enhanced chemoradiotherapy effect to reverse immunosuppression in the biofilm&#8208;caused poorly innate immunity area and to eliminate MRSA&#8208;infected deep&#8208;tissue infections. The polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics in the rat osteomyelitis model verify that chemoradiotherapy expresses an excellent modality for deep&#8208;tissue infection management and a promising immunomodulatory treatment to enhance the therapeutic effects of bacterial infections.








Abstract
The eradication of osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge due to its development of biofilm&#8208;induced antibiotic resistance and impaired innate immunity, which often leads to frequent surgical failure. Here, the design, synthesis, and performance of X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics that modulate the immunological properties of infectious microenvironments to enhance chemoradiotherapy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial deep&#8208;tissue infections are reported. Upon X&#8208;ray radiation, the proposed polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutic generates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. To robustly eradicate MRSA biofilms at deep infection sites, these species can specifically bind to MRSA and penetrate biofilms for enhanced chemoradiotherapy treatment. X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated nanotherapeutics modulate the innate immunity of macrophages to prevent the recurrence of osteomyelitis. The remarkable anti&#8208;infection effects of these nanotherapeutics are validated using a rat osteomyelitis model. This study demonstrates the significant potential of a synergistic chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy method for treating MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected osteomyelitis.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is proven to exist in violet phosphorus nanosheets by photoluminescence, and the modulation rates enter a good agreement with the theoretical values. The underlying mechanism is clarified by first&#8208;principle calculations that the strain&#8208;induced asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions plays a crucial role in the nonmonotonic modulation. 








Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well&#8208;predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under varying strain. Here, a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus (VP) nanosheets is observed, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which is reported in a few other 2D materials in knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 and &#8722;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials toward optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

Black phosphorus&#8208;methylene blue (BP&#8208;MB) is continuously released from intranasal BP&#8208;MB@Gel and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating the neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.









Abstract
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, the treatment of AD remains challenging owning to the hindrance caused by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the complex pathology of AD. Nasal delivery represents an effective means of circumventing the BBB and delivering drugs to the brain. In this study, black phosphorus (BP) is used as a drug carrier, as well as an antioxidant, and loaded with a tau aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), to obtain BP&#8208;MB. For intranasal (IN) delivery, a thermosensitive hydrogel is fabricated by cross&#8208;linking carboxymethyl chitosan and aldehyde Pluronic F127 (F127&#8208;CHO) micelles. The BP&#8208;MB nanocomposite is incorporated into the hydrogel to obtain BP&#8208;MB@Gel. BP&#8208;MB@Gel could be injected intranasally, providing high nasal mucosal retention and controlled drug release. After IN administration, BP&#8208;MB is continuously released and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of AD. These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.

         <title>Dibromomethane Knitted Highly Porous Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Efficient High&#8208;Pressure Methane Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high porous SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br, synthesized via a slow&#8208;knitting method using DBM as both solvent and cross&#8208;linker under low dosage of an AlCl3 catalyst, exhibits the highest surface area among the reported HCPs and an impressive performance in high&#8208;pressure methane storage and delivery, which provides a feasible and efficient approach for the scalable production of high&#8208;porosity HCPs with a dynamic&#8208;level control.








Abstract
Hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with ultra&#8208;high porosity, superior physicochemical stability, and excellent cost&#8208;effectiveness are attractive candidates for methane storage. However, the construction of HCPs with BET surface areas exceeding 3000 m2 g&#8722;1 remains extremely challenging. In this work, a newly developed DBM&#8208;knitting method with a slow&#8208;knitting rate is employed to increase the cross&#8208;linking degree, in which dichloromethane (DCM) is replaced by dibromomethane (DBM) as both solvent and electrophilic cross&#8208;linker, resulting in highly porous and physicochemically stable HCPs. The BET surface areas of DBM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Br are 44%&#8211;120% higher than that of DCM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Cl using the same building blocks. Remarkably, SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br exhibits an unprecedentedly high porosity (SBET = 3120&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) among reported HCPs, and shows a competitive volumetric 5&#8211;100&#160;bar working methane capacity of 191 cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 273&#160;K calculated by using real packing density, which outperforms sate&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;organic framework (MOFs) at comparable conditions. This facile and versatile low&#8208;knitting&#8208;rate strategy enables effective improvement in the porosity of HCPs for porosity&#8208;desired applications.

         <title>Triphenylamine Spirofunctionalized Light&#8208;Emitting Conjugated Polymer with an Ultradeep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Emission for Large&#8208;Area Printed Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coated ultradeep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are fabricated based on triphenylamine spirofunctionalized polydiarylfluorenes (POPSAF). POPSAF present a&#160;stable narrowband emissionand good charge transport behavior. Large&#8208;area printed PLEDs are constructed with an uniform emission of full width at half maximum &#8776;36&#160;nm and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage of (0.155, 0.072) for preliminary passive matrix PLED display.








Abstract
Emerging printed large&#8208;area polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are essential for manufacturing flat&#8208;panel displays and solid lighting devices. However, it is challenging to obtain large&#8208;area and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue PLEDs because of the lack of light&#8208;emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) with robust deep&#8208;blue emissions, excellent morphological stabilities, and high charging abilities. Here, a novel unsymmetrically substituted polydiarylfluorene (POPSAF) is obtained with stable narrowband emission for large&#8208;area printed displays via triphenylamine (TPA) spirofunctionalization of LCPs. POPSAF films show narrowband and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 36&#160;nm, associated with their intrachain excitonic behavior without obvious polaron formation. Compared to controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPF), excellent charge transport is observed in the POPSAF films because of the intrinsic hole transport ability of the TPA units. Large&#8208;area PLEDs are fabricated via blade&#8208;coating with an emission area of 9 cm2, which exhibit uniform ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with an FWHM of 36&#160;nm and corresponding Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.155, 0.072). These findings are attributed to the synergistic effects of robust emission, stable morphology, and printing capacity. Finally, preliminary printed passive matrix (PM) PLED displays with 20 &#215; 20 pixels monochromes are fabricated, confirmed the effectiveness of spirofunctionalization in optoelectronics.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Driven Proton Sponge Nano&#8208;Assembly for Imaging and Triggering Lysosome&#8208;Regulated Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton sponge nano&#8208;assembly (PSNA) is optimized with self&#8208;assembly dependent fluorescence, positive charge density, and cell cytotoxicity. PSNA triggers immunogenic cell death (e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) of tumor cells, followed by the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens, danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of dendritic cells by these molecules.








Abstract
Triggering lysosome&#8208;regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212;a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano&#8208;assemblies (PSNAs) with self&#8208;assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity are created. Such PSNAs are constructed via low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched PEI covalently bound to self&#8208;assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;PyTPE leads to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self&#8208;assembly tendency of PSNAs is further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies reveal that the lysosome rupturing&#8208;regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA&#8208;triggered ICD activate immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.

         <title>Dislodgement of Hydrogen Bubbles in Microchannels with Embedded Pillars: An Analytical, Experimental, and Numerical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the fundamental behavior, forces, and interactions between entrapped gas bubbles and microchannels are provided. These microchannels include porous structures at the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Here, analytical, experimental, and numerical investigations are employed to present balanced and unbalanced conditions for gas bubble interfaces. This enables, in specific cases, bubble dislodgment at low pressure loads while enhancing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.








Abstract
Microchannels with integrated pillars have enhanced the production capabilities and performance of various applications due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. However, emerging gas bubbles can become trapped, potentially limiting the functionality or efficiency of the device when scaled down to the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Understanding the conditions required to dislodge these bubbles is thus critical for optimizing microfluidic devices with complex physical behaviors. Here an analytical model is presented that outlines the dislodgment conditions and driving forces for such gas&#8211;liquid flows. These terms are derived from the gas&#8211;liquid interface properties, geometry, and processing parameters. As the density of the pillar arrangement is scaled down, the resistance to bubble dislodgment typically increases. Nevertheless, the bubble is compelled to dislodge at lower pressure loads when critical volumes are reached. This newly discovered effect is particularly noticeable in densely packed arrays and can be explained by the interplay of increased surface tension, geometrical restrictions, and volume&#8208;preserving forces. The analytical terms and effects are validated through novel experimental and numerical methods tailored for microchannels in the low&#8208;micrometer scale, showing strong agreement.

         <title>2D Lateral Heterojunction Arrays with Tailored Interface Band Bending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a new strategy, using semiconducting monolayers of Si2Te2 and Sb2Te3, for the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunction arrays with tunable interfacial band alignment. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the continuous lattice of the two&#8208;dimensional&#160;Si2Te2/Sb2Te3 lateral heterojunctions and directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well&#8208;defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si2Te2 grown on Sb2Te3 (ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3) and one&#8208;quintuple&#8208;layer Sb2Te3 grown on monolayer Si2Te2 (1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2) on a p&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 substrate. The site&#8208;specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick&#8208;Sb2Te3, ML&#8208;Si2Te2, and 1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3 films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's p&#8208;doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface. This reported strategy opens avenues for advancing lateral epitaxy technology, facilitating practical applications of 2D in&#8208;plane heterojunctions.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly known as radioenhancers, HfO2 nanoparticles reported in the study present surprising radioprotection in mice and rabbits, along with selective organ&#8208;targeting through fine&#8208;tuned synthesis. These multienzyme&#8208;mimicking agents can be visualized by spectral computed tomography with improved half&#8208;life and stability over amifostine. The protective mechanisms involve inhibiting DNA damage and inflammation and attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades.








Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, radiosensitivity indices are evaluated of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) are rationally designed via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation&#8208;induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. A universal methodology is proposed to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.

         <title>Enhancing CAR Macrophage Efferocytosis Via Surface Engineered Lipid Nanoparticles Targeting LXR Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a novel approach to address efferocytosis disruption in atherosclerosis. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages are engineered to target and engulf resistant apoptotic cells, with reactive oxygen species responsive nanoparticles enhancing their efficacy. This innovative cell therapy platform shows promise in promoting lipid efflux and reducing inflammation, offering the potential for advanced cardiovascular disease treatments.








Abstract
The removal of dying cells, or efferocytosis, is an indispensable part of resolving inflammation. However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis&#8208;resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR&#8208;Ms can transmigrate within a mico&#8208;fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment. The developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next&#8208;generation cardiovascular disease therapies and further studies include in vivo experiments.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

Perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. Their electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction is enhanced through the exsolution Ni nanoparticles enhanced by electrochemical poling and coupled with Mn codoping. Mn dopants enable more flexible coordination, facilitating oxygen ion migration resulting in more Ni nanoparticles and improved adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules.








Abstract
In this study, perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10) are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. The catalytic activity of these cathodes toward CO2 reduction reaction is significantly enhanced through the exsolution of highly active Ni nanoparticles, driven by applying a current of 1.2 A in 97% CO2 &#8211; 3% H2O. The performance of La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05Ti0.95O3&#8722;&#947; is notably improved by co&#8208;doping with Mn. Mn dopants enhance the reducibility of Ni, a crucial factor in promoting the in situ exsolution of metallic nanocatalysts in perovskite (ABO3) structures. This improvement is attributed to Mn dopants enabling more flexible coordination, resulting in higher oxygen vacancy concentration, and facilitating oxygen ion migration. Consequently, a higher density of Ni nanoparticles is formed. These oxygen vacancies also improve the adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules. The dual doping strategy provides enhanced performance without degradation observed after 133&#160;h of high&#8208;temperature operation, suggesting a reliable cathode material for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Polymorphic Self&#8208;Assembly with Procedural Flexibility for Monodisperse Quaternary Protein Structures of DegQ Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As smart building blocks, proteins can create quaternary structures in polymorphic configurations determined by soft clients. In the present study, highly monodisperse, one&#8208;way clustering is programmed by the protomer, DegQ, featuring procedural flexibility in the self&#8208;assembly procedure. First high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of DegQ are presented, validating the feasibility and flexibility of programming proteins with native robot&#8208;like functions.








Abstract
As large molecular tertiary structures, some proteins can act as small robots that find, bind, and chaperone target protein clients, showing the potential to serve as smart building blocks in self&#8208;assembly fields. Instead of using such intrinsic functions, most self&#8208;assembly methodologies for proteins aim for de novo&#8208;designed structures with accurate geometric assemblies, which can limit procedural flexibility. Here, a strategy enabling polymorphic clustering of quaternary proteins, exhibiting simplicity and flexibility of self&#8208;assembling paths for proteins in forming monodisperse quaternary cage particles is presented. It is proposed that the enzyme protomer DegQ, previously solved at low resolution, may potentially be usable as a threefold symmetric building block, which can form polyhedral cages incorporated by the chaperone action of DegQ in the presence of protein clients. To obtain highly monodisperse cage particles, soft, and hence, less resistive client proteins, which can program the inherent chaperone activity of DegQ to efficient formations of polymorphic cages, depending on the size of clients are utilized. By reconstructing the atomic resolution cryogenic electron microscopy DegQ structures using obtained 12&#8208; and 24&#8208;meric clusters, the polymorphic clustering of DegQ enzymes is validated in terms of soft and rigid domains, which will provide effective routes for protein self&#8208;assemblies with procedural flexibility.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene, which exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, and thus has important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.








Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer&#160;hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (BH&#8208;UPE), which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interlinking, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface&#8208;modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly interlinked with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;UPE interchain entanglement and bonding. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and hydrophilic initiator to p.p.m. levels.&#160;Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface&#8208;modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous&#160;surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, BH&#8208;UPE exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, demonstrating great potential as an advanced bearing material for disc prosthesis. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired Design of S&#8208;Synergized Fe&#8211;Fe Dual&#8208;Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, iron&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal center catalysts are strategically designed and fabricated by mimicking ferredoxin, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the single Fe sites as the &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for precise modulation of the electronic structure. Thereby, balancing the adsorption/desorption behavior of the reaction intermediates, and accelerating the overall reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in&#8208;depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, Fe&#8208;based DMCs (Fe2N6&#8208;S) are strategically designed and fabricated, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse&#8208; and fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as&#8208;prepared Fe2N6&#8208;S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zinc&#8208;air (Zn&#8211;air) battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O2 adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#9472;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d&#8208;band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate&#8208;determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Bioresorbable Multilayer Organic&#8211;Inorganic Films for Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer design strategy for bioresorbable encapsulating structures that serve as water barriers for electronic systems. This approach not only protects implantable electronic devices from biofluids to ensure reliable operational performance but also enables favorable degradation after a desired period of use. This materials system&#160;may find broad and immediate applications for a range of practical electronic devices that are capable of resorption in biological and environmental settings.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronic devices as temporary biomedical implants represent an emerging class of technology relevant to a range of patient conditions currently addressed with technologies that require surgical explantation after a desired period of use. Obtaining reliable performance and favorable degradation behavior demands materials that can serve as biofluid barriers in encapsulating structures that avoid premature degradation of active electronic components. Here, this work presents a materials design that addresses this need, with properties in water impermeability, mechanical flexibility, and processability that are superior to alternatives. The approach uses multilayer assemblies of alternating films of polyanhydride and silicon oxynitride formed by spin&#8208;coating and plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies investigate the effects of material composition and multilayer structure on water barrier performance, water distribution, and degradation behavior. Demonstrations with inductor&#8208;capacitor circuits, wireless power transfer systems, and wireless optoelectronic devices illustrate the performance of this materials system as a bioresorbable encapsulating structure.

         <title>150 Gbps THz Chipscale Topological Photonic Diplexer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip photonic diplexer for sixth to X generation communication works on the principle of power splitting and terahertz spectrum filtering. The topological nature of the silicon chip facilitates simultaneous multiplexing and demultiplexing of the two broadband 12.5 GHz channels (CH1 and CH2) to support an aggregated data speed of 150 Gbps.








Abstract
Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on&#8208;chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into nonoverlapping multicarrier frequency sub&#8208;bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency&#8208;selective time&#8208;invariant channels. Here, an on&#8208;chip topological diplexer is reported exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunneling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high&#8208;speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit&#160;s&#8722;1. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Assisted Generation and Straight Movement of Skyrmion Bubble in Kagome TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise generation and straight movement of skyrmion bubble are demonstrated at zero field and room temperature in the Kagome plane of TbMn6Sn6 by conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating, where the crucial contribution of local anisotropy variation near the spin reorientation transition and geometric confinement is validated in simulation, highlighting a significant possibility for the compatible application in skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic textures are promising candidates as binary data units for the next&#8208;generation memory device. The precise generation and convenient control of nontrivial spin topology at zero field near room temperature endows the critical advantages in skyrmionic devices but is not simultaneously integrated into one material. Here, in the Kagome plane of quantum TbMn6Sn6, the expedient generation of the skyrmion bubbles in versatile forms of lattice, chain, and isolated one by converging the electron beam, where the electron intensity gradient contributes to the dynamic generation from local anisotropy variation near spin reorientation transition (SRT) is reported. Encouragingly, by utilizing the dynamic shift of the SRT domain interface, the straight movement is actualized with the skyrmion bubble slave to the SRT domain interface forming an elastic composite object, avoiding the usual deflection from the skyrmion Hall effect. The critical contribution of the SRT domain interface via conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating is further theoretically validated in micromagnetic simulation, highlighting the compatible application possibility in advanced devices.

         <title>Resonant Band Hybridization in Alloyed Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. Here, this approach is applied to van der Waals heterostructures built from semiconducting monolayers of MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy and WSe2 (or MoSe2). Interlayer exciton photoluminescence monitors the bandstructure modifications as a function of alloy composition x. Strong bandstructure hybridization is unveiled leading to a transition from direct to indirect bandgap for x&lt;0.6 in MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2 heterostructures.








Abstract
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. While alloying has been studied in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, its application in van der Waals heterostructures built from atomically thin layers is largely unexplored. Here, heterobilayers made from monolayers of WSe2 (or MoSe2) and MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy are fabricated and nontrivial tuning of the resultant bandstructure is observed as a function of concentration x. This evolution is monitored by measuring the energy of photoluminescence (PL) of the interlayer exciton (IX) composed of an electron and hole residing in different monolayers. In MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2, a strong IX energy shift of &#8776;100 meV is observed for x varied from 1 to 0.6. However, for x &lt; 0.6 this shift saturates and the IX PL energy asymptotically approaches that of the indirect bandgap in bilayer WSe2. This observation is theoretically interpreted as the strong variation of the conduction band K valley for x &gt; 0.6, with IX PL arising from the K &#8722; K transition, while for x &lt; 0.6, the bandstructure hybridization becomes prevalent leading to the dominating momentum&#8208;indirect K &#8722; Q transition. This bandstructure hybridization is accompanied with strong modification of IX PL dynamics and nonlinear exciton properties. This work provides foundation for bandstructure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures highlighting the importance of hybridization effects and opening a way to devices with accurately tailored electronic&#160;properties.

         <title>Controlled Refolding of Denatured IL&#8208;12 Using In Situ Antigen&#8208;Capturing Nanochaperone Remarkably Reduces the Systemic Toxicity and Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A self&#8208;assembled nanochaperone (P&#8208;nChap) is designed as in situ antigen capturing nanovaccine to enhance cytokine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. P&#8208;nChap effectively avoids on&#8208;target, off&#8208;tumor toxicity of IL&#8208;12 by delivering its denatured form, which can be only refolded into native states in response to tumor microenvironment. Moreover, P&#8208;nChap releases PTX to produce ICD, captures TAAs and transports to DCs to facilitate antigen cross&#8208;presentation.








Abstract
Cytokines are powerful in cancer immunotherapy, however, their therapeutic potential is limited by the severe systemic toxicity. Here a potent strategy to reduce the toxicity of systemic cytokine therapy by delivering its denatured form using a finely designed nanochaperone, is described. It is demonstrated that even if the denatured protein cargos are occasionally released under normal physiological conditions they are still misfolded, while can effectively refold into native states and release to function in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the systemic toxicity of cytokines is nearly completely overcome. Moreover, an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic is further loaded and delivered to tumor using this nanochaperone to trigger the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) that are subsequently captured in situ by nanochaperone and then reflows into lymph nodes (LNs) to promote antigen cross&#8208;presentation. This optimized personalized nanochaperone&#8208;vaccine demonstrates unprecedented suppressive effects against large, advanced tumors, and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy results in a significant abscopal effect and inhibition of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hence, this approach provides a simple and universal delivery strategy to reduce the systemic toxicities of cytokines, as well as provides a robust personalized cancer vaccination platform, which may find wide applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Defect&#8208;Driven Synergistic Synaptic Heterostructures for Gate&#8208;Free Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative gate&#8208;free Fe7S8@MoS2 heterostructure wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell is developed to realize the effective photocarrier trapping through the exploitation of intrinsic defects in the Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system.








Abstract
The optoelectronic synaptic devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer great advances for future neuromorphic visual systems with dramatically improved integration density and power efficiency. The effective charge capture and retention are considered as one vital prerequisite to realizing the synaptic memory function. However, the current 2D synaptic devices are predominantly relied on materials with artificially&#8208;engineered defects or intricate gate&#8208;controlled architectures to realize the charge trapping process. These approaches, unfortunately, suffer from the degradation of pristine materials, rapid device failure, and unnecessary complication of device structures. To address these challenges, an innovative gate&#8208;free heterostructure paradigm is introduced herein. The heterostructure presents a distinctive dome&#8208;like morphology wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell (Fe7S8@MoS2), allowing the realization of effective photocarrier trapping through the intrinsic defects in the adjacent Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors with memory time up to &#8776;800 s under single optical pulse, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system with significantly improved image recognition efficiency. The emergence of such heterostructures foreshadows a promising trajectory for underpinning future synaptic devices, catalyzing the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and intricate visual processing applications.

         <title>A Gas Therapy Strategy for Intestinal Flora Regulation and Colitis Treatment by Nanogel&#8208;Based Multistage NO Delivery Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to regulate the intestinal microbiota for the colitis treatment by targeting inflamed tissues to release NO. This microcapsule exhibits good resistance to digestive fluids and the nanogel has good inflammation targeting and NO release properties. In vivo experiments show that the gas therapy strategy modulates intestinal microbiota, reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal repair.








Abstract
Current approaches to treating inflammatory bowel disease focus on the suppression of overactive immune responses, the removal of reactive intestinal oxygen species, and regulation of the intestinal flora. However, owing to the complex structure of the gastrointestinal tract and the influence of mucus, current small&#8208;molecule and biologic&#8208;based drugs for treating colitis cannot effectively act at the site of colon inflammation, and as a result, they tend to exhibit low efficacies and toxic side effects. In this study, nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to achieve NO release at the inflammation site by targeting the inflammatory tissues using the nanogel. Surprisingly, oral administration of the microcapsules suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria and increases the abundance of probiotic bacteria. Metabolomics further show that an increased abundance of intestinal probiotics promotes the production of metabolites, including short&#8208;chain fatty acids and indole derivatives, which modulate the intestinal immunity and restore the intestinal barrier via the interleukin&#8208;17 and PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways. This work reveals that the developed gas therapy strategy based on multistage NO delivery microcapsules modulates the intestinal microbial balance, thereby reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal barrier repair, ultimately providing a new therapeutic approach for the clinical management of colitis.

         <title>In Situ Mitochondrial Biomineralization for Drug&#8208;Free Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mitochondrial biomineralization approach is developed, where the mitochondrial targeted nanosystem is activated via near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation as a burst source of PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ for drug&#8208;free cancer therapy.








Abstract
The common clinical chemotherapy often brings serious side effects to patients, mainly due to the off&#8208;target and leakage of toxic drugs. However, this is fatal for some specific clinical tumors, such as brain tumors and neuroma. This study performs a drug&#8208;free approach by encapsulating black phosphorus (BP) and calcium peroxide (CaO2) in liposomes with surface&#8208;modified triphenylphosphonium (BCLT) to develop mitochondria targeting calcification for cancer therapy without damaging normal cells. BCLT preferentially accumulates inside tumor mitochondria and then is activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to produce abundant PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ to accelerate in situ mitochondrial mineralization, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell death. More importantly, both PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ are essential components of metabolism in the body, and random gradient diffusion or premature leakage does not cause damage to adjacent normal cells. This achievement promises to be an alternative to conventional chemotherapy in clinical practice for many specific tumor types.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Responsive Cell Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanoparticles against Liver Fibrosis via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

&lt;p&gt;The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.

         <title>Gold Recovery from E&#8208;Waste by Food&#8208;Waste Amyloid Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative approach to recover gold from e&#8208;waste using protein amyloid aerogels derived from food waste. These aerogels demonstrate exceptional gold adsorption capabilities, transforming gold ions into gold single crystals at the microscopic level and yielding a high&#8208;purity 22&#8208;carat gold nugget in bulk, demonstrating an eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective potential for gold recovery.








Abstract
Demand for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste grows steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource&#8208;intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side&#8208;stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste. To do so, AF aerogels are prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in waste electrical and electronic equipment (e&#8208;waste). The results demonstrate that AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1) and selectivity, making it efficient and an adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from e&#8208;waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high&#8208;purity gold nuggets, constituted by &#8776;90.8&#160;wt% gold (21&#8211;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8211;economic analysis of the process finally consolidate the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side&#8208;streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>22% Record Efficiency in Nanorod Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Achieved by Gradient Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency nanorod light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (NR&#8208;LEDs) are fabricated using CdSe/CdZnSe/CdZnS/ZnS core/shell nanorods. The gradient alloyed CdZnSe/CdZnS shell effectively suppresses the electron delocalization and reduces hole injection barrier compared with conventional CdS shell. Therefore, the NRs exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and a high degree of linear polarization. The NR&#8208;LEDs show record external quantum efficiency, high brightness, and high current efficiency simultaneously.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on isotropic quantum dots has approached the theoretical limit of close to 20%. Anisotropic nanorods can break this limit by taking advantage of their directional emission. However, the progress towards higher EQE by using CdSe/CdS nanorods (NRs) faces several challenges, primarily involving the low quantum yield and unbalanced charge injection in devices. Herein, the seeded growth method is modified and anisotropic nanorods are obtained with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 98% by coating a gradient alloyed CdZnSe shell around conventional spherical CdSe seeds. This intermediate alloyed CdZnSe shell combined with a subsequent rod&#8208;shaped CdZnS/ZnS shell can effectively suppress the electron delocalization in the typical CdSe/CdS nanorods due to their small conduction bandgap offset. Additionally, this alloyed shell can reduce the hole&#8208;injection barrier and create a larger barrier for electron injection, both effects promoting a balanced injection of electrons and holes in LEDs. Hence, LEDs are reached with high brightness (160341&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and high efficiency (EQE = 22%, current efficiency = 23.19&#160;cd A&#8722;1), which are the highest values to date for nanorod LEDs.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Loaded Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Bacteria for Immuno&#8208;Chemo Combo Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During intravesical treatment, Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) facilitates the tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) nanoparticles. Subsequently, the released DOX induces both chemotherapeutic and immunogenic tumor cell death, thereby releasing additional damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns. This synergistic interaction between DOX and BCG contributes to the establishment of antitumor immunity, ultimately achieving a comprehensive intravesical therapy of bladder cancer.








Abstract
Intravesical Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) is a well&#8208;established strategy for managing high&#8208;risk nonmuscle&#8208;invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, over half of patients still experience disease recurrence or progression. Although the combined intravesical instillation of various chemotherapeutic drugs is implemented in clinical trials to enhance the BCG therapy, the outcome is far from satisfying due to severe irritative effects and treatment intolerance at high doses. Therefore, it is adopted the &#8220;biotin&#8211;streptavidin strategy&#8221; to doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles within live BCG bacteria (DOX@BCG) to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence of BCG to the bladder epithelium helps precisely target DOX@BCG to the local tumor cells and simultaneously increases intratumoral transport of therapeutic drugs. DOX@BCG effectively inhibits cancer progression and prolongs the survival of rats/mice with orthotopic bladder cancer owing to synergism between BCG&#8208;immunotherapy, DOX&#8208;chemotherapy, and DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic tumor cell death; furthermore, it exhibits improved tolerance and biosafety, and establishes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the drug&#8208;loaded live BCG bacterial delivery system holds considerable potential for clinical translation in the intravesical treatment of bladder cancer.

         <title>Sensitive Organic Photodetectors With Spectral Response up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m Using a Quinoidal Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quinoidal molecular semiconductor, with a photoelectric response of up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m, is developed. The resulting photodetector affords unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26% and 41% at a wavelength of 1.10&#160;&#181;m under zero bias and a reverse bias, respectively. Moreover, owing to the low trap density, the photodetector demonstrates detectivity exceeding 1012 Jones from 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Detecting short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light has underpinned several emerging technologies. However, the development of highly sensitive organic photodetectors (OPDs) operating in the SWIR region is hindered by their poor external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and high dark currents. Herein, the development of high&#8208;sensitivity SWIR&#8208;OPDs with an efficient photoelectric response extending up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m is reported. These OPDs utilize a new ultralow&#8208;bandgap molecular semiconductor featuring a quinoidal tricyclic electron&#8208;deficient central unit and multiple non&#8208;covalent conformation locks. The SWIR&#8208;OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal&#8208;generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (Dsh*) exceeding 1013 Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 1012 Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR&#8208;OPD.

The SWIR-OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal-generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR-OPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Microchannel Scaffolds with Instructive Niches Reinforce Endogenous Bone Regeneration by Regulating CSF&#8208;1/CSF&#8208;1R Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a hybrid microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is engineered by a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation by regulating the colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1)/colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) pathway of macrophages.








Abstract
Structural and physiological cues provide guidance for the directional migration and spatial organization of endogenous cells. Here, a microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is developed using a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. Thereinto, polydopamine&#8208;coated nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite is employed as a functional inorganic linker to participate in the entanglement and crystallization of chitosan molecules. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis as well as its in vitro and in vivo verification demonstrates that essential colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1) factor is induced by this scaffold, and effectively bound to the target colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) on the macrophage surface to activate the M2 phenotype, achieving substantial endogenous bone regeneration. This strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for engineering inducible bone regenerative biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering Dual CO2&#8208; and Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Membranes for Switchable Double Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coated fiber consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings is prepared by two&#8208;step coating. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics, achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various double oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. 








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes demonstrate promising applications in switchable oil/water emulsion separations. However, they are unsuitable for the treatment of double emulsions like oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (O/W/O) and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) emulsions. For efficient separation of these complicated emulsions, fine control over the wettability, response time, and aperture structure of the membrane is required. Herein, dual&#8208;coated fibers consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings are prepared by two steps. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics and narrow pore size distributions. These membranes exhibit fast switching wettability between superhydrophilicity (under CO2 stimulation) and high hydrophobicity (under near&#8208;infrared stimulation), achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. Two&#8208;dimensional low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance and correlated spectra technique are used to clarify the underlying mechanism of switchable double emulsion separation. The approach can effectively address the challenges associated with the use of stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes for double emulsion separation and facilitate the industrial application of these membranes.

         <title>Triboelectric Energy Harvesting from Highly Conjugated Fused Aromatic Ladder Structure Under Extreme Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure is developed as a tribo&#8208;positive material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The 3D&#8208;FAL offers high specific surface area and porosity, good physicochemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. As a result, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG demonstrates high performance and stability under harsh operating conditions.








Abstract
Practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been challenging, particularly, under harsh environmental conditions. This work proposes a novel 3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure as a tribo&#8208;positive material for TENGs, to address these challenges. The 3D&#8208;FAL offers a unique materials engineering platform for tailored properties, such as high specific surface area and porosity, good thermal and mechanical stability, and tunable electronic properties. The fabricated 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG reaches a maximum peak power density of 451.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 5 Hz frequency. More importantly, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG maintains stable output performance under harsh operating environments, over wide temperature (&#8722;45&#8211;100&#160;&#176;C) and humidity ranges (8.3&#8211;96.7% RH), representing the development of novel FAL for sustainable energy generation under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG proves to be a promising device for a speed monitoring system engaging reconstruction in virtual reality in a snowy environment.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ionic Hopping Migration and Self&#8208;Healability toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is presented to introduce oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based (OR&#8208;PUU/PAM) hydrogel electrolytes. Benefiting from their high ionic conductivity, desolvation effect, ionic hopping migration, and self&#8208;healability, the resulting Zn symmetric cell exhibits prominent cycling stability. This work provides meaningful guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs), characterized by intrinsic safety, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility, can promote the development of flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). However, current FAZIB technology is severely restricted by the uncontrollable dendrite growth arising from undesirable reactions between the HEs with sluggish ionic conductivity and Zn metal. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a molecular engineering strategy, which involves the introduction of oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based HEs. The OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs facilitate rapid ion transfer through their ionic hopping migration mechanism, resulting in uniform and orderly Zn2+ deposition. The abundant polar groups on the OR&#8208;PUU molecules in OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs break the inherent H&#8208;bond network, tune the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. Moreover, the interaction of hierarchical H&#8208;bonds in the OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs endows them with self&#8208;healability, enabling in situ repair of cracks induced by plating/stripping. Consequently, Zn symmetric cells incorporating the novel OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs exhibit a long cycling life of 2000&#160;h. The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.

The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite-free Zn-metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Sprayed Bioinspired Adhesive Conductive Hydrogels for Cavernous Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a bioinspired nucleobase adhesion strategy is proposed to design an adhesive conductive hydrogel spray with immunomodulatory, and endoscopic delivery convenience for cavernous nerve repair. The feasibility and validity of sprayable hydrogel in minimally invasive surgery is verified through the use of a beagle model. The results reveal the great potential of sprayable conductive hydrogel materials as next&#8208;generation minimally invasive nerve repair materials.








Abstract
Cavernous nerve injury (CNI), resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED), poses a significant threat to the quality of life for men. Strategies utilizing conductive hydrogels have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerves with a large diameter (&gt;2&#160;mm). However, integrating convenient minimally invasive operation, antiswelling and immunomodulatory conductive hydrogels for treating small&#8208;diameter injured cavernous nerves remains a great challenge. Here, a sprayable adhesive conductive hydrogel (GACM) composed of gelatin, adenine, carbon nanotubes, and mesaconate designed for cavernous nerve repair is developed. Multiple hydrogen bonds provide GACM with excellent adhesive and antiswelling properties, enabling it to establish a conformal electrical bridge with the damaged nerve and aiding in the regeneration process. Additionally, mesaconate&#8208;loaded GACM suppresses the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages and promotes the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells. In vivo tests demonstrate that the GACM hydrogel repairs the cavernous nerve and restores erectile function and fertility. Furthermore, the feasibility of sprayable GACM in minimally invasive robotic surgery in beagles is validated. Given the benefits of therapeutic effectiveness and clinical convenience, the research suggests a promising future for sprayable GACM materials as advanced solutions for minimally invasive nerve repair.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional pore structures of polyolefin separators have a significant influence on the ion flux distribution towards the lithium (Li) electrode, which consequently causes different Li deposition behavior. It is revealed that an appropriate separator creates a more homogeneous Li ion flux, a more compact deposit Li, and enables Li metal batteries to achieve a longer cycle life.








Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional&#160;pores of different polyethylene separators, it is revealed that the pore structure of the separator has a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior, and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It is also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li&#8208;ion toward Li metal electrode is positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of the pore structure of polyolefin separators but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Coexistence of Quantum&#8208;Spin&#8208;Hall and Quantum&#8208;Hall&#8208;Topological&#8208;Insulating States in Graphene/hBN on SrTiO3 Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a monolayer hBN spacer allows the coexistence of quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) states with different symmetries and causes for the helical edge spin phases in the same single graphene placed on an SrTiO3 substrate, with a crossover regime between the two at low magnetic fields.








Abstract
SrTiO3 (STO) substrate, a perovskite oxide material known for its high dielectric constant (&#603;), facilitates the observation of various (high&#8208;temperature) quantum phenomena. A quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) state, comprising two copies of QH states with antiparallel two ferromagnetic edge&#8208;spin overlap protected by the U(1) axial rotation symmetry of spin polarization, has recently been achieved in low magnetic field (B) even as high as &#8776;100 K in a monolayer graphene/thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacer placed on an STO substrate, thanks to the high &#603; of STO. Despite the use of the heavy STO substrate, however, proximity&#8208;induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) states in 2D TI phases, featuring a topologically protected helical edge spin phase within time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry, is not confirmed. Here, with the use of a monolayer hBN spacer, it is revealed the coexistence of QSH (at B = 0T) and QHTI (at B &#8800; 0) states in the same single graphene sample placed on an STO, with a crossover regime between the two at low B. It is also classified that the different symmetries of the two nontrivial helical edge spin phases in the two states lead to different interaction with electron&#8208;puddle quantum dots, caused by a local surface pocket of the STO, in the crossover regime, resulting in a spin dephasing only for the QHTI state. The results obtained using STO substrates open the doors to investigations of novel QH spin states with different symmetries and their correlations with quantum phenomena. This exploration holds value for potential applications in spintronic devices.

         <title>Underpotential Deposition of 3D Transition Metals: Versatile Electrosynthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Oxidized Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple, versatile approach for synthesis of oxidized carbon&#8208;supported mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single atom catalysts (SACs) based on underpotential deposition. The authors achieve minute&#8208;scale synthesis of Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs under ambient conditions and showcase the catalytic performance of an as&#8208;synthesized Co SAC for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has become a popular strategy for tuning activity and selectivity toward specific pathways. However, conventional SAC synthesis methods require high temperatures and pressures, complicated procedures, and expensive equipment. Recently, underpotential deposition (UPD) has been investigated as a promising alternative, yielding high&#8208;loading SAC electrodes under ambient conditions and within minutes. Yet only few studies have employed UPD to synthesize SACs, and all have been limited to UPD of Cu. In this work, a flexible UPD approach for synthesis of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs directly on oxidized, commercially available carbon electrodes is reported. The UPD mechanism is investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and, finally, the catalytic performance of a UPD&#8208;synthesized Co SAC is assessed for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. The findings expand upon the usefulness and versatility of UPD for SAC synthesis, with hopes of enabling future research toward realization of fast, reliable, and fully electrified SAC synthesis processes.

This study shows that self&#8208;assembled zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8211;MXene nanocomposites, featuring tunable built&#8208;in electric field, exhibit outstanding microwave absorption performance (reflection loss (RLmin) = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (fE) = 6.32 GHz). This innovative model system provides insights into interfacial polarization mechanisms and introduces a pioneering approach to developing electromagnetic functional materials through spatial charge heterointerface engineering.








Abstract
Heterointerface engineering, which plays a pivotal role in developing advanced microwave&#8208;absorbing materials, is employed to design zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8211;MXene nanocomposites. The ZIF&#8211;MXene composites are prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of negatively charged titanium carbide MXene flakes and positively charged Co&#8208;containing ZIF nanomaterials. This approach effectively creates abundant Mott&#8211;Schottky heterointerfaces exhibiting a robust built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) effect, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical analyses, leading to a notable attenuation of electromagnetic energy. Systematic manipulation of the BIEF&#8208;exhibiting heterointerface, achieved through topological modulation of the ZIF, proficiently alters charge separation, facilitates electron migration, and ultimately enhances polarization relaxation loss, resulting in exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss RLmin = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth fE = 6.32 GHz). The present study demonstrates an innovative model system for elucidating the interfacial polarization mechanisms and pioneers a novel approach to developing functional materials with electromagnetic characteristics through spatial charge engineering.

         <title>Observation of High&#8208;Capacity Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 with Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry as T&#8208;Nb2O5 and similar structure to B&#8208;TiO2 is essentially inert for lithium storage. To address this issue, here implementation of both electron transport and Li+ migration &#8220;superhighways&#8221; by developing defect&#8208;rich and nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x pseudocrystals via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion is proposed. The resulting B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x achieves ultrahigh specific capacity and rate capability, surpassing that of Li4Ti5O12.








Abstract
Apart from Li4Ti5O12, there are few anode substitutes that can be used in commercial high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Orthorhombic T&#8208;Nb2O5 has recently been proven to be another substitute anode. However, monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry is essentially inert for lithium storage, but the underlying reasons are unclear. In order to activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5, herein, nanoporous pseudocrystals to achieve a larger specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8722;1 than Li4Ti5O12 (theoretical capacity: 175 mAh g&#8722;1) are proposed. These pseudocrystals are rationally synthesized via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion process from LiNbO3 precursor. Compared to pristine B&#8208;Nb2O5, experimental investigations reveal that B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers &#8776;3000 times higher electronic conductivity and tenfold enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient. An &#8776;30% reduction of energy barrier for Li&#8208;ion migration is also confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers unique ion/electron transport channels to proliferate the reversible and deeper lithiation, which activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5. The capacitive&#8208;like behavior is observed to endow B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x ultrafast lithium storage ability, harvesting 136 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C and 72 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 250 C, superior to Li4Ti5O12. Pouch&#8208;type full cells exhibit the energy density of &#8776;251&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and ultrahigh power density up to &#8776;35&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.

         <title>PbS Quantum Dots Ink with Months&#8208;Long Shelf&#8208;Lifetime Enabling Scalable and Efficient Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead iodide is used in phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of&#160;PbS quantum dots of size up to 6.7 nm. These inks show at least ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, confirmed by the absorption spectroscopy and the field&#8208;effect transistor performances. Photodetectors fabricate via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity.








Abstract
The phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of PbS quantum dots (QDs) has substantially simplified device fabrication giving hope for future industrial exploitation. However, this technique when applied to QDs of large size (&gt;4&#160;nm) gives rise to inks with poor colloidal stability, thus hindering the development of QDs photodetectors in short&#8208;wavelength infrared range. Here, it is demonstrated that methylammonium lead iodide ligands can provide sufficient passivation of PbS QDs of size up to 6.7&#160;nm, enabling inks with a minimum of ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, as proven by optical absorption and solution&#8208;small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Furthermore, the maximum linear electron mobility of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 is measured in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated with fresh inks, while transistors fabricated with the same solution after ten&#8208;week storage retain 74% of the average starting electron mobility, demonstrating the outstanding quality both of the fresh and aged inks. Finally, photodetectors fabricated via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity, values comparable with devices fabricated using ink with lower stability and wasteful methods such as spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Rapid 3D Printing of Photoresponsive Resins for Optically Clear Multifunctional 3D Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors have developed novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins for photoactive 3D printing. Their mechanistic evaluation of photoinitiating systems enable 3D printing of transparent objects with rapid build speeds and exceptional feature resolution. By incorporating hexaarylbiimidazole derivatives in the resin formulation, spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation is achieved, providing capabilities such as crack healing and selective erasing under violet/blue light irradiation.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven 3D printing is gaining significant attention for its unparalleled build speed and high&#8208;resolution in additive manufacturing. However, extending vat photopolymerization to multifunctional, photoresponsive materials poses challenges, such as light attenuation and interference between the photocatalysts (PCs) and photoactive moieties. This study introduces novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high&#8208;resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine&#8208;based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low&#8208;intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically&#8208;clear 3D printed objects. Real&#8208;time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI&#8208;containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&#8722;1, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self&#8208;healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.

This study introduces novel visible-light-driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high-resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine-based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low-intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially-resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically-clear 3D printed objects. Real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI-containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength-orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible-light-based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self-healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next-generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Hydrogel Films with Tunable Luminescence and Afterglow Behavior for Visual Detection of Ofloxacin and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lanthanide MOF &#8211; carrageenan hydrogel material is prepared and its luminescent sensing properties towards ofloxacin antibiotic in raw meat are demonstrated. Hydrogel films based on bimetallic MOFs demonstrate tunable multicolor luminescence with the afterglow effect suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Highly selective and sensitive quantitative detection of ofloxacin (OFX) at ultralow concentrations in aqueous media and development of new afterglow materials remains a challenge. Herein, a new 2D water&#8208;stable lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb) is proposed, which exhibits high selectivity towards OFX through the luminescence quenching with the lowest detection limit (1.1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;9 M) reported to date and a fast response within 6 s. In addition, the luminescent detection of OFX by NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is not affected by typical components of blood plasma and urine. The excellent sensing effect of NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is further utilized to prepare a composite functional sensing carrageenan hydrogel material for the rapid detection of OFX in meat in real time and the first discovery of impressive afterglow in MOF&#8208;based hydrogels. This study not only presents novel Ln&#8208;MOF materials and Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color&#8208;tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Targeted Macrophage CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 mRNA Editing in Immunotherapy for Tendon Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional delivery methods of CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. This work furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase, triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently to alleviate inflammation.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 holds substantial promise for tissue repair through its RNA editing capabilities and swift catabolism. However, conventional delivery methods fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. In this investigation, macrophage&#8208;targeting cationic polymers are systematically screened to facilitate the entry of Cas13 ribonucleic&#8208;protein complex (Cas13 RNP) into macrophages. Notably, SPP1 (OPN encoding)&#8208;producing macrophages are recognized as a profibrotic subtype that emerges during the inflammatory stage. By employing ROS&#8208;responsive release mechanisms tailored for macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP editing systems, the overactivation of SPP1 is curbed in the face of an acute immune microenvironment. Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtails the emergence of injury&#8208;induced SPP1&#8208;producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, this study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.

         <title>A Spiking Artificial Vision Architecture Based on Fully Emulating the Human Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiking&#8208;based artificial vision architecture consisting of event&#8208;based spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses is reported. The spiking photodetectors directly convert light into electrical spiking signals for artificial synapse&#8208;based neuromorphic computing. And the event&#8208;triggered mechanism greatly reduces the total power consumption. This fully emulated human vision architecture will effectively improve the performance of artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Intelligent vision necessitates the deployment of detectors that are always&#8208;on and low&#8208;power, mirroring the continuous and uninterrupted responsiveness characteristic of human vision. Nonetheless, contemporary artificial vision systems attain this goal by the continuous processing of massive image frames and executing intricate algorithms, thereby expending substantial computational power and energy. In contrast, biological data processing, based on event&#8208;triggered spiking, has higher efficiency and lower energy consumption. Here, this work proposes an artificial vision architecture consisting of spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses, closely mirroring the intricacies of the human visual system. Distinct from previously reported techniques, the photodetector is self&#8208;powered and event&#8208;triggered, outputting light&#8208;modulated spiking signals directly, thereby fulfilling the imperative for always&#8208;on with low&#8208;power consumption. With the spiking signals processing through the integrated synapse units, recognition of graphics, gestures, and human action has been implemented, illustrating the potent image processing capabilities inherent within this architecture. The results prove the 90% accuracy rate in human action recognition within a mere five epochs utilizing a rudimentary artificial neural network. This novel architecture, grounded in spiking photodetectors, offers a viable alternative to the extant models of always&#8208;on low&#8208;power artificial vision system.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Schottky Junction Treats Atherosclerosis by a Biomimetic Trojan Horse Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a rod&#8208;like gold&#8208;zinc oxide (Au&#8208;ZnO) Schottky junction for enhanced piezocatalytic performance and camouflage with the macrophage membrane for improved biocompatibility and intraplaque enrichment. The obtained biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM promotes foamy macrophage apoptosis as well as cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis activated by apoptotic fragments, fulfilling amplified piezocatalytic atherosclerosis therapy by a biomimetic Trojan horse strategy.








Abstract
The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque is characterized by the&#160;foamy macrophage burden, involving impaired cholesterol efflux and deficient efferocytosis. Correspondingly, piezocatalytic therapy is an emerging solution for eliminating the foamy macrophage burden with satisfactory spatiotemporal controllability and deep penetration depth. Herein, a biomimetic Trojan horse (Au&#8208;ZnO@MM) is engineered by coating the macrophage membrane (MM) onto the surface of a rod&#8208;like Au&#8208;ZnO Schottky Junction to effectively relieve the atherosclerotic progression. These Trojan horses with the coating of MM are actively transported into subsistent foamy macrophages and generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalysis. ROS&#8208;initiated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction induce substantial cell apoptosis, alleviating the burden of subsistent foamy macrophages. The resulting apoptotic fragments further significantly facilitate cholesterol excretion and trigger efferocytosis of intraplaque fresh macrophages. Ultimately, the biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM piezocatalyst not only inhibits the foaming capacity of macrophages, but also improves the function of removing cell debris, which can stabilize atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Meanwhile, the plasmon resonance effect of integrated gold nanoparticles enables favorable photoacoustic molecular imaging for real&#8208;time image&#8208;guided atherosclerotic therapy. This proposed biomimetic Trojan horse strategy provides the paradigm of employing ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalytic methodology for enhanced atherosclerotic theranostics.

         <title>4D Multimaterial Printing of Soft Actuators with Spatial and Temporal Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the double&#8208;layer printed circuit board structure, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator that integrates a hydrophilic pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel and a hydrophobic shape&#8208;memory polymer with an adhesive layer to overcome poor interface compatibility, is designed. This integration enables active spatiotemporal control of actuation, while 4D printing facilitates a diverse range of configurations. 








Abstract
Soft actuators (SAs) are devices which can interact with delicate objects in a manner not achievable with traditional robotics. While it is possible to design a SA whose actuation is triggered via an external stimulus, the use of a single stimulus creates challenges in the spatial and temporal control of the actuation. Herein, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator design (MMSA) whose actuation is only initiated by a combination of triggers (i.e., pH and temperature) is presented. Using 3D printing, a multilayered soft actuator with a hydrophilic pH&#8208;sensitive layer, and a hydrophobic magnetic and temperature&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer layer, is designed. The hydrogel responds to environmental pH conditions by swelling or shrinking, while the shape&#8208;memory polymer can resist the shape deformation of the hydrogel until triggered by temperature or light. The combination of these stimuli&#8208;responsive layers allows for a high level of spatiotemporal control of the actuation. The utility of the 4D MMSA is demonstrated via a series of cargo capture and release experiments, validating its ability to demonstrate active spatiotemporal control. The MMSA concept provides a promising research direction to develop multifunctional soft devices with potential applications in biomedical engineering and environmental engineering.

         <title>Isomerization of Benzothiadiazole Yields a Promising Polymer Donor and Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.0%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole to 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) in polymers can concurrently improve photon harvest, suppress nonradiative energy loss, and increase charge mobility. Consequently, the organic solar cells (OSCs) made with polymer PiBT donor and Y6 acceptor achieve efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Polymer PiBT does broaden the family of efficient polymer donors.








Abstract
The exploration of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors remains critical to achieve high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) beyond current thresholds. Herein, the 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT), which is an isomer of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT), is used to design wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor PiBT. The PiBT&#8208;based solar cells reach efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Systemic studies show that isomerization of BT to iBT can finely regulate the polymers&#8217; photoelectric properties including i) increasing the extinction coefficient and photon harvest, ii) downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels, iii) improving the coplanarity of polymer backbones, iv) offering good thermodynamic miscibility with acceptors. Consequently, the PiBT:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device simultaneously reaches advantageous nanoscale morphology, efficient exciton generation and dissociation, fast charge transportation, and suppressed charge recombination, leading to larger VOC of 0.87&#160;V, higher JSC of 28.2 mA cm&#8722;2, greater fill factor of 77.3%, and thus higher efficiency of 19.0%, while the analog&#8208;PBT&#8208;based OSCs reach efficiency of only 12.9%. Moreover, the key intermediate iBT can be easily afforded from industry chemicals via two&#8208;step procedure. Overall, this contribution highlights that iBT is a promising motif for designing high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Molecular Motor&#8208;Driven Light&#8208;Controlled Logic&#8208;Gated K+ Channel for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>

         <dc:description>
Deeply understanding the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins based on artificial ion transport systems remains challenging. In this study, a molecular motor&#8208;derived photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel resembling a multi&#8208;core processor is developed. The channel can step&#8208;wise control ion transport and anticancer treatments via executing logic gate instructions. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis.








Abstract
Developing artificial ion transport systems, which process complicated information and step&#8208;wise regulate properties, is essential for deeply comprehending the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins (NCPs). Here a photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel based on single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers containing molecular motors, exhibiting multi&#8208;core processor&#8208;like properties to step&#8208;wise control ion transport is reported. Designed with oxygen, deoxygenation, and different wavelengths of light as input signals, complicated logical circuits comprising &#8220;YES&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221; and &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate components are established. Implementing these logical circuits with K+ transport efficiencies as output signals, multiple state transitions including &#8220;ON&#8221;, &#8220;Partially OFF&#8221; and &#8220;Totally OFF&#8221; in liposomes and cancer cells are realized, further causing step&#8208;wise anticancer treatments. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state (decrease by 50% within 7&#160;min) significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis. This integrated logic&#8208;gated strategy will be expanded toward understanding the delicate mechanism underlying NCPs and treating cancer or other diseases is expected.

         <title>A Nanoscale Trans&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly with a Distinct Anticancer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly Pt&#8211;tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP)&#8211;benzoic acid (BA) is synthesized. In presence of H2O2, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA undergoes decomposition and generates bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species, which can induce unconventional interstrand cross&#8208;links and groove binding with DNA, respectively. These different mechanisms of action from cisplatin make Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA kill Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells efficiently.








Abstract
Drug resistance significantly hampers the clinical application of existing platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs. New platinum medications that possess distinct mechanisms of action are highly desired for the treatment of Pt&#8208;resistant cancers. Herein, a nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly (Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA) is prepared via using trans&#8208;[PtCl2(pyridine)(NH3)] (transpyroplatin), tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP), and benzoic acid (BA) as building blocks to combat drug resistance in platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies indicate that Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA shows a hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;responsive dissociation behavior along with the generation of bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species. Different from cisplatin, these degradation products interact with DNA via interstrand cross&#8208;links and small groove binding, and induce significant upregulation of cell&#8208;death&#8208;related proteins such as p53, cleaved caspase 3, p21, and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. As a result, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA exhibits potent killing effects against Pt&#8208;resistant tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work not only provides a new platinum drug for combating drug&#8208;resistant cancer but also offers a new paradigm for the development of platinum&#8208;based supramolecular anticancer drugs.

         <title>Regenerated Graphite Electrodes with Reconstructed Solid Electrolyte Interface and Enclosed Active Lithium Toward &gt;100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ and fast solid electrolyte interface (SEI) engineering strategy (&lt;1 s) is proposed to efficiently convert degraded graphite into an air&#8208;stable, prelithiated, and regenerated material via reconstructing the original SEI and utilizing the residual active lithium, featuring significant environmental and economic advantages. This innovative approach holds the potential to efficiently propel the development of high&#8208;performance anodes.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is arguably the most important concern in graphite anodes, which determines their achievable Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. In spent graphite anodes, there are already&#8208;formed (yet loose and/or broken) SEIs and some residual active lithium, which, if can be inherited in the regenerated electrodes, are highly desired to compensate for the lithium loss due to SEI formation. However, current graphite regenerated approaches easily destroy the thin SEIs and residue active lithium, making their reuse impossible. Herein, this work reports a fast&#8208;heating strategy (e.g., 1900 K for &#8776;150&#160;ms) to upcycle degraded graphite via instantly converting the loose original SEI layer (&#8776;100&#160;nm thick) to a compact and mostly inorganic one (&#8776;10&#8211;30&#160;nm thick with a 26X higher Young's Modulus) and still retaining the activity of residual lithium. Thanks to the robust SEI and enclosed active lithium, the regenerated graphite exhibited 104.7% initial CE for half&#8208;cell and gifted the full cells with LiFePO4 significantly improved initial CE (98.8%&#160;versus 83.2%) and energy density (309.4&#160;versus 281.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), as compared with commercial graphite. The as&#8208;proposed upcycling strategy turns the &#8220;waste&#8221; graphite into high&#8208;value prelithiated ones, along with significant economic and environmental benefits.

         <title>Intergrating Hollow Multishelled Structure and High Entropy Engineering toward Enhanced Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Properties in Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high entropy oxide (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 hollow multishelled sphere (HEO&#8208;HoMS) with multiple electroactive elements is successfully developed. Benefiting from the delicate cocontrol from molecule to microstructure, HEO&#8208;HoMS provides impressively high specific capacity and long life span for lithium storage. This work may inspire more thoughts on rational multiscale design of conversion&#8208;type electrodes.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) are attracting great interest in lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the conversion anodes, owing to their superior buffering effect and mechanical stability. Given the synthetic challenges, especially elemental diffusion barrier in the multimetal combinations, this complex structure design has been realized in low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy compounds so far. It means that poor reaction reversibility and low intrinsic conductivity remain largely unresolved. Here, a hollow multishelled (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 high entropy oxide (HEO) is developed through integrating molecule and microstructure engineering. As expected, the HoMS design exhibits significant targeting functionality, yielding satisfactory structure and cycling stability. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen defects and optimized electronic structure of HEO accelerate the lithiation kinetics, while the retention of the parent lattice matrix enables reversible lithium storage, which is validated by rigorous in situ tests and theoretical simulations. Benefiting from these combined properties, such hollow multishelled HEO anode can deliver a specific capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 (89% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The synergistic lattice and volume stability showcased in this work holds great promise in guiding the material innovations for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Epigenetically Relieving the MYC&#8208;Correlated Immunosuppression via an Advanced Nano&#8208;Radiosensitizer Potentiates Cancer Immuno&#8208;Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy causes patients severe MYC&#8208;mediated immune tolerance. To address this clinical issue, a high&#8208;Z metal&#8211;phenolic nanoradiosensitizer is engineered to dual&#8208;epigenetically downregulate MYC expression and trigger cancer cellular IFN&#8208;I signaling. This tactic significantly enhances the proliferation, intratumoral infiltration, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells but decreases the levels of immune suppressors.








Abstract
Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy&#8208;triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC&#8208;transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, 5&#8208;Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF&#8208;2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) are engineered into a tungsten&#8208;based nano&#8208;radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5&#8208;Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF&#8208;2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) signaling. Coupling 5&#8208;Aza with ITF&#8208;2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC&#8208;related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN&#8208;I signal&#8208;related proteins involving IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI&#8208;triggered immuno&#8208;radiotherapy remarkably enhances antitumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory&#8208;phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy&#8208;induced MYC overexpression via the dual&#8208;epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno&#8208;radiotherapy.

         <title>A Hybrid Pulsed Laser Deposition Approach to Grow Thin Films of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials is challenging due to differences in the reactivity, and surface adatom sticking and mobility. A novel approach &#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor delivery is combined with pulsed laser deposition is used to grow several sulfides as epitaxial or textured thin films with superior crystallinity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. 








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity, sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, a novel approach is reported to grow chalcogenides&#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides, transition metal chalcogenides, and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated, and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity, and surface and interface roughness compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The growth method can be broadened to other vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched chalcogenides such as selenides and tellurides. This work opens up opportunities for broader epitaxial growth of chalcogenides, especially sulfide&#8208;based thin film technological applications.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Encryption Fueled via Tunable Mechanical Composite Micrograting Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dynamic optical encryption strategy using tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By generating dynamic keys with large space capacity for encrypted diffraction patterns, MCWGES effectively prevents eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in information security.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Optical grating devices based on micro/nanostructured functional surfaces are widely employed to precisely manipulate light propagation, which is significant for information technologies, optical data storage, and light sensors. However, the parameters of rigid periodic structures are difficult to tune after manufacturing, which seriously limits their capacity for in situ light manipulation. Here, a novel anti-eavesdropping, anti-damage, and anti-tamper dynamic optical encryption strategy are reported via tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By mechanically composing multiple in-situ tunable ordered wrinkle gratings, the dynamic keys with large space capacity are generated to obtain encrypted diffraction patterns, which can provide a higher level of security for the encrypted systems. Furthermore, a multiple grating cone diffraction model is proposed to reveal the dynamic optical encryption principle of MCWGES.

         <title>Stretchable Device for Simultaneous Measurements of Contractility and Electrophysiology of Neuromuscular Tissue in the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable electrode made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is demonstrated for simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses in dynamic neuromuscular gastrointestinal tissues. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional lithography.








Abstract
Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone FS&#8208;30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean&#8208;room&#8208;based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#181;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.

         <title>Graphene and MOF Assembly: Enhanced Fabrication and Functional Derivative via MOF Amorphization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of graphene&#8208;MOFs (MOFs, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) carries substantial implications across diverse domains. This work provides an efficient fabrication of graphene&#8208;MOFs assembly, uncovers critical mechanisms underlying the assembly efficiency, and showcases the assembly's versatility in electrocatalysis through MOF amorphization. By doing so, it is aimed to open up new avenues for graphene&#8208;MOFs in advancing the field of electrocatalysis and beyond.








Abstract
The integration of graphene and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has numerous implications across various domains, but fabricating such assemblies is often complicated and time&#8208;consuming. Herein, a one&#8208;step preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF assembly is presented by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF&#8208;7, ZIF&#8208;8, and ZIF&#8208;67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high&#8208;efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. The versatility of VG&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67 assembly is further demonstrated&#160;by exploring the process of MOF amorphization. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin&#8208;film coating formed on VG (named VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67), which preserves the short&#8208;range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF&#8208;67 while sacrificing the long&#8208;range order. Such a unique film&#8208;on&#8208;graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF&#8208;67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well&#8208;suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H2O2 in acid media.

         <title>Carboxylating Elastomer via Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Reaction to Improve Miscibility with Conjugated Polymers for Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to enhance the miscibility between the conjugated polymer PM6 and the insulating elastomer styrene&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene (SBS) has been developed by incorporating carboxyl groups into SBS (SBS&#8208;COOH), resulting in optimized mechanical properties and morphology of PM6. A remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is achieved for organic solar cells with 5% SBS&#8208;COOH (PM6:L8&#8208;BO system), outperforming devices of PM6:L8&#8208;BO without or with SBS.








Abstract
Incorporating flexible insulating polymers is a straightforward strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of rigid conjugated polymers, enabling their use in flexible electronic devices. However, maintaining electronic characteristics simultaneously is challenging due to the poor miscibility between insulating polymers and conjugated polymers. This study introduces the carboxylation of insulating polymers as an effective strategy to enhance miscibility with conjugated polymers via surface energy modulation and hydrogen bonding. The carboxylated elastomer, synthesized via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, closely matches the surface energy of the conjugated polymer. This significantly improves the mechanical properties, achieving a high crack&#8208;onset strain of 21.48%, surpassing that (5.93%) of the unmodified elastomer:conjugated polymer blend. Upon incorporating the carboxylated elastomer into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based organic solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is attained, which top&#8208;performs among insulating polymer&#8208;incorporated devices and outperforms devices with unmodified elastomer or neat PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The superior efficiency is attributed to the optimized microstructures and enhanced crystallinity for efficient and balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, flexible devices with 5% carboxylated elastomer exhibit superior mechanical stability, retaining &#8776;88.9% of the initial efficiency after 40&#160;000 bending cycles at a 1&#160;mm radius, surpassing &#8776;83.5% for devices with 5% unmodified elastomer.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy Enables Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

This work proposes a facile three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single&#8208;component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;10&#8208;based three&#8208;in&#8208;one single&#8208;component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three&#8208;component and single&#8208;component devices, this work reports an innovative three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single&#8208;component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three&#8208;in&#8208;one system, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT).

     alt="Three-in-One Strategy Enables Single-Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a facile three-in-one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single-component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-10-based three-in-one single-component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two-component (PM6-D18:PYIT) and three-component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state-of-the-art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three-component and single-component devices, this work reports an innovative three-in-one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three-in-one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single-component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three-in-one system, the PM6-D18&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PYIT-based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two-component (PM6-D18:PYIT) and three-component (PM6:D18:PYIT). These results demonstrate that the three-in-one strategy is facile and promising for developing SCOSCs with superior efficiency and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The utilization of photothermal assistance principle presents significant opportunities for exploring the relationship between the photothermal effect of catalyst and their as&#8208;tuned comprehensive zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) properties at both normal and extreme working conditions (e.g., low temperature and deformation), and bridging the long&#8208;existing gap between the underlying mechanism of photothermal effect and advanced light&#8208;heat&#8208;electric&#8208;chemical energy conversion.








Abstract
Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field&#8208;responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 stably dispersed on N&#8208;doped Ketjenblack (Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/N&#8208;KB) is developed via polymer&#8208;assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;E is significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possesses comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement is attributed to the photothermal&#8208;heating&#8208;enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant&#8208;molecule motion, active area, and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation. The findings open vast possibilities toward more&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient energy applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Spirobifluorene Phosphonate Based Exciplex Interface Enables Voc Reaching 95% of Theoretical Limit for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exciplex interface is developed by the designed and synthesized spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in perovskite solar cells. The multi&#8208;functional spirobifluorene phosphonate based exciplex interface can promote hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, optimize energy band alignment, and reduce defect&#8208;induced recombination. A record VOC reaching 95% of theoretical limit and a high efficiency are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show significant advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs is limited by interfacial factors such as defect&#8208;induced recombination, energy band mismatch, and non&#8208;intimate interface contact. Here, an exciplex interface is first developed based on the strategically designed and synthesized two spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in PSCs. The exciplex interface constructed by the intimate contact between the multi&#8208;functional molecules and hole transport layer takes the roles to promote the hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, passivate coordination&#8208;unsaturated Pb2+ defects by equipped phosphonate groups, and optimize the energy level alignment. As a result, a record VOC of 1.26&#160;V with a perovskite bandgap of 1.61&#160;eV is achieved, representing over 95% of theoretical limit. This advancement leads to an increase in PCE from 21.29% to 24.12% and improved stability. The exciplex interface paves the way for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of VOC loss and promotes the wider application of PSCs.

         <title>A Fluoride&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like electrolyte is presented to enhance the overall performance of rechargeable Li&#8211;metal batteries. The triflate groups in its channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase that effectively stabilizes Li metal anodes. Besides, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport.








Abstract
To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, a fluoride&#8208;rich solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid&#8208;state and liquid electrolytes is presented. Its unique triflate&#8208;group&#8208;enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport, enabling a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and support a high critical current up to 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over 1 year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high&#8208;voltage cylindrical cells and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.

     alt="Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Nanodots&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis Suppression in Nucleus Pulposus for Antioxidant Intervention of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the primary instigators of pyroptosis and lack pharmacological intervention, advanced carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) are developed as ROS&#8208;scavenging biomaterials to efficiently suppress pyroptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and maintain NP tissue homeostasis for potential intervention in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).








Abstract
Low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent global concern; however, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analyses revealed the critical involvement of pyroptosis in IVDD. Considering the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary instigator of pyroptosis and the lack of an efficient intervention approach, this study developed carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) as ROS&#8208;scavenging catalytic biomaterials to suppress pyroptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells to efficiently alleviate IVDD. Catalytic MCDs have superior efficacy in scavenging intracellular ROS and rescuing homeostasis in the NP microenvironment compared with N&#8208;acetylcysteine, a classical antioxidant. The data validates that pyroptosis plays a vital role in mediating the protective effects of catalytic MCDs against oxidative stress. Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture&#8208;induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Endcapping of Hyperbranched Polymers toward Intrinsically Stretchable Semiconductors with Good Ductility and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; hyperbranched strategy is proposed for the development of intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymers. This approach hinders the formation of a homogeneous backbone and promotes the formation of small crystalline domains. The topology network establishes through endcapping branching not only enhances isotropic charge transport but also ensures tensile resistance. This strategy presents a promising approach for designing advanced intrinsically stretchable semiconductors.








Abstract
The advancement of semiconducting polymers stands as a pivotal milestone in the quest to realize wearable electronics. Nonetheless, endowing semiconductor polymers with stretchability without compromising their carrier mobility remains a formidable challenge. This study proposes a &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy for synthesizing hyperbranched semiconducting polymers (HBSPs), aiming to achieve the balance between carrier mobility and stretchability for organic electronics. The findings unveil that the aggregates formed by the endcapped hyperbranched network structure not only ensure efficient charge transport but also demonstrate superior tensile resistance. In comparison to linear conjugated polymers, HBSPs exhibit substantially larger crack onset strains and notably diminished tensile moduli. It is evident that the HBSPs surpass their linear counterparts in terms of both their semiconducting and mechanical properties. Among HBSPs, HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 stands out as the preeminent candidate within the field of inherently stretchable semiconducting polymers, maintaining 93% of its initial mobility even when subjected to 100% strain (1.41&#160;&#177;&#160;0.206&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, thin film devices of HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 remain stable after undergoing repeated stretching and releasing cycles. Notably, the mobilities are independent of the stretching directions, showing isotropic charge transport behavior. The preliminary study makes this &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy a potential candidate for the future design of organic materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Achieving Stable Lithium Anodes through Leveraging Inevitable Stress Variations via Adaptive Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical failures stemming from substantial volume fluctuations and stress concentration pose formidable challenges for lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To address this, the piezoelectric effect to transform these stresses into robust, responsive, and highly sensitive built&#8208;in electric fields is introduced. This work provides crucial insights in managing mechanical failures, and significantly contributes to characterizing and visualizing latent issues in lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Unleashing the potential of lithium&#8208;metal anodes in practical applications is hindered by the inherent stress&#8208;related challenges arising from their limitless volume expansion, leading to mechanical failures such as electrode cracking, solid electrolyte interphase damage, and dendritic growth.&#160;Despite the various protective strategies to &#8220;combat&#8221; stress in lithium&#8208;metal anodes, they fail to address the intrinsic issue fundamentally. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that leverages the stress generated during the battery cycling via the piezoelectric effect, transforming to the adaptive built&#8208;in electric field to accelerate lithium&#8208;ion migration, homogenize the lithium deposition, and alleviate the stress concentration. The mechanism of the piezoelectric effect in modulating electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution is further validated and decoupled through finite element method simulations. Inspired by this strategy, a high sensitivity, fast responsive, and strength adaptability polymer piezoelectric is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the corresponding protected lithium&#8208;metal anode shows cycling stability over 6000&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and extending life in a variety of coin and pouch cell systems. This work effectively tackles the stress&#8208;related issues and decoupling the electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution also contributes to developing more stable lithium anodes for future research.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Tellurium Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is demonstrated for aqueous zinc batteries with a highly concentrated ZnCl2 electrolyte, achieving a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. The reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion is disclosed with TeCl4 as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are potential candidates for sustainable energy storage systems at a grid scale, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the existing cathode chemistries exhibit restricted energy density, which hinders their extensive applications. Here, a tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is presented for aqueous zinc batteries, which delivers a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. A highly concentrated electrolyte (30&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 ZnCl2) is revealed crucial for initiating the Te redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion as it suppresses the H2O reactivity and inhibits undesirable hydrolysis of the Te4+ product. By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion with TeCl4 is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion&#8208;type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox&#8208;amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.

By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six-electron Te&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Te&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion with TeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion-type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox-amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HLCT&#8208;Type Acceptor Molecule&#8208;Based Exciplex System for Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processable OLEDs with Suppressed Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two HLCT emitters are synthesized as acceptor molecules in the exciplex system. By using the exciplex system as an emitter, a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diode achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using the exciplex as a host matrix for phosphors.








Abstract
Exciplex systems are promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules because of the small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST). However, realizing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency (EQE) roll&#8208;off in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using an exciplex system remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two (HLCT)&#8208;type isomers with a spiro skeleton, 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ, are designed and synthesized as acceptors of exciplexes, where tert&#8208;butylspirofluorene indole is regarded as a donor and the triazine unit as an acceptor. Green exciplex emissions are observed for the 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC exciplexes, indicating distinct TADF characteristics with a very small &#916;EST of 35 &#177; 5 meV. By using the TADF exciplex system based on the HLCT acceptor as an emitter, solution&#8208;processable OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off (&#8776;3.5% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2) is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using HLCT&#8208;based exciplexes as the host matrix of phosphors. This study paves the way for a novel strategy for designing acceptor exciplex molecules for effective TADF molecules and host matrices in solution&#8208;processable OLEDs.

         <title>Establishing Pinhole Deposition Mode of Zn via Scalable Monolayer Graphene Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing the specific role of graphene layer for Zn deposition is realized by high&#8208;quality graphene transfer, showcasing that the low lattice mismatch is barely a decisive factor for ideal epitaxial deposition and that the monolayer transferred graphene creates a unique pinhole deposition pattern, which harvests satisfactory battery lifespan






.

Abstract
The uneven texture evolution of Zn during electrodeposition would adversely impact upon the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. To address this issue, tremendous endeavors are made to induce Zn(002) orientational deposition employing graphene and its derivatives. Nevertheless, the effect of prototype graphene film over Zn deposition behavior has garnered less attention. Here, it is attempted to solve such a puzzle via utilizing transferred high&#8208;quality graphene film with controllable layer numbers in a scalable manner on a Zn foil. The multilayer graphene fails to facilitate a Zn epitaxial deposition, whereas the monolayer film with slight breakages steers a unique pinhole deposition mode. In&#8208;depth electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations discover that the transferred graphene film not only acts as an armor to inhibit side reactions but also serves as a buffer layer to homogenize initial Zn nucleation and decrease Zn migration barrier, accordingly enabling a smooth deposition layer with closely stacked polycrystalline domains. As a result, both assembled symmetric and full cells manage to deliver satisfactory electrochemical performances. This study proposes a concept of &#8220;pinhole deposition&#8221; to dictate Zn electrodeposition and broadens the horizons of graphene&#8208;modified Zn anodes.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Graphene Additive&#8208;Free Inks for 3D Printing Customizable Monolithic Integrated Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective, additive&#8208;free, highly robust, and environmentally friendly graphene ink is demonstrated for large&#8208;scale 3D printed MSCs, showing extremely high areal and volumetric energy density, high temperature stability, and good integration. This work provides a great reference value for the commercialization of graphene in the field of 3D printing.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technology with enhanced fidelity can achieve multiple functionalities and boost electrochemical performance of customizable planar micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs), however, precise structural control of additive&#8208;free graphene&#8208;based macro&#8208;assembly electrode for monolithic integrated MSCs (MIMSCs) remains challenging. Here, the large&#8208;scale 3D printing fabrication of customizable planar MIMSCs is reported utilizing additive&#8208;free, high&#8208;quality electrochemically exfoliated graphene inks, which is not required the conventional cryogenic assistance during the printing process and any post&#8208;processing reduction. The resulting MSCs reveal an extremely small engineering footprint of 0.025&#160;cm2, exceptionally high areal capacitance of 4900&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, volumetric capacitance of 195.6&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3, areal energy density of 2.1&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and unprecedented volumetric energy density of 23&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 for a single cell, surpassing most previously reported 3D printed MSCs. The 3D printed MIMSC pack is further demonstrated, with the maximum areal cell count density of 16&#160;cell&#160;cm&#8722;2, the highest output voltage of 192.5&#160;V and the largest output voltage per unit area of 56&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;2 up to date are achieved. This work presents an innovative solution for processing high&#8208;performance additive&#8208;free graphene ink and realizing the large&#8208;scale production of 3D printed MIMSCs for planar energy storage.

         <title>Synergy of Dendrites&#8208;Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi2O3 is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.








Abstract
The sluggish ions&#8208;transfer and inhomogeneous ions&#8208;nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi2O3, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, DODZn: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1) and negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 full&#8208;cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled&#8208;up Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable&#8208;energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal&#8208;based batteries.

     alt="Synergy of Dendrites-Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sluggish ions-transfer and inhomogeneous ions-nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, DOD&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte-to-capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and negative-to-positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full-cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled-up Zn@Bi/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable-energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Rapid&#8208;Formation Sprayable Hydrogels for Challenging Tissue Injury Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sought in medical scarcity situations, the hydrogel system offers rapid gelation and in situ spraying for treating extensive tissue injuries. Designed to address hemostasis, barrier establishment, and therapeutic treatment, the hydrogel forms in &lt;0.5 s, maintaining a balance between fluidity and mechanical strength. Its inherently bioactive includes osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis, providing innovative solutions for challenging tissue injury management.








Abstract
Rapid&#8208;acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex, and urgent injured tissues, is designed. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5 s under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavors to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propulsion by Directed Explosive Emulsification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach is introduced to create active droplets through a simple process of inducing symmetry&#8208;breaking oversaturation at the interface assembly. The partially oversaturated interfacial packing structure causes the asymmetrical explosive emulsification behavior and enables the directional movement of the droplet. The process exhibits autonomy, repeatability, and versatility in handling diverse nanoparticle compositions, making it highly promising for self&#8208;propulsion applications.








Abstract
An active droplet system, programmed to repeatedly move autonomously at a specific velocity in a well&#8208;defined direction, is demonstrated. Coulombic energy is stored in oversaturated interfacial assemblies of charged nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants by an applied DC electric field and can be released on demand. Spontaneous emulsification is suppressed by an increase in the stiffness of the oversaturated assemblies. Rapidly removing the field releases the stored energy in an explosive event that propels the droplet, where thousands of charged microdroplets are ballistically ejected from the surface of the parent droplet. The ejection is made directional by a symmetry breaking of the interfacial assembly, and the combined interaction force of the microdroplet plume on one side of the droplet propels the droplet distances tens of times its size, making the droplet active. The propulsion is autonomous, repeatable, and agnostic to the chemical composition of the nanoparticles. The symmetry&#8208;breaking in the nanoparticle assembly controls the microdroplet velocity and direction of propulsion. This mechanism of droplet propulsion will advance soft micro&#8208;robotics, establishes a new type of active matter, and introduces new vehicles for compartmentalized delivery.

         <title>Quantifying Dielectric Material Charge Trapping and De&#8208;Trapping Ability Via Ultra&#8208;Fast Charge Self&#8208;Injection Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

This work proposes an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on the air breakdown effect and introduces a general standard method to quantify traditional triboelectric materials' charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping effects.








Abstract
Recently, utilizing the air breakdown effect in the charge excitation strategy proves as an efficient charge injection technique to increase the surface charge density of dielectric polymers for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, quantitative characterization of the ability of dielectric polymers to trap reverse charges and the effect on the startup time of secondary self&#8208;charge excitation (SSCE) are essential for extensive applications. Here, an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on a self&#8208;charge excitation strategy is proposed, and a standard method to quantify the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping abilities of 23 traditional tribo&#8208;materials is introduced. Further, the relationship among the distribution of dielectric intrinsic deep, shallow trap states, and transportation of trapped charges is systematically analyzed in this article. It shows that the de&#8208;trapping rate of charges directly determines the reactivation and failure of SSCE. Last, independent of TENG contact efficiency, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 2.67 mC m&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;fast startup time of SSCE are obtained using a 15&#160;&#181;m poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) film, breaking the historical record for material modification. As a standard for material selection, this work quantifies the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping ability of the triboelectric dielectric series and provides insights for understanding the charge transport in dielectrics.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene with Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Driven and Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under broad&#8208;spectrum (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR) excitation, photogenerated electrons in semimetallic bismuthene migrate from the partially electronically occupied intermediate band to the lowest fully unoccupied empty band. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for CO2 adsorption/activation significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4.








Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum (ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared light) (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

Under &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation reaction to the near-infrared region (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Top Interface by Molecular Locking Strategy with Polydentate Chelating Biomaterials toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular locking strategy is proposed to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance. The DDPUD&#8208;modified device achieves an enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 23.17% to 24.47%.








Abstract
The instability of top interface induced by interfacial defects and residual tensile strain hinders the realization of long&#8208;term stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p regular perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, one molecular locking strategy is reported to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Both experimental and theoretical evidence collectively uncover that the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, halide vacancy, and/or I&#9472;Pb antisite defects can be effectively healed and locked by firm chemical anchoring on the surface of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, increased carrier lifetimes, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance, which should be liable for strengthened top interface stability and inhibited interfacial nonradiative recombination. The universality of the molecular locking strategy is certified by employing different perovskite compositions. The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17&#8211;24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD&#8208;modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10% of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65 &#176;C, respectively.

Gold Recovery
An artistic view of the recovery of gold from E&#8208;waste via a revisited version of The Kiss by Gustav Klimt. Dairy components (used for the adsorbing aerogel) are visible within the clothes of the man, while the woman's clothes are composed by gold ingots. The E&#8208;waste used for extracting gold lays as carpet, at the feet of the two lovers. More details can be found in article number 2310642 by Raffaele Mezzenga and co&#8208;workers.

Twisted Bilayer WS2
In article number 2313638, Xuetao Gan, Xuewen Wang, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an improved CVD setup for the direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0 to 120&#176; by utilizing tilted SiO2/Si substrates. The strong correlation between the second harmonic generation (SHG) response and the twist angle suggests a tunable SHG performance with twist angles.

3D Printing
In article number 2311917 by Hyun&#8208;Jong Paik, Wonjoo Lee, Min Sang Kwon, Dowon Ahn, and co&#8208;workers, panchromatic photopolymer resins, selectively reacting to two colors of lights, are developed and applied to realize photoactive 3D printing. Longer&#8208;wavelength of light (red light, &#8776;620 nm) irradiation initiates rapid photopolymerization and 3D printing, resulting in remarkable build speed and feature resolution. Incorporating violet/blue&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive moieties (&#8776;405&#8211;450 nm), such as hexaarylbiimidazoles, enable independent spatiotemporal degradation/erasing.

Liver Fibrosis
In article number 2310443, Zhengwei Mao, Yuan Ding, Weilin Wang, and co&#8208;workers constructed cell membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanoparticles (HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin and PM@PLGA@Melatonin NPs) using platelet membranes and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes. The release of melatonin targeting the inflamed liver during homing improves endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in the liver, significantly enhancing the therapeutic effect of liver fibrosis.

         <title>Multimodal Soft Robotic Actuation and Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are a promising direction to create machines capable of complex motion observed in living creatures. Designing soft actuators that perform a combination of multiple actuation modalities allows them to perform intricate tasks. Then, applying multimodal actuators into soft robotics is conducive toward developing robots with multimodal gaits of locomotion that adapt to various environments for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Diverse and adaptable modes of complex motion observed at different scales in living creatures are challenging to reproduce in robotic systems. Achieving dexterous movement in conventional robots can be difficult due to the many limitations of applying rigid materials. Robots based on soft materials are inherently deformable, compliant, adaptable, and adjustable, making soft robotics conducive to creating machines with complicated actuation and motion gaits. This review examines the mechanisms and modalities of actuation deformation in materials that respond to various stimuli. Then, strategies based on composite materials are considered to build toward actuators that combine multiple actuation modes for sophisticated movements. Examples across literature illustrate the development of soft actuators as free&#8208;moving, entirely soft&#8208;bodied robots with multiple locomotion gaits via careful manipulation of external stimuli. The review further highlights how the application of soft functional materials into robots with rigid components further enhances their locomotive abilities. Finally, taking advantage of the shape&#8208;morphing properties of soft materials, reconfigurable soft robots have shown the capacity for adaptive gaits that enable transition across environments with different locomotive modes for optimal efficiency. Overall, soft materials enable varied multimodal motion in actuators and robots, positioning soft robotics to make real&#8208;world applications for intricate and challenging tasks.

         <title>Sensing, Imaging, and Therapeutic Strategies Endowing by Conjugate Polymers for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced conjugated polymers (CPs) are widely used in biomedical applications due to their excellent light absorption, high fluorescence quantum yield, and stability. This paper presents research advances in CPs for biological detection, imaging, therapeutics, and bio&#8208;electronic device fabrication. Through this review, it is hoped to provide cutting&#8208;edge information for basic research and clinical translation of CPs&#8208;based detection methods and technologies.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real&#8208;time imaging diagnosis, and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are first discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs&#8208;based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically. Finally, recent advancements in utilizing CPs as electroactive materials for bioelectronic devices are also investigated. Moreover, the challenges and outlooks of CPs for precision medicine are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is hoped to highlight the frontier progress of CPs and promote new breakthroughs in fundamental research and clinical transformation.

         <title>Engineering and Targeting Neutrophils for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in engineering neutrophils and their derivatives as drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. Targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) and reinvigorating anti&#8208;tumor immunity provide a broad understanding of the potential application of neutrophils in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation and act as the first line of defense against infections. Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils possess heterogeneous phenotypes and functional plasticity in human health and diseases, including cancer. Neutrophils play multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression, and an N1/N2 paradigm of neutrophils in cancer is proposed, where N1 neutrophils exert anti&#8208;tumor properties while N2 neutrophils display tumor&#8208;supportive and immune&#8208;suppressive functions. Selective activation of beneficial neutrophil population and targeted inhibition or re&#8208;polarization of tumor&#8208;promoting neutrophils has shown an important potential in tumor therapy. In addition, due to the natural inflammation&#8208;responsive and physical barrier&#8208;crossing abilities, neutrophils and their derivatives (membranes and extracellular vesicles (EVs)) are regarded as advanced drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, the recent advances in engineering neutrophils for drug delivery and targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) are comprehensively presented. This review will provide a broad understanding of the potential of neutrophils in cancer therapy.

         <title>Engineering Biomaterials to Model Immune&#8208;Tumor Interactions In Vitro</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Engineered biomaterial scaffolds are becoming more prominent in research laboratories to study drug efficacy for oncological applications in vitro, but do they have a place in pharmaceutical drug screening pipelines? The low efficacy of cancer drugs in phase II/III clinical trials suggests that there are critical mechanisms not properly accounted for in the pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Immune cells associated with the tumor may account for some of these failures given recent successes with cancer immunotherapies; however, there are few representative platforms to study immune cells in the context of cancer as traditional 2D culture is typically monocultures and humanized animal models have a weakened immune composition. Biomaterials that replicate tumor microenvironmental cues may provide a more relevant model with greater in vitro complexity. In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered tissues.

         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively highlights recent breakthroughs and critical milestones regarding the controllable synthesis processes, fluorescence origins, and cancer imaging or therapy applications of different families of nanocarbons: zero&#8208;dimensional carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and two&#8208;dimensional carbon nanohorns.








Abstract
Nanocarbons are emerging at the forefront of nanoscience, with diverse carbon nanoforms emerging over the past two decades. Early cancer diagnosis and therapy, driven by advanced chemistry techniques, play a pivotal role in mitigating mortality rates associated with cancer. Nanocarbons, with an attractive combination of well&#8208;defined architectures, biocompatibility, and nanoscale dimension, offer an incredibly versatile platform for cancer imaging and therapy. This paper aims to review the underlying principles regarding the controllable synthesis, fluorescence origins, cellular toxicity, and surface functionalization routes of several classes of nanocarbons: carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and carbon nanohorns. This review also highlights recent breakthroughs regarding the green synthesis of different nanocarbons from renewable sources. It also presents a comprehensive and unified overview of the latest cancer&#8208;related applications of nanocarbons and how they can be designed to interface with biological systems and work as cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools. The commercial status for large&#8208;scale manufacturing of nanocarbons is also presented. Finally, it proposes future research opportunities aimed at engendering modifiable and high&#8208;performance nanocarbons for emerging applications across medical industries. This work is envisioned as a cornerstone to guide interdisciplinary teams in crafting fluorescent nanocarbons with tailored attributes that can revolutionize cancer diagnostics and therapy.

         <title>Improve the Charge Carrier Transporting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the charge carrier transport in two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite solar cells, this review shows the relevant progress from bandgap regulation, phase orientation and distribution, amine molecule selection, and energy level matching from the perspective of 2D perovskite structural properties. Finally, the possible future research directions and methods to achieve efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are rationalized.








Abstract
Conventional 3D organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite materials have shown substantial potential in the field of optoelectronics, enabling the power conversation efficiency of solar cells beyond 26%. A key challenge limiting the further commercial application of 3D perovskite solar cells is their inherent instability over outer oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.

By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high-efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Analysis and Structural Determination of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of covalent organic frameworks can be seen as periodic nets. First, some basic concepts about periodic nets and topology are introduced, and then the topological rules of reported 3D COFs are analyzed and summarized. Furthermore, the structural determination methods of 3D COFs is described, and finally, some prospects toward the structural problem of 3D COFs are proposed.








Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) constitute a new type of crystalline materials that consist of a range of porous structures with numerous applications in the fields of adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because of the complexity of the three&#8208;periodic net structure, it is desirable to develop a thorough structural comprehension, along with a means to precisely determine the actual structure. Indeed, such advancements would considerably contribute to the rational design and application of 3D COFs. In this review, the reported topologies of 3D COFs are introduced and categorized according to the configurations of their building blocks, and a comprehensive overview of diffraction&#8208;based structural determination methods is provided. The current challenges and future prospects for these materials will also be discussed.

         <title>Functional Amyloids: The Biomaterials of Tomorrow?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional amyloid from bacteria, particularly CsgA and FapC, are emerging as promising new biomaterials with applications within areas as diverse as gastrointestinal colonization, tissue engineering, water purification, CO2 fixation, biosensing, and more recently biocatalysis. This is thanks to their high stability, efficient and controllable formation, easy and scalable availability and ready engineering opportunities.








Abstract
Functional amyloid (FAs), particularly the bacterial proteins CsgA and FapC, have many useful properties as biomaterials: high stability, efficient, and controllable formation of a single type of amyloid, easy availability as extracellular material in bacterial biofilm and flexible engineering to introduce new properties. CsgA in particular has already demonstrated its worth in hydrogels for stable gastrointestinal colonization and regenerative tissue engineering, cell&#8208;specific drug release, water&#8208;purification filters, and different biosensors. It also holds promise as catalytic amyloid; existing weak and unspecific activity can undoubtedly be improved by targeted engineering and benefit from the repetitive display of active sites on a surface. Unfortunately, FapC remains largely unexplored and no application is described so far. Since FapC shares many common features with CsgA, this opens the window to its development as a functional scaffold. The multiple imperfect repeats in CsgA and FapC form a platform to introduce novel properties, e.g., in connecting linkers of variable lengths. While exploitation of this potential is still at an early stage, particularly for FapC, a thorough understanding of their molecular properties will pave the way for multifunctional fibrils which can contribute toward solving many different societal challenges, ranging from CO2 fixation to hydrolysis of plastic nanoparticles.

         <title>Responsively Degradable Nanoarmor&#8208;Assisted Super Resistance and Stable Colonization of Probiotics for Enhanced Inflammation&#8208;Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior armored probiotic (EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA) with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease. EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA shows excellent prophylactic efficacy and therapeutic performance against dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced colitis including alleviating inflammation, restoring intestinal barrier function, and reshaping the dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria.








Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Intense Left&#8208;handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Nematic Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Composite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) derived luminescent materials exhibit intense and multicolored left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (CPL), opening the way for the practical application of nanocellulosic chirality in durable multimode anticounterfeiting and enantioselective photopolymerization. The versatility, high glum, and large &#934; of this system will promote its applications in chiral sensing, chiroptical devices, 3D display technologies, and CPL chiral imaging.








Abstract
Integrating optically active components into chiral photonic cellulose to fabricate circularly polarized luminescent materials has transformative potential in disease detection, asymmetric reactions, and anticounterfeiting techniques. However, the lack of cellulose&#8208;based left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (L&#8208;CPL) emissions hampers the progress of these chiral functionalizations. Here, this work proposes an unprecedented strategy: incorporating a chiral nematic organization of hydroxypropyl cellulose with robust aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens to generate intense L&#8208;CPL emission. By utilizing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as a good solvent for fluorescent components and cellulose matrices, this work produces a right&#8208;handed chiral nematic structure film with a uniform appearance in reflective and fluorescent states. Remarkably, this system integrates a high asymmetric factor (0.51) and an impressive emission quantum yield (55.8%) into one fascinating composite. More meaningfully, this approach is versatile, allowing for the incorporation of luminogen derivatives emitting multicolored L&#8208;CPL. These chiral fluorescent films possess exceptional mechanical flexibility (toughness up to 0.9 MJ m&#8722;3) and structural stability even under harsh environmental exposures, making them promising for the fabrication of various products. Additionally, these films can be cast on the fabrics to reveal multilevel and durable anticounterfeiting capabilities or used as a chiral light source to induce enantioselective photopolymerization, thereby offering significant potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid additive is proposed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi&#8208;transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST&#8208;OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency.

&lt;p&gt;A novel solid additive is proposed to dual-regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi-transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST-OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record-breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.

Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE).

         <title>Engineering a Dynamic Solvent&#8208;Phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal surface (Li&#8211;PFbTHF) is developed to improve the cycling performance of practical Li metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes. Evidence from advanced techniques indicated that the C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups of PFbTHF induce LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long&#8208;term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.








Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Interlayer Biatomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of 2D Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve 100% activation is reported of atoms on the basal plane of 2D layered materials by constructing an interlayer biatomic bridge. New gap states at the Fermi level are introduced and interlayer conductivity is enhanced in this catalyst. Exposed basal plane atoms are optimized to a state favorable for adsorbing catalytic intermediates.








Abstract
2D layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane with saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, a novel approach is reported to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer biatomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results from the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV). This study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid&#8208;state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine&#8208;tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.








Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self&#8208;adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg&#160;m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1 with a high efficiency of 93.7% under 1&#160;sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.

Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self-regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M&#8208;EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion&#8208;detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion&#8208;detecting element for edge&#8208;level neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

         <title>Competing Mechanisms Determine Oxygen Redox in Doped Ni&#8211;Mn Based Layered Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the well&#8208;known P2 to O2 phase transition, oxygen redox is a main bottleneck for capacity retention. Using synchrotron&#8208;based methods, it is revealed that competing mechanisms between Ni and Mg (or Li, Zn, and Cu) are critical for controlling the degree of oxygen redox in doped Ni&#8211;Mn based layered oxides in Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cation doping is an effective strategy for improving the cyclability of layered oxide cathode materials through suppression of phase transitions in the high voltage region. In this study, Mg and Sc are chosen as dopants in P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, and both have found to&#160;positively impact the cycling stability, but influence the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based methods and theoretical calculations it is shown that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity is also a critical aspect that dictates the performance. With Mg doping, the Ni activity can be enhanced while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn&#8208;based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. This contradiction is addressed by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33&#8208;xMn0.67O2 (x&#160;&lt;&#160;0&#160;&lt;&#160;0.33). These findings provide a new direction in understanding the effects of cation doping on the electrochemical behavior of layered oxides.

         <title>Physically and Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a pivotal component within solar devices, the electrode has a profound impact on the device performance. Herein, device configuration based on the physically and chemically stable molybdenum electrode is engineered to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in perovskite solar cells. A titanium seed layer is further introduced to optimize the electrode interfacial contact. 








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrate the high diffusion barrier of Mo ions within the device. Structural and morphology characterization also reveals the negligible plastic deformation and halide&#8208;metal reaction during aging when Mo is in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction is further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C60/SnO2/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which is among the highest value for PSCs based on Mo electrodes. Meanwhile, the device shows negligible performance decay after 2000 h operation, and retains 91% of the initial value after 1300 h at 50&#8211;60 &#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opens an effective avenue to all&#8208;round stable electrode design in high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitor with Enhanced Sustainability and Safety Based on Bio&#8208;Based &#436;&#8208;Valerolactone and Lithium Bis(Oxalato)Borate Electrolyte</title>

When fluorine&#8208;free meets bio&#8208;based: the suitable combination of a fluorine&#8208;free lithium bis(oxalato)borate salt with a bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone solvent is demonstrated in this work. This novel and sustainable electrolyte not only presents enhanced safety and the ability to prevent aluminum dissolution, but also enables the realization of lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with excellent energy&#8208;to&#8208;power performance and outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 m LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

&lt;p&gt;When fluorine-free meets bio-based: the suitable combination of a fluorine-free lithium &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(oxalato)borate salt with a bio-based &#436;-valerolactone solvent is demonstrated in this work. This novel and sustainable electrolyte not only presents enhanced safety and the ability to prevent aluminum dissolution, but also enables the realization of lithium-ion capacitors with excellent energy-to-power performance and outstanding long-term stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio-based &#436;-valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery-type and capacitive-type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full-cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine-free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy-to-power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;AM&lt;/sub&gt; at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;AM&lt;/sub&gt; along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post-mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Multicolor Emissions of the Coumarin&#8208;Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals and LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing coumarin molecule, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum are systemically prepared. The Cs3EuCl6 NC can achieve an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. Here, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are systemically prepared. Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6&#8208;NC&#8208;based red light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven microrobotic superstructure is designed for navigation in microscale environments. The superstructure consists of microhelices interlocked with a gelatin composite chassis containing iron oxide nanoparticles. The helices serve as the motion component, while the nanoparticles enable the gelatin to dissolve via magnetic hyperthermia. Upon dissolution, the helices are released and navigate through smaller conduits using a rotating field.








Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, a microrobotic superstructure is proposed, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). The superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field, is showcased. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which can be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.








Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor endothelial expression of CD93 inversely correlates with the tumor vasculature normalization and immune activation. Ultrasound molecular imaging CD93 using targeted MBs armed with MMRN2, an endogenous ligand of CD93, provides a noninvasive and accurate strategy to evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and predict immunotherapy response.








Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics, able to predict immune microenvironment, is important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consist a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane (CM) /lipid hybrid membrane is then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93-targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93-targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;shaped flexible temperature sensors with outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics (broad working range and high sensitivity) are achieved through a two&#8208;step synthetic method. The temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in various applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.








Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8211;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method is introduced for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15 to 60&#160;&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;Dependent Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Scintillation for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenothiazine derivatives exhibiting intriguing polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescent radioluminescence features in the crystal under X&#8208;ray irradiation are synthesized. The results reveal that stabilizing triplet excitons by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can achieve efficient X&#8208;ray phosphorescent scintillation. The low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1 of resulting scintillators demonstrates the potential of flexible and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescent scintillating materials have shown great potential for applications in radiography and radiation detection due to their efficient utilization of excitons. However, revealing the relationship between molecule stacking and the phosphorescent radioluminescence of scintillators is still challenging. This study reports on two phenothiazine derivatives with polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescence radioluminescence. The experiments reveal that molecule stacking significantly affects the non&#8208;radiation decay of the triplet excitons of scintillators, which further determines the phosphorescence scintillation performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These phosphorescent scintillators exhibit high radio stability and have a low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1. Additionally, the potential application of these scintillators in X&#8208;ray radiography, based on their X&#8208;ray excited radioluminescence properties, is demonstrated. These findings provide a guideline for obtaining high&#8208;performance phosphorescent scintillating materials by shedding light on the effect of crystal packing on the radioluminescence of organic molecules.

         <title>Breaking&#8208;Down Tumoral Physical Barrier by Remotely Unwrapping Metal&#8208;Polyphenol&#8208;Packaged Hyaluronidase for Optimizing Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here, the authors propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged hyaluronidase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes.








Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here a remotely unwrapping strategy is proposed of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH can be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation, and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ion transporting membranes enhance power density during osmotic energy conversion. In this study, positively charged propidium&#8208;based 2D polymer membranes are synthesized with both skeleton and intrinsic space charges. When mixing artificial seawater and river water, a great power density of 48 W m&#8722;2 is achieved, surpassing the performance of most nanofluidic membranes.








Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8776;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

         <title>Functionality Modulation Toward Thianthrene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodical functionality modulation is carried out to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The incorporation of cyanovinylene linkage enhances the hydrophilicity and stability of the porous polymers. Furthermore, a gradual insertion of electroactive moieties into the structural backbone leads to the construction of a hollow spherical porous polymer as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, a systematic strategy is introduced for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C&#9552;C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of &#8776;65 mV (in 0.5 m H2SO4) and &#8776;283 mV (in 1 m KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibits superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions above Room Temperature in a van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 are observed through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy . Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range. Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach is employed to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions are observed in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8211;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. The research establishes Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pivoting to advanced computational methods accelerates the discovery of optimal proton conductors. Calculations predict that BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) exhibits superior conductivity and stability over existing materials. Experimental studies confirm these insights, demonstrating outstanding performance in BSCYb&#8208;based protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). This research underscores the potential of computational methodologies in propelling more efficient PCEC systems for power generation and fuel production.









Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here, this work reports the findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. This work methodically computes the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, these findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate the computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600 &#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600 &#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000&#8208;h when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Mechanical Disruption of &#946;&#8208;Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibers using Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>

A light&#8208;driven rotary motor is co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels. Upon UV irradiation, the work produced by the continuous rotation of the motor is shown to disrupt the hydrogen bonds of the self&#8208;assembled system, leading to an endergonic gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. The structure of the original hydrogel is subsequently recovered in the dark.








Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here, it is shown that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25 &#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8211;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

         <title>Boosting the Performances of Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics via Synergetic Near&#8208;Infrared Light Management</title>

Core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2&#160;nanotripods significantly enhance photon absorption in the NIR range for semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. An optical coupling&#160;multilayer&#160;consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) enhances the NIR light utilization and the visible transparency. These strategies&#160;result in a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% along with an excellent AVT of over 30%, correspond to the record LUE of 5.33%.









Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, the authors take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, it is shown that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8776;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. Its type&#8208;II multiferroic order arises from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These results on magnetoelectric effects at the atomic scale suggest new ways to engineer multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. It is demonstrated that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Nonlocal Acoustic Moir&#233; Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological transition in twisted bilayer materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found experimentally due to the inherent scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a nonlocal design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces.








Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of acoustic pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tunable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. A twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface is also experimentally demonstrated, and more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves are found. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena that are observed.

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&#8722;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real&#8208;time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity.

&lt;p&gt;Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real-time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB-DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real-time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>

This work demonstrates the design insight into the peroxymonosulfate activation system by boosting the mass transfer performance within hydrogel interfaces for ultrafast water purification.








Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8776;6&#8211;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications is proposed. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an effective and controllable H2&#8208;based nanocatalytic treatment strategy in which biocompatible Au@BT NPs are constructed to catalyze H2 generation in response to ultrasound exposure to achieve anti&#8208;inflammatory effect through scavenging ROS; thus, achieving a notable therapeutic improvement in their motor function.








Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) proves to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs show adverse side effects which may induce increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability, and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) is synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Further, theoretical calculations are employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticle is first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 generation; thus, offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shells with tunable structural features for direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) based recording of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs), enabling both early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC). This work highlights the synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.








Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates are developed for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;Thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;Infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is fabricated via a microfluidic chip based on the freeze&#8208;thaw strategy. For infected macrophages, TNC releases heme to reconstruct the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.








Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate the Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust approach that utilizes single particle diffusion fingerprinting of quantum dots, along with machine learning, to map brain extracellular space features and predict the efficacy of drugs against viral encephalitis is developed.








Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, a robust approach is developed using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. These results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for the clinical translation of drugs.

         <title>Mitocytosis Mediated by an Enzyme&#8208;Activable Mitochondrion&#8208;Disturbing Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugate Enhances Active Penetration in Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activable mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine assembled from an amphiphilic block polymer&#8208;drug conjugate is developed for achieving efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing and deep glioblastoma (GBM) penetration. This nanomedicine interferes mitochondrial homeostasis, which mediates the process of mitocytosis for mitochondrial quality control, facilitating mitosome&#8208;mediated active transcellular transport in GBM tissues.








Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22&#8208;b&#8208;pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8211;blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Monolithic 2D Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new persistent photocurrent mechanism based on ion motion and ion&#8208;exciton coupling is proposed in two dimensional perovskites. The special charge carrier dynamics lead to the bio&#8208;plausible synaptic characteristics of the photodetectors. The light&#8208;tunable synaptic plasticity enables not only to realize image preprocessing, but also effectively recognizes target images by learning critical features.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture, and on&#8208;chip integration. Here a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling is innovated to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90&#160;s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be&#8776;1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>

Linked electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers are constructed alternately and introduce electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into the side chains of electron donors to mediate the active sites responsible for water oxidation. Under anaerobic conditions, its H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency via water oxidation reaction reaches an impressive 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. Remarkably, the photocatalyst achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. In situ, photosynthesis of it in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8211;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors is introduced. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Highly Flexible, High&#8208;Performance, and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8208;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>

         <dc:description>
Schematic showing the development of stretchable hierarchical ceramic sensors through a novel soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy, whose configuration ensures excellent mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric activity and structural robustness, including a linear response, wide&#8208;angle twisting, and wide range of stretching. This new sensor is successfully used for both wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.








Abstract
Stretchable self&#8208;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability. In this paper, a biomimetic soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy is used to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8208;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8208;shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Carbon Activation: Creating Porosity without Etching Using Cesium Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient synthetic strategy is proposed for highly porous carbons with a high yield of 25% and a specific surface area of 3008 m2 g&#8722;1 upon thermal treatment of carboxylic acids and Cs2CO3. The unconventional roles of Cs species are unraveled as an electron injector and intercalation agent to promote the formation of carbonaceous frameworks and porous structures.








Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area (SSA) from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt;20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high SSAs are targeted (&gt;2000 m2 g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, a non&#8208;etching activation strategy is demonstrated using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and SSAs reaching 3008 m2 g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation, and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh g&#8722;1 (567 F g&#8722;1) and durability of 100&#160;000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Bioengineered Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CellUs integrates live neutrophils enveloping a liposomal formulation of antibiotic ceftriaxone, steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug dexamethasone, and oxygen&#8208;loaded perfluorocarbon, for treating brain infections. CellUs leverages the natural chemotactic property of neutrophils to penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier, accurately targets infection sites, and synchronizes the release of therapeutic agents under the ultrasound stimulation, thereby combating both bacterial infection and excess inflammatory cytokines.








Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs,&#8221; is pioneered. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents, and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics by Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional intelligent design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to study the influence of local polarity heterogeneity on the energy storage performance in BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics. By reversely optimization, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems with nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions. 








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of polarity&#160;heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, this work establishes the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, this work analyzes the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning polarity heterogeneity.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high&#8208;amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.








Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range.

&lt;p&gt;Air-coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high-amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time-of-flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non-destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non-contact through-transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infinite Self&#8208;Propulsion of Circularly On/Discharged Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the superhydrophobic surface printed with symmetrical waved alternating potential, the droplets can be circularly charged or discharged during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000 mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propulsion of droplets in a controlled and long path at a high&#8208;speed is crucial for organic synthesis, pathological diagnosis and programable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. To date, extensive efforts have been made to achieve droplet self&#8208;propulsion by asymmetric gradient, yet, existing structural, chemical, or charge density gradients can only last for a while (&lt;50&#160;mm). Here, this work designs a symmetrical waved alternating potential (WAP) on a superhydrophobic surface to charge or discharge the droplets during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000&#160;mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second. In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ni3+/Ni2+&#8208;mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), resulting in a record&#8208;high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni2P4O12/NiTe as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts (Ni2P4O12/NiTe || Ni2P4O12/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.475 V over 500 h.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma enabled low&#8208;temperature synthesis (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C) of various mesoporous metal oxide (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, WO3, Nb2O5, and MoO3), suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. As a proof of concept, the direct synthesis of mesoporous V2O5 is demonstrated on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated polyimide film and its application as electrode materials.








Abstract
Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and are widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches are reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C), which can be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate is introduced. As a demonstration, a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor is fabricated by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance is well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The multi&#8208;output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.








Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full&#8208;current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial Fe3GeTe2 synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern.

     alt="Current-Controllable and Reversible Multi-Resistance-State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi-output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The multi-output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the multi-state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all-electric functional nanodevices with multi-state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full-current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance-state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi-domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full-current-driven artificial Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synapses with multi-state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

         <title>The Unique Fe3Mo3N Structure Bestowed Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Performance of the Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Double Enhancement of Radicals and Nonradicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the unique Fe3Mo3N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton&#8208;like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts are widely used in Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon&#8208;based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe2.5Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton&#8208;like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon&#8208;based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe3Mo3N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO4&#183;&#8722;) and nonradicals (1O2 and electron transport process). The integrated &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; combined material is expected to provide a new promotion strategy for Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Dipoles Regulate Anion&#8208;Derived Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After thermal reduction, BaTiO3 with surface oxygen vacancies (BTOV) exhibits stimulative adsorption and polarization for TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; due to enhanced dipoles. With the BTOV on the polypropylene separator, a locally anion&#8208;rich and Li+&#8208;rich region is formed at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface, which will promote the transport of Li+. Moreover, polarized anions are reduced promotively to form an expected SEI film.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are considered the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage devices of the next generation. However, the unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from electrolytes usually leads to high impedance, Li dendrites growth, and poor cyclability. Herein, the ferroelectric BaTiO3 with orderly arranged dipoles (BTOV) is integrated into the polypropylene separator as a functional layer. Detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that surface oxygen vacancies drive the phase transition of BaTiO3 materials and promote the ordered arrangement of dipoles. The strong dipole moments in BTOV can adsorb TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; anions selectively and promote their preferential reduction to form a SEI film enriched with inorganic LiF and LiNxOy species, thus facilitating the rapid transfer of Li+ and restraining the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the Li&#8211;Li cell with the BTOV functional layer exhibits enhanced Li plating/stripping cycling with an ultra&#8208;long life of over 7000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiFePO4 || Li (50&#160;&#181;m) full cells display excellent cycling performance exceeding 1760 cycles and superior rate performance. This work provides a new perspective for regulating SEI chemistry by introducing ordered dipoles to control the distribution and reaction of anions.

The mass activity and turnover frequency value of OER for Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2&#8208;C and Cu2IrOx&#8208;A. 








Abstract
Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis, however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is formidably challenging. This article proposes a robust strategy for fabricating 3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by other binary oxides. When Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) is used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2 and Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels leads to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6]. This work may attract immediate interest of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis, and beyond.

         <title>Steering CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products via Enhancing Localized *CO Coverage and Local Pressure in Conical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful construction of open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) imparts structural confinement to the catalysts, enabling concentrated carbon intermediates and facilitating smooth efflux of products along the curved sides. The nanosheet&#8208;stacked Cu2O sphere (NS&#8208;Cu2O) achieves an enhanced selectivity toward C2+ products with a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.7% at a partial current density of 286 mA cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, a catalyst featuring a nanosheet&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) is reported. Under the guidance of the finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, it is shown that exerting control over the confinement space results in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibit a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multicarbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

         <title>Development of Inverse&#8208;Opal&#8208;Structured Charge&#8208;Deficient Co9S8@nitrogen&#8208;Doped&#8208;Carbon to Catalytically Enable High Energy and High Power for the Two&#8208;Electron Transfer I+/I&#8722; Electrode</title>

An inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) is developed as a catalytic host of the iodine electrode, specifically targeting improved reaction kinetics for the two&#8208;electron transfer cascade reaction. The inherent charge&#8208;deficient nature of Co9S8@NC effectively lowers the activation energy required for the conversion reaction and enhances the physicochemical adsorption of active iodine species, leading to superior electrochemical performance even at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.








Abstract
The iodine (I) electrode involving two&#8208;electron transfer chemistry by converting between I+ and I&#8722;, has the potential to deliver theoretically doubled capacity and higher working voltage platforms, thus achieving higher energy density. However, owing to the slow kinetics of the cascade two&#8208;electron transfer reactions, the system suffers from large overpotentials and low power density, especially at high working currents and low temperatures. Here, an inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) catalyst with unique charge&#8208;deficient states is developed to promote the reaction kinetics of the I&#8722;/I+ electrode. The charge&#8208;deficient Co9S8@NC catalyst not only enables strong physicochemical adsorption with the iodine species but also significantly reduces the activation energy and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the cascade I+/I0/I&#8722; conversion reaction. Consequently, the prototypical Zn&#8214;I+/I0/I&#8722; battery equipped with the Co9S8@NC catalyst can deliver a high energy density of 554 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a stable cycle life of 5000 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, at a subzero temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C, the battery can exhibit enhanced kinetics and a high power density of 1514 W kg&#8722;1, high energy density of 485 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells has made the performance of p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure devices develop rapidly, while the relationship of function group, anchor groups, and spacers often is neglected. It is found that anchoring groups and spacers can affect the coordination between SAMs and perovskite. This work demonstrates different components of perovskites are selective to SAMs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The anchoring of SAMs at the conductiv metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, SAMs molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs are selected. It is found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favorable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This results in reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length leads to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs show efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retain 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 h. Overall, this work highlights the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;Based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable sensor able to monitor in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals, associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, is demonstrated. The device is based on hexagonal boron nitride inks made by non&#8208;covalent functionalization with pyrene derivatives, enabling to strongly enhance the sensitivity to water molecules, and device stability.








Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow for real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2Dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water, and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, strong hysteresis, low sensitivity, and cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets is demonstrated. The device shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity (RH) (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100% RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis, and no cross&#8208;sensitivity with temperature&#160;in the range of 25&#8211;60 &#176;C. The h&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real&#8208;time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Mechanical Stimulation of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory and Antioxidant Hydrogels for Rapid Re&#8208;Epithelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with natural anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties is reported. The hydrogel possesses outstanding mechanical properties and can be further enhanced by water. In a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the hydrogels achieve effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium combining mechanical stimulation and immunoregulation.








Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine, and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles is reported. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments show that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization is ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieves effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Amorphous MnO2 Lamellae Encapsulated Covalent Triazine Polymer&#8208;Derived Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped Carbon for ORR/OER Bifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is fabricated through a self&#8208;doping process coupled with in situ encapsulating strategy. Due to the predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and the abundance of multi&#8208;heteroatom catalytic active sites, the as&#8208;developed A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC can readily work as an oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction dual&#8208;functional electrocatalyst for both liquid and solid rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery.








Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1, and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions and beyond.

         <title>Multiple Cations Nanoconfinement in Ultrathin V2O5 Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics Toward High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, supramolecular&#160;self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to intercalate unitary cation including NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+ and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) in ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets. The success on multiple cations nanoconfinement enables very fast zinc ion diffusion kinetics and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. The optimized diffusion coefficient of zinc ion (7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date.








Abstract
Nanoconfinement of cations in layered oxide cathode is an important approach to realize advanced zinc ion storage performance. However, thus far, the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal route for this nanoconfinement has been restricted to its uncontrollable phase structure and the difficulty on the multiple cation co&#8208;confinement simultaneously. Herein, this work reports a general, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets using various unitary cations including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, NH4+, and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ +Mg2+). The unitary cation confinement results in a remarkable increase in the specific capacity and Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, and the multiple cation confinement gives rise to superior structural and cycling stability by multiple cation synergetic pillaring effect. The optimized diffusion coefficient of Zn&#8208;ion (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date. The work develops a novel multiple&#8208;cations nanoconfinement strategy toward high&#8208;performance cathode for aqueous battery. It also provides new insights into the guest cation regulation of zinc&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics through a general, supramolecular assembly pathway.

         <title>Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation&#8208;Expansion&#8208;Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long&#8208;Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Microencapsulation of PbI2 and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI2&#8208;ammonium salt reaction through poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high&#8208;quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.








Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3. Moreover, profiting from the protection of poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite is markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gain a robust power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintain 91% of their initial PCE for 13&#160;008 h in a desiccated ambient environment and retain 92% PCE after storage for 4000 h with a relative humidity of 50 &#177; 10%, which is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art long&#8208;term stability among the reported contributions.

         <title>Piezoionic Elastomers by Phase and Interface Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Energy&#8208;Harvesting Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents phase and interface engineering to design piezoionic elastomers with integrated microphase&#8208;separated structures and an intermediate phase. It addresses the significant challenges associated with harmonizing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability in piezoionic and piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasisolid states. Herein, phase and interface engineering strategy is introduced to address this dilemma and a piezoionic elastomer is presented that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#181;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, this elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Control of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) is observed in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. The output of one of the CSI components switches off with the commensurability of the CDW phases. First&#8208;principles calculations support that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI.








Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long&#8208;range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although the understanding of the fundamental character of CDW is enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures is shown by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions is observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears, and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. The results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II) oxalate as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride is used to regulate the hot carrier cooling kinetics, increase the carrier diffusion length, and prolong the carrier lifetime. Based on this strategy, the champion efficiencies of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are 23.36% and 27.56%, accompanied by significantly improved long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells; However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) is introduced into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices show excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relationship between the molecular structure and the vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology of PPHJ OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge is first established. A ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP is elaborately constructed to achieve better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, resulting in impressive efficiency of 19.09%.








Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs is established by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. The morphological evolution mechanism is revealed by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors (Ds) and acceptors (As). The findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, it is also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP leads to enhanced miscibility between Ds and As, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, a ternary PPHJ device is meticulously designed with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and an impressive efficiency of 19.09% is achieved. This work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, not only the formation of VPS morphology can be controlled, but also energy losses can be reduced, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

CD93&#8208;Targeted Microbubbles
In article number 2310421, Qiuyang Li, Lijun Yuan, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel ultrasound contrast microbubble for evaluation of immune status through molecular imaging of endothelial CD93 expression. High levels of CD93 in tumor vasculature correlate well with immune cell infiltration deficiency, and ultrasound imaging of CD93 with MMRN2&#8208;modified microbubbles holds as a promising strategy to assess the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.

On&#8208;Skin Electronics
In article number 2308831, Hao Wu, Yutian Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel to capture electromyography signals. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation and enhanced mechanical performance. Hydrogel devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.

Microrobots
In article number 2310084, Salvador Pan&#233;, Minsoo Kim, Hao Ye, and co&#8208;workers introduce microrobotic superstructures comprising a magnetic gelatin composite chassis threaded with iron helical micromachines. Magnetic inputs can be used to navigate the superstructure (gradients) and also dissolve the chassis through magnetic hyperthermia, thereby releasing the micromachines to navigate through narrow channels. The capability of these micromachines to disassemble on&#8208;command to access narrower conduits enhances the microrobots' multifunctionality.

Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been extensively developed as potentially transformative in vitro models to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs. The latest developments toward intelligent organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems where sensing, data processing, and modulating units are integrated and coordinated to fine&#8208;tune the in vitro models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications are reviewed.








Abstract
In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

&lt;p&gt;In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ-on-a-chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro- and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in-depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor-intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed-loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross-disciplinary strategies is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass have great potential for carbon emission reduction. This review covers the fundamental properties of biomass and the hydrothermal environment, the intrinsic mechanisms and regulation methods of biomass hydrothermal carbonization, the wide range of applications of derived carbon materials, and the sustainability potential of carbon materials.








Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.








Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches. Furthermore, new trends and future directions for&#160;as&#160;prevailed commercialization of aerogels as plastic materials are discussed.

         <title>Revitalizing Ancient Mitochondria with Nano&#8208;Strategies: Mitochondria&#8208;Remedying Nanodrugs Concentrate on Disease Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial quality decrease, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and inflammation are the major features of multiple types of diseases of mitochondrial damage. Mitochodnria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs with different characteristics and remarkable brilliance are committed to ameliorating various diseases by rescuing mitochondria via repairing mitochondrial quality, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, inhibiting mPTP and inflammation response and mitochondrial bionics.








Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. This review elucidates the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease are detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions are widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C = C Cross&#8208;linking strategy is an effective tool to improve the chem&#8208;physic, optoelectronic, and soluton&#8208;processing capacities of organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) for optoelectronic applications. This review mainly describes the structural type, characterization method, and unique property of the C = C cross&#8208;linking OCMs system, and further summarizes their application in the field of organic optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consist of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. The cross&#8208;linked strategy provides an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allows for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent physicochemical properties, and substantial improvement in device fabrication. An unsaturated double carbon&#8211;carbon bond (C = C) is universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, the authors will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction are also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and physicochemical property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, and unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach is presented, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, the authors offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via the cross&#8208;linking strategy.

The rational construction and microenvironment regulation of interlayer nanochannels are of vital importance for the realization of efficient ion separation and storage. This review systematically summarizes the interlayer engineering strategies of layered materials and discusses their effects on ion separation and storage, which provide guidance for designing high&#8208;performance separation membranes and battery electrodes.








Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their 2D derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with a focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active organic materials, including electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, are discussed individually. The challenges, solutions, and perspectives are also proposed in this review.








Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is presented. RTP can be achieved by small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystal, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic host and guest, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The constructions, RTP properties, and applications of supramolecular assembly systems are discussed in detail. This review lays the foundation for developing RTP supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission, and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

         <title>Expanding the Horizons of Machine Learning in Nanomaterials to Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyzes machine learning methods for studying achiral nanomaterials and offers guidance for adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials in the context of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented, offering insights on leveraging machine learning for these complex relationships. Key achievements, challenges, and outlook for machine learning in chiral nanomaterials research are discussed.








Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
