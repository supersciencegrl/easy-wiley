         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Challenges and Recent Advances in High Capacity Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical applications of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, are hindered by their inherent shortcomings. In this case, the recent understanding of complex reaction mechanisms, the novel modification methods, and the corresponding development trends are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, other branches and the future opportunities of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&gt;250&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Techniques for Printing of Functional Inks for Flexible Physical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of droplet&#8208;based printing techniques, namely inkjet, aerosol jet, and E&#8208;jet, are reviewed in depth. Furthermore, other important aspects of printed electronics such as functional inks, sintering methods, and flexible substrates are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques, and main challenges toward printed electronics are also reviewed.








Abstract
Printed electronics (PE) is an emerging technology that uses functional inks to print electrical components and circuits on variety of substrates. This technology has opened up new possibilities to fabricate flexible, bendable, and form&#8208;fitting devices at low&#8208;cost and fast speed. There are different printing technologies in use, among which droplet&#8208;based techniques are of great interest as they provide the possibility of printing computer&#8208;controlled design patterns with high resolution, and greater production flexibility. Nanomaterial inks form the heart of this technology, enabling different functionalities. To this end, intensive research has been carried out on formulating inks with conductive, semiconductive, magnetic, piezoresistive, and piezoelectric properties. Here, a detailed landscape view on different droplet&#8208;based printing technologies (inkjet, aerosol jet, and electrohydrodynamic jet) is provided, with comprehensive discussion on their working principals. This is followed by a detailed research overview of different functional inks (metal, carbon, polymer, and ceramic). Different sintering methods and common substrates being used in printed electronics are also discussed, followed by an in&#8208;depth review of different physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques. Finally, the challenges facing the field are considered and a perspective on possible ways to overcome them is provided.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG)&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG&#8208;based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User&#8208;friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self&#8208;care capabilities.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.

         <title>Recent Development of Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers requires a fundamental understanding of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, which is the primary focus of this review. The water electrolyzer in alkaline and acid are compared; and the recent advances in OER mechanisms, the strategies for enhancing activity and stability of electrocatalysts, surface reconstruction, and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one of the most promising hydrogen production techniques. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure&#8211;activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based OER catalysts and the current progress of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted Kinetic Trapping in Quaternary Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kinetic&#8208;trapping method that is compatible with solution&#8208;processing is presented. The method is demonstrated by fabricating an ultraviolet emitting perovskite alloy: Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3. The method involves heating a precursor solution to provide it with sufficient thermal energy to form the alloy state. The method yields a material with superior stability and optical properties compared to simple precursor mixing.








Abstract
Engineering halide perovskites through alloying allows synthesis of materials having tuned electronic and optical properties; however, synthesizing many of these alloys is hindered by the formation of demixed phases arising due to thermodynamically unstable crystal structures. Methods have been developed to make such alloys, such as solid&#8208;phase reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and mechanical grinding; but these are incompatible with low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing and monolithic integration, precluding a number of important applications of these materials. Here, solvent&#8208;phase kinetic trapping (SPKT), an approach that enables the synthesis of novel thermodynamically unfavored perovskite alloys, is developed. SPKT is used to synthesize Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3 and report the first instance of ultraviolet emission in polycrystalline perovskite thin films. SPKT leads to materials exhibiting superior thermal and photostability compared to non&#8208;kinetically trapped materials of the same precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the kinetically trapped material reveals improved optical properties: greater absorption, and longer ground&#8208;state bleach lifetimes. SPKT may be applied to other perovskites to realize improved material properties while benefiting from facile solution&#8208;processing.

         <title>Thermally Stable Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts have attracted extensive interest recently, especially for material synthesis and catalytic performance. Their thermal stability under reaction conditions is closely related to the application of these materials in industry in the future. This Progress Report summarizes recent progress in developing thermally stable single&#8208;atom catalysts, including preparation strategies, coordination structure of single atoms, and catalytic performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in fields related to energy, environment, and material sciences because of the high atom efficiency and the unique properties of these materials. Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis&#8208;involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability. Finally, a perspective of this important and rapidly evolving research field is provided.

         <title>Degradable and Removable Tough Adhesive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water is engineered by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these formulations are tested in accelerated in vitro conditions and to 4 months in vivo. The broad versatility of these adhesives provides the foundation for many in vivo indications.








Abstract
The development of tough adhesive hydrogels has enabled unprecedented adhesion to wet and moving tissue surfaces throughout the body, but they are typically composed of nondegradable components. Here, a family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers is developed. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these new formulations are tested in both accelerated in vitro conditions and up to 16 weeks in vivo. These degradable tough adhesives are engineered with equivalent mechanical and adhesive properties to nondegradable tough adhesives, capable of achieving stretches &gt;20 times their initial length, fracture energies &gt;6&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2,&#160;and&#160;adhesion&#160;energies &gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2.&#160;All degradable systems show complete degradation within 2 weeks under accelerated aging conditions in vitro and weeks to months in vivo depending on the degradable crosslinker selected. Excellent biocompatibility is observed for all groups after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implantation, with minimal fibrous encapsulation and no signs of organ toxicity. On&#8208;demand removal of the adhesive is achieved with treatment of chemical agents which do not cause damage to underlying skin tissue in mice. The broad versatility of this family of adhesives provides the foundation for numerous in vivo indications.

         <title>Target Reprogramming Lysosomes of CD8+ T Cells by a Mineralized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome&#8208;targeted drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (LYS&#8208;NPs) composed of CD63&#8208;aptamers coupled with mineralized metal&#8211;organic frameworks are developed. Using the degradation of the LYS&#8208;NPs in lysosomes, therapeutic proteins and Ca2+ are stored in the lysosomes of T cells. Next, they are released when the T cell receptor (TCR) of the T cells binds to tumor cells. These elements possess a powerful ability for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
T cell immunotherapy holds significant challenges in solid tumors, mainly due to the T cells&#8217; low activation and the decreased synthesis&#8211;release of therapeutic proteins, including perforin and granzyme B, which are present in lysosomes. In this study, a lysosome&#8208;targeting nanoparticle (LYS&#8208;NP) is developed by way of a mineralized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coupled with a lysosome&#8208;targeting aptamer (CD63&#8208;aptamer) to enhance the antitumor effect of T cells. The MOF synthesized from Zn2+ and dimethylimidazole has good protein encapsulation and acid sensitivity, and is thus an ideal lysosomal delivery vector. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is used to induce MOF mineralization, improve the composite material's stability in encapsulating therapeutic protein, and provide calcium ions with synergistic effects. Before mineralization, perforin and granzyme B&#8212;T cell&#8208;needed therapeutic proteins for tumors&#8212;are preloaded with the MOF. Moreover, T cells are pretreated with processed tumor&#8208;specific antigens to activate or produce memory before reprogramming the lysosomes, facilitating the T cell receptor (TCR) for release of the therapeutic proteins. Using T cells recombined by LYS&#8208;NPs, a significant enhancement of breast cancer control is confirmed.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Superhigh Thermoelectric Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Merit in (Mg, Bi) Co&#8208;Doped GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via using the large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) is screened as the effective dopants in GeTe. As a result of the optimized carrier concentration, increased band convergence, and lowered lattice thermal conductivity, Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te shows a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency thermoelectric (TE) technology is determined by the performance of TE materials. Doping is a routine approach in TEs to achieve optimized electrical properties and lowered thermal conductivity. However, how to choose appropriate dopants with desirable solution content to realize high TE figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) is very tough work. In this study, via the use of large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) in GeTe is screened as very effective dopants for potentially high zTs. In experiments, a series of (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doped GeTe compounds are prepared and the electrical and thermal transport properties are systematically investigated. Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, about 0.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 600 K, is obtained in Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te due to the introduced large mass and strain field fluctuations by (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping. In addition, (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping can introduce extra electrons for optimal carrier concentration and diminish the energy offset at the top of the valence band for high density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass. Via these synthetic effects, a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K is achieved for Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te. This study sheds light on the rational design of effective dopants in other TE materials.

         <title>Engineering Band&#8208;Type Alignment in CsPbBr3 Perovskite&#8208;Based Artificial Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering band&#8208;type alignment in CsPbBr3 multiple quantum wells (MQWs) is demonstrated by adapting various organic molecular spacers as quantum barriers. Three different MQWs exhibit a different band offset with CsPbBr3, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, e.g., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures. Photodetectors using these MQWs display distinct carrier dynamics and device characteristics that vary distinctly the barrier material.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterostructures of multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have major applications in optoelectronics. However, for halide perovskites&#8212;the leading class of emerging semiconductors&#8212;building a variety of bandgap alignments (i.e., band&#8208;types) in MQWs is not yet realized owing to the limitations of the current set of used barrier materials. Here, artificial perovskite&#8208;based MQWs using 2,2&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzinetriyl)&#8208;tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;benzimidazole), tris&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, and 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as quantum barrier materials are introduced. The structures of three different five&#8208;stacked perovskite&#8208;based MQWs each exhibiting a different band offset with CsPbBr3 in the conduction and valence bands, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, i.e., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures, are shown. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the disparity in charge carrier dynamics between type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II MQWs. Photodiodes of each type of perovskite artificial MQWs show entirely different carrier behaviors and photoresponse characteristics. Compared with bulk perovskite devices, type&#8208;II MQW photodiodes demonstrate a more than tenfold increase in the rectification ratio. The findings open new opportunities for producing halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based quantum devices by bandgap engineering using simple quantum barrier considerations.

         <title>Recent Progress in Cartilage Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the origins of the outstanding lubricity of healthy articular cartilage is crucial both to potentially treat osteoarthritis symptoms, and for the design of better biomaterials. This progress report reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication, and explores the recent development of natural and of bio&#8208;inspired lubricants.








Abstract
Healthy articular cartilage, covering the ends of bones in major joints such&#160;as hips and knees, presents the most efficiently&#8208;lubricated surface known in nature, with friction coefficients as low as 0.001 up to physiologically high pressures. Such low friction is indeed essential for its well&#8208;being. It minimizes wear&#8208;and&#8208;tear and hence the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, and, by reducing shear stress on the mechanotransductive, cartilage&#8208;embedded chondrocytes (the only cell type in the cartilage), it regulates their function to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the origins of such low friction of the articular cartilage, therefore, is of major importance in order to alleviate disease symptoms, and slow or even reverse its breakdown. This progress report considers the relation between frictional behavior and the cellular mechanical environment in the cartilage, then reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication. Following recent advances based on hydration lubrication, a proposed synergy between different molecular components of the synovial joints, acting together in enabling the low friction, has been proposed. Additionally, recent development of natural and bio&#8208;inspired lubricants is reviewed.

         <title>The Triboelectric Nanogenerator as an Innovative Technology toward Intelligent Sports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress on the development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for the field of intelligent sports is reviewed, highlighting TENG&#8208;based athletic big data, self&#8208;powered smart sports facilities, and wearable equipment. Current challenges and future outlooks regarding this emerging area are also discussed.








Abstract
In the new era of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, athletic big data collection and analysis based on widely distributed sensing networks are particularly important in the development of intelligent sports. Conventional sensors usually require an external power supply, with limitations such as limited lifetime and high maintenance cost. As a newly developed mechanical energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows great potential to overcome these limitations. Most importantly, TENGs can be fabricated using wood, paper, fibers, and polymers, which are the most frequently used materials for sports. Recent progress on the development of TENGs for the field of intelligent sports is summarized. First, the working mechanism of TENG and its association with athletic big data are introduced. Subsequently, the development of TENG&#8208;based sports sensing systems, including smart sports facilities and wearable equipment is highlighted. At last, the remaining challenges and open opportunities are also discussed.

         <title>Weighted Mobility Ratio Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Bi&#8211;Te&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials via Suppression of Minority Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppression of the bipolar conduction in narrow bandgap thermoelectric materials is crucial for improving their device efficiency. This work correlates the weighted mobility ratio in thermoelectric figure of merit and bipolar conduction in bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloys. The results suggest that increasing weighted mobility ratio suppresses the bipolar conduction most effectively among other parameters like carrier concentration and bandgap.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics, which can generate electricity from a temperature difference, or vice versa, is a key technology for solid&#8208;state cooling and energy harvesting; however, its applications are constrained owing to low efficiency. Since the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices is directly obtained via a figure of merit of materials, zT, which is related to the electronic and thermal transport characteristics, the aim here is to elucidate physical parameters that should be considered to understand transport phenomena in semiconducting materials. It is found that the weighted mobility ratio of the majority and minority carrier bands is an important parameter that determines zT. For nanograined Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloy, the unremarked role of this parameter on temperature&#8208;dependent electronic transport properties is demonstrated. This analysis shows that the control of the weighted mobility ratio is a promising way to enhance zT of narrow bandgap thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Van Der Waals Epitaxial Growth and Phase Transition of Layered FeSe2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanocrystals, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, are epitaxially grown on mica by sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. They exhibit metallic behavior with high electrical conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K.








Abstract
Layered iron chalcogenides (FeX, X = S, Se, Te) provide excellent platforms to study intertwined phase transitions, superconductivity, and magnetism. However, layered iron dichalcogenides (FeX2, X = S, Se, Te) are rarely reported and their intrinsic properties are still unknown. Here, phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanocrystals are epitaxially grown on mica by the sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method at atmospheric pressure. The layered atomic structure of FeSe2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Electrical transport shows that the layered FeSe2 is a metal with high conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K. The phase transition manifests itself as a kink in the temperature&#8208;dependent resistivity, as well as anomalous magnetoresistance (MR) appearing around the phase&#8208;transition temperature. The MR changes from negative to positive, accompanied by large hysteresis near the phase&#8208;transition temperature upon cooling. The negative MR and hysteresis might originate from magnetic field suppression scattering of spin fluctuations and competition of magnetic interactions induced by the phase transition, respectively. Layered iron dichalcogenide will be potential candidate to explore novel quantum phenomena and other applications.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electrically Enhanced Intracellular Catalysis of FePt&#8208;FeC Heterostructures for Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a weak alternating magnetic field, the induced charges gathered at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures are demonstrated to promote intracellular catalytic reduction of &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, leading to tumor cell senescence, thereby reducing resistance to treatments such as Fenton reaction&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy. A one&#8211;two punch strategy is proposed and shows good therapeutic effects on tumors.








Abstract
Intracellular catalytic reactions can tailor tumor cell plasticity toward high&#8208;efficiency treatments, but the application is hindered by the low efficiency of intracellular catalysis. Here, a magneto&#8208;electronic approach is developed for efficient intracellular catalysis by inducing eddy currents of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures in mild alternating magnetic fields (frequency of f&#160;= 96&#160;kHz and amplitude of B&#160;&#8804; 70 mT). Finite element simulation shows a high density of induced charges gathering at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructure in the alternating magnetic field. As a result, the concentration of an essential coenzyme&#8212;&#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8212;in cancer cells is significantly reduced by the enhanced catalytic hydrogenation reaction of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures under alternating magnetic stimulation, leading to over 80% of senescent cancer cells&#8212;a vulnerable phenotype that facilitates further treatment. It is further demonstrated that senescent cancer cells can be efficiently killed by the chemodynamic therapy based on the enhanced Fenton&#8208;like reaction. By promoting intracellular catalytic reactions in tumors, this approach may enable precise catalytic tumor treatment.

         <title>Intrinsically Polar Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Assembled Oligopeptide Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, intrinsically polar oligopeptide based piezoelectric force and touch sensors producing large piezoelectric voltage response are presented. They are easily manufactured through solution processing, without the need for electrical poling. The devices exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1 and a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion.








Abstract
Flexible, biocompatible piezoelectric materials are of considerable research interest for a variety of applications, but many suffer from low response or high cost to manufacture. Herein, novel piezoelectric force and touch sensors based on self&#8208;assembled monolayers of oligopeptides are presented, which produce large piezoelectric voltage response and are easily manufactured without the need for electrical poling. While the devices generate modest piezoelectric charge constants (d33) of up to 9.8&#160;pC N&#8722;1, they exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1. Furthermore, a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion. Improvements in peptide selection and device construction promise to further improve the already outstanding voltage response and open the door to numerous practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Targeted Dual Small Interfering Ribonucleic Acid Delivery via Non&#8208;Viral Polymeric Vectors for Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarriers loaded with siRNA enter lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) by targeting the cellular surface receptor Sca1. Successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs is obtained by silencing the RUNX1 and Gli1 genes in an IPF mouse model administered with Fab&#8242; (siRUNX1&#160;+&#160;siGli1)&#8208;loaded micelles.








Abstract
Inhibiting the myofibroblast differentiation of lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) is a promising yet challenging approach for pulmonary fibrosis (PF) therapy. Here, micelles formed by a graft copolymer of multiple PEGs modified branched polyethylenimine are used for delivering runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 (RUNX1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siRUNX1) to the lung, aiming to inhibit the myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs. LR&#8208;MSC targeting is achieved by functionalizing the micelle surface with an anti&#8208;stem&#8208;cell antigen&#8208;1 antibody fragment (Fab&#8242;). Consequently, therapeutic benefits are obtained by successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs in bleomycin&#8208;induced PF model mice treated with siRUNX1&#8208;loaded micelles. Furthermore, an excellent synergistic effect of PF therapy is achieved for this micelle system loaded siRUNX1 and glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1 (Gli1) small interfering RNA (siGli1), a traditional anti&#8208;PF siRNA of glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1. Hence, this work not only provides RUNX1 as a novel PF therapeutic target, but also as a promising dual siRNA&#8208;loaded nanocarrier system for the therapy of PF.

&lt;p&gt;Nanocarriers loaded with siRNA enter lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) by targeting the cellular surface receptor Sca1. Successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs is obtained by silencing the RUNX1 and Gli1 genes in an IPF mouse model administered with Fab&#8242; (siRUNX1&#160;+&#160;siGli1)&#8208;loaded micelles.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibiting the myofibroblast differentiation of lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) is a promising yet challenging approach for pulmonary fibrosis (PF) therapy. Here, micelles formed by a graft copolymer of multiple PEGs modified branched polyethylenimine are used for delivering runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 (RUNX1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siRUNX1) to the lung, aiming to inhibit the myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs. LR&#8208;MSC targeting is achieved by functionalizing the micelle surface with an anti&#8208;stem&#8208;cell antigen&#8208;1 antibody fragment (Fab&#8242;). Consequently, therapeutic benefits are obtained by successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs in bleomycin&#8208;induced PF model mice treated with siRUNX1&#8208;loaded micelles. Furthermore, an excellent synergistic effect of PF therapy is achieved for this micelle system loaded siRUNX1 and glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1 (Gli1) small interfering RNA (siGli1), a traditional anti&#8208;PF siRNA of glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1. Hence, this work not only provides RUNX1 as a novel PF therapeutic target, but also as a promising dual siRNA&#8208;loaded nanocarrier system for the therapy of PF.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reprogramming the Tumor Microenvironment through Second&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Window Photothermal Genome Editing of PD&#8208;L1 Mediated by Supramolecular Gold Nanorods for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal genome&#8208;editing strategy mediated by supramolecular gold nanorods is demonstrated to be effective for the disruption of PD&#8208;L1 of tumor cells, which can simultaneously induce the activation of T cells through immunogenic cell death. Therefore, the genomic disruption of PD&#8208;L1 greatly enables activated T cells to recognize and attack tumor cells under the reprogrammed immunoactive tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
A photothermal genome&#8208;editing strategy is described to improve immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy by CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated disruption of PD&#8208;L1 and mild&#8208;hyperthermia&#8208;induced activation of immunogenic cell death (ICD). This strategy relies on a supramolecular cationic gold nanorod that not only serves as a carrier to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 targeting PD&#8208;L1, but also harvests the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) light and converts into mild hyperthermia to induce both ICD and gene expression of Cas9. The genomic disruption of PD&#8208;L1 significantly augments ICB therapy by improving the conversion of dendritic cells to T cells, followed by promoting the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes into tumors, thereby reprogramming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into immunoactive one. Such a therapeutic modality greatly inhibits the activity of primary and metastatic tumors and exhibits long&#8208;term immune memory effects against both rechallenged and recurrent tumors. The current therapeutic strategy for synergistic PD&#8208;L1 disruption and ICD activation represents an appealing way for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Superstructure of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanoporous Carbon Implanted with Ultrafine Ru Nanoclusters for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered macroporous superstructure of nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoporous carbon implanted with ultrafine Ru nanoclusters is developed via thermal pyrolysis of the ordered macroporous single crystals of ZIF&#8208;8 accommodating Ru(III) ions, which affords unparalleled performance for the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction, with order of magnitude higher mass activity compared to the benchmark Pt/C.








Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an attractive technology for the mass production of hydrogen. Ru&#8208;based materials are promising electrocatalysts owing to the similar bonding strength with hydrogen but much lower cost than Pt catalysts. Herein, an ordered macroporous superstructure of N&#8208;doped nanoporous carbon anchored with the ultrafine Ru nanoclusters as electrocatalytic micro/nanoreactors is developed via the thermal pyrolysis of ordered macroporous single crystals of ZIF&#8208;8 accommodating Ru(III) ions. Benefiting from the highly interconnected reticular macro&#8211;nanospaces, this superstrucure affords unparalleled performance for pH&#8208;universal HER, with order of magnitude higher mass activity compared to the benchmark Pt/C. Notably, an exceptionally low overpotential of only 13 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is required for HER in alkaline solution, with a low Tafel slope of 40.41&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and an ultrahigh turnover frequency value of 1.6 H2 s&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mV, greatly outperforming Pt/C. Furthermore, the hydrogen generation rates are almost twice those of Pt/C during practical overall alkaline water splitting. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen system is also demonstrated to further promote the application. This research may open a new avenue for the development of advanced electrocatalytic micro/nanoreactors with controlled morphology and excellent performance for future energy applications.

         <title>Capturing Mobile Lithium Ions in a Molecular Hole Transporter Enhances the Thermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>

A thermally stable perovskite solar cell is developed by capturing mobile lithium ions using a new molecular hole transporter, 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38), where a strong interaction of the lithium ions in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide with the 5&#8208;octylthieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (octyl&#8208;TPD) moiety in HL38 is responsible for maintaining &#8776;86% of the initial power conversion efficiency for over 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
A thermally stable perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a new molecular hole transporter (MHT) of 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38) is reported. Hole mobility of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and glass transition temperature of 92.2 &#176;C are determined for the HL38 doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine as additives. Interface engineering with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)thiophene hydroiodide (2&#8208;TEAI) between the perovskite and the HL38 improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.60% (untreated) to 21.98%, and this champion PCE is even higher than that of the additive&#8208;containing 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;MeOTAD)&#8208;based device (21.15%). Thermal stability testing at 85 &#176;C for over 1000 h shows that the HL38&#8208;based PSC retains 85.9% of the initial PCE, while the spiro&#8208;MeOTAD&#8208;based PSC degrades unrecoverably from 21.1% to 5.8%. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry studies combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal that HL38 shows lower lithium ion diffusivity than spiro&#8208;MeOTAD due to a strong complexation of the Li+ with HL38, which is responsible for the higher degree of thermal stability. This work delivers an important message that capturing mobile Li+ in a hole&#8208;transporting layer is critical in designing novel MHTs for improving the thermal stability of PSCs. In addition, it also highlights the impact of interface design on non&#8208;conventional MHTs.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Ternary Organic Photovoltaics with Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing method and a ternary strategy, 18.16% efficiency, which is among the highest values reported to date, is achieved in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on the PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;S2 blend, superior to that (18.03%) of bulk&#8208;heterojunction OPVs, proving that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed ternary OPVs could be a promising approach to high efficiencies.








Abstract
Obtaining a finely tuned morphology of the active layer to facilitate both charge generation and charge extraction has long been the goal in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, a solution to resolve the above challenge via synergistically combining the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) procedure and the ternary strategy is proposed and demonstrated. By adding an asymmetric electron acceptor, BTP&#8208;S2, with lower miscibility to the binary donor:acceptor host of PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl, vertical phase distribution can be formed with donor&#8208;enrichment at the anode and acceptor&#8208;enrichment at the cathode in OPV devices during the LbL processing. In contrast, LbL&#8208;type binary OPVs based on PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl still show bulk&#8208;heterojunction like morphology. The formation of the vertical phase distribution can not only reduce charge recombination but also promote charge collection, thus enhancing the photocurrent and fill factor in LbL&#8208;type ternary OPVs. Consequently, LbL&#8208;type ternary OPVs exhibit the best efficiency of 18.16% (certified: 17.8%), which is among the highest values reported to date for OPVs. The work provides a facile and effective approach for achieving high&#8208;efficiency OPVs with expected morphologies, and demonstrates the LbL&#8208;type ternary strategy as being a promising procedure in fabricating OPV devices from the present laboratory study to future industrial production.

         <title>Chlorinated Spiroconjugated Fused Extended Aromatics for Multifunctional Organic Electronics</title>

         <dc:description>
A new molecule, SFIC&#8208;Cl, featured by enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization by fused&#8208;spiroconjugation and narrowed bandgap by chlorination, is constructed, and is integrated into single&#8208;crystal transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and organic photovoltaics. This study demonstrates that these chlorinated spiroconjugated fused systems offer a novel direction toward development of high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for hybrid organic electronic devices.








Abstract
The synthesis of a new molecule, SFIC&#8208;Cl, is reported, which features enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization by spiroconjugation and narrowed bandgap by chlorination. SFIC&#8208;Cl is integrated into a single&#8208;crystal transistor (OFET) and organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED). The material demonstrates remarkable transport abilities across various solution&#8208;processed OFETs and retains efficient radiance in a near&#8208;infrared OLED emitting light at 700&#160;nm. Furthermore, the intermolecular multi&#8208;dimensional connection of SFIC&#8208;Cl enables the fabrication of a single&#8208;component large&#8208;area (2 &#215; 2&#160;cm2) near&#8208;infrared OLED by spin&#8208;coating. The SFIC&#8208;Cl&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based solar cell shows excellent power conversion efficiency of 10.16% resulting from the broadened and strong absorption and well&#8208;matched energy levels. The study demonstrates that chlorinated spiroconjugated fused systems offer a novel direction toward the development of high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for hybrid organic electronic devices.

         <title>Efficient Reversible Conversion between MoS2 and Mo/Na2S Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Supported Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst of iron single atoms on a nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SAFe@NG) substrate is selected to catalyze reversible conversion in MoS2 anodes. Importantly, the SAFe@NG catalyst with highly active Fe&#8211;N4 sites significantly facilitates the conversion of Mo/Na2S to MoS2 in the charging processes, resulting in an efficient reversible conversion reaction of MoS2&#8596;NaMoS2&#8596;Mo/Na2S in a complete cycle, which is demonstrated by spectroscopy, microscopy, and simulations.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion&#8208;type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S&#8594;NaMoS2&#8594;MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe&#8211;N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2&#8596;NaMoS2&#8596;Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst. This work contributes new avenues for designing conversion&#8208;type materials with an efficient reversible mechanism.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Threshold Continuous&#8208;Wave Room&#8208;Temperature Crystal&#8208;Fiber/Nanoperovskite Hybrid Lasers for All&#8208;Optical Photonic Integration</title>

         <dc:description>
Purcell&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter coupling between an atomically smooth fiber microcavity and perovskite gain nanocrystallites enables a high Q (&#8776;1500) and a high &#946; (0.31), outperforming previously reported structures with a 132 nW record&#8208;low threshold. This is thought to be the first demonstration of monolithic integration of a perovskite laser into a compact and inexpensive fiber platform.








Abstract
Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) room&#8208;temperature (RT) laser operation with low energy consumption is an ultimate goal for electrically driven lasers. A monolithically integrated perovskite laser in a chip&#8208;level fiber scheme is ideal. However, because of the well&#8208;recognized air and thermal instabilities of perovskites, laser action in a perovskite has mostly been limited to either pulsed or cryogenic&#8208;temperature operations. Most CW laser operations at RT have had poor durability. Here, crystal fibers that have robust and high&#8208;heat&#8208;load nature are shown to be the key to enabling the first demonstration of ultralow&#8208;threshold CW RT laser action in a compact, monolithic, and inexpensive crystal fiber/nanoperovskite hybrid architecture that is directly pumped with a 405 nm diode laser. Purcell&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter coupling between the atomically smooth fiber microcavity and the perovskite nanocrystallites gain medium enables a high Q (&#8776;1500) and a high &#946; (0.31). This 762 nm laser outperforms previously reported structures with a record&#8208;low threshold of 132&#160;nW and an optical&#8208;to&#8208;optical slope conversion efficiency of 2.93%, and it delivers a stable output for CW and RT operation. These results represent a significant advancement toward monolithic all&#8208;optical integration.

         <title>Printable and Stretchable Giant Magnetoresistive Sensors for Highly Compliant and Skin&#8208;Conformal Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly compliant and printable giant magnetoresistive sensors reveal skin&#8208;conformability and excellent sensitivity to small magnetic fields because of highly sensitive giant magnetoresistive multilayers bound with sticky triblock copolymer, which is capable of on&#8208;skin interactive electronics for a touchless control of virtual objects.








Abstract
Highly compliant electronics, naturally conforming to human skin, represent a paradigm shift in the interplay with the surroundings. Solution&#8208;processable printing technologies are yet to be developed to comply with requirements to mechanical conformability of on&#8208;skin appliances. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;performance spintronic elements can be printed on ultrathin 3 &#181;m thick polymeric foils enabling the mechanically imperceptible printed magnetoelectronics, which can adapt to the periodic buckling surface to be biaxially stretched over 100%. They constitute the first example of printed and stretchable giant magnetoresistive sensors, revealing 2 orders of magnitude improvements in mechanical stability and sensitivity at small magnetic fields, compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed magnetoelectronics. The key enabler of this performance enhancement is the use of elastomeric triblock copolymers as a binder for the magnetosensitive paste. Even when bent to a radius of 16&#160;&#181;m, the sensors printed on ultrathin foils remain intact and possess unmatched sensitivity for printed magnetoelectronics of 3&#160;T&#8208;1 in a low magnetic field of 0.88 mT. The compliant printed sensors can be used as components of on&#8208;skin interactive electronics as it is demonstrated with a touchless control of virtual objects including zooming in and out of interactive maps and scrolling through electronic documents.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Spin Torques on Single GdFeCo Magnetic Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is proposed for spintronics. GdFeCo/Cu bilayers are found to be 20 times more efficient than Pt layers to generate spin currents from charge currents. It is also shown that these spin currents create strong &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on GdFeCo without the need of heavy metal. This work opens up another way to control the magnetic state of devices.








Abstract
Spintronics exploit spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) to generate spin currents, spin torques, and, in the absence of inversion symmetry, Rashba and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The widely used magnetic materials, based on 3d metals such as Fe and Co, possess a small SOC. To circumvent this shortcoming, the common practice has been to utilize the large SOC of nonmagnetic layers of 5d heavy metals (HMs), such as Pt, to generate spin currents and, in turn, exert spin torques on the magnetic layers. Here, a new class of material architectures is introduced, excluding nonmagnetic 5d HMs, for high&#8208;performance spintronics operations. Very strong current&#8208;induced torques exerted on single ferrimagnetic GdFeCo layers, due to the combination of large SOC of the Gd 5d states and inversion symmetry breaking mainly engineered by interfaces, are demonstrated. These &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; are enhanced around the magnetization compensation temperature and can be tuned by adjusting the spin absorption outside the GdFeCo layer. In other measurements, the very large emission of spin current from GdFeCo, 80% (20%) of spin anomalous Hall effect (spin Hall effect) symmetry is determined. This material platform opens new perspectives to exert &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on single magnetic layers as well as to generate spin currents from a magnetic layer.

         <title>Unveiling the Local Atomic Arrangements in the Shear Band Regions of Metallic Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct mapping of local atomic bonding and packing in deformed metallic glass is reported, with identification of the structural/chemical variation in and across the shear bands, forming the shear&#8208;affected zones. The results confirm theoretical predictions for local softening in the deformed areas and provide necessary information to further engineer the catastrophic deformation failure of metallic glasses.








Abstract
The prospective applications of metallic glasses are limited by their lack of ductility, attributed to shear banding inducing catastrophic failure. A concise depiction of the local atomic arrangement (local atomic packing and chemical short&#8208;range order), induced by shear banding, is quintessential to understand the deformation mechanism, however still not clear. An explicit view of the complex interplay of local atomic structure and chemical environment is presented by mapping the atomic arrangements in shear bands (SBs) and in their vicinity in a deformed Vitreloy 105 metallic glass, using the scanning electron diffraction pair distribution function and atom probe tomography. The results experimentally prove that plastic deformation causes a reduction of geometrically favored polyhedral motifs. Localized motifs variations and antisymmetric (bond and chemical) segregation extend for several hundred nanometers from the SB, forming the shear band affected zones. Moreover, the variations within the SB are found both perpendicular and parallel to the SB plane, also observable in the oxidation activity. The knowledge of the structural&#8211;chemical changes provides a deeper understanding of the plastic deformation of metallic glasses especially for their functional applications and future improvements.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries: Quantifying Hydrogen Evolution and a Solid&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>

The hydrogen evolution in a Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. Meanwhile, a highly electronically insulating but highly Zn2+ ion conductive ZnF2 solid ion conductor is utilized to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction during cycling but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution in Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. The hydrogen fluxes reach 3.76 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell in each segment, and 7.70 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//MnO2 full cell. Then, a highly electronically insulating (0.11 mS cm&#8722;1) but highly Zn2+ ion conductive (80.2 mS cm&#8722;1) ZnF2 solid ion conductor with high Zn2+ transfer number (0.65) is constructed to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition. Precisely quantitated, the Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 cell only produces 0.02 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 of hydrogen (0.53% of the Zn//Zn cell). Encouragingly, a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) full cell only produces maximum hydrogen flux of 0.06 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (0.78% of the Zn//Zn cell) at the fully charging state. Meanwhile, Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 symmetric cell exhibits excellent stability under ultrahigh current density and areal capacity (10 mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2) over 590 h (285 cycles), which far outperforms all reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. In light of the superior Zn@ZnF2 anode, the high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 batteries (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) shows remarkable cycling stability over 1000 cycles with 93.63% capacity retained at &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency.

         <title>Polycationic Polymer Layer for Air&#8208;Stable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Metal Anodes in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycationic and hydrophobic polymer protective layer of Li metal is developed by a scalable tape&#8208;casting method. Steady Li plating/stripping in commercial carbonate electrolyte can be achieved under a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 with Li utilization efficiency up to 51.6%. The modified Li also shows unaffected performance after exposure to ambient air or contact with water.








Abstract
The short cycle life and safety concerns caused by uncontrollable dendrite growth have severely hindered the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, a polycationic and hydrophobic polymer protective layer fabricated by a scalable tape&#8208;casting method is developed to enable air&#8208;stable, dendrite&#8208;free, and highly efficient Li metal anodes. The polymeric cations of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium) (PDDA) provide an electrostatic shielding effect that unifies Li+ flux at the surface of the Li anode and promotes a homogeneous Li plating, while the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anions bring hydrophobic characteristics and improve moisture stability. The accumulated TFSI anions by the polycationic film also facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Steady Li plating/stripping in the carbonate electrolyte can be achieved under a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 700 h with Li utilization efficiency up to 51.6%. LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiFePO4 cells using the modified anode exhibit much improved electrochemical performance compared with the bare Li counterpart. Moreover, ultrasonic imaging shows no gas generation in the modified Li/LiFePO4 pouch cell. Mechanism investigation demonstrates the stable SEI and homogeneous Li deposition derived by the polycationic layer.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Like Heterostructures of MoS2/Graphene with Enlarged Interlayer Spacing and Enhanced Hydrophilicity as High&#8208;Performance Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sandwich&#8208;like heterostructure of intercalating graphene into a MoS2 gallery significantly enlarges the MoS2 interlayer spacing from 0.62 to 1.16&#160;nm and simultaneously enhances the hydrophilicity. These structural merits enable facilitated Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and a highly reversible phase transition between 2H&#8208; and 1T&#8208;MoS2 upon Zn2+ insertion/extraction, thus rendering a splendid high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Layered materials have great potential as cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their facile 2D Zn2+ transport channels; however, either low capacity or poor cycling stability limits their practical applications. Herein, two classical layered materials are innovatively combined by intercalating graphene into MoS2 gallery, which results in significantly enlarged MoS2 interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.16&#160;nm) and enhanced hydrophilicity. The sandwich&#8208;structured MoS2/graphene nanosheets self&#8208;assemble into a flower&#8208;like architecture that facilitates Zn&#8208;ion diffusion, promotes electrolyte infiltration, and ensures high structural stability. Therefore, this novel MoS2/graphene nanocomposite exhibits exceptional high&#8208;rate capability (285.4&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 with 141.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (88.2% capacity retention after 1800 cycles). The superior Zn2+ migration kinetics and desirable pseudocapacitive behaviors are confirmed by electrochemical measurements and density functional theory computations. The energy storage mechanism regarding the highly reversible phase transition between 2H&#8208; and 1T&#8208;MoS2 upon Zn&#8208;ion insertion/extraction is elucidated through ex situ investigations. As a proof of concept, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion battery employing the MoS2/graphene cathode demonstrates great stability under different bending conditions. This study paves a new direction for the design and on&#8208;going development of 2D materials as high&#8208;performance cathodes for AZIBs.

         <title>Operando Magnetometry Probing the Charge Storage Mechanism of CoO Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge storage mechanisms in CoO lithium&#8208;ion batteries are demonstrated, based on the interpretation of the results of operando magnetometry. They involve the well&#8208;known conversion reactions, the formation of a spin capacitor, and the growth of polymeric films. More importantly, direct evidence strongly supporting the catalytic role of metallic Co in assisting the polymeric film formation is obtained.








Abstract
Cobalt oxide (CoO) is a promising electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), where the charge storage is believed to take place solely during the electrochemical oxidation/reduction processes. However, this simple picture has been increasingly challenged by reported anomalously large storage capacities, indicating the existence of undiscovered extra charge reservoirs inside the system. Here, an advanced operando magnetometry technology is employed to monitor the magnetization variation of the CoO LIBs in real time and, in this particular system, it is clearly demonstrated that the anomalous capacity is associated with both the reversible formation of a spin capacitor and the growth of a polymeric film at low voltages. Furthermore, operando magnetometry provides direct evidence of the catalytic role of metallic Co in assisting the polymeric film formation. These critical findings help pave the way for better understanding of the charge storage mechanisms of transition&#8208;metal oxides and further utilizing them to design novel electrode materials.

         <title>N&#233;el&#8208;Type Elliptical Skyrmions in a Laterally Asymmetric Magnetic Multilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type elliptical magnetic skyrmions are observed in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers with an oblique&#8208;angle deposited Co layer. The formation of elliptical skyrmions is found to be related to the anisotropic effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction in the film plane. The results provide a route to tuning the symmetry of skyrmions for related physics study and device applications.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, topological&#8208;chiral spin textures, have potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices for information storage and logic technologies. Tailoring the detailed spin textures of skyrmions is of pivotal importance for tuning skyrmion dynamics, which is one of the key factors for the design of skyrmionic devices. Here, the direct observation of parallel aligned elliptical magnetic skyrmions in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers with an oblique&#8208;angle deposited Co layer is reported. Domain wall velocity and spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective field analysis demonstrate that the formation of unusual elliptical skyrmions is correlated to the anisotropic effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density (Keffu) and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in the film plane. Structural analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations further show that the anisotropic Keffu and DMI originate from the interfacial anisotropic strain introduced by the oblique&#8208;angle deposition. The work provides a method to tune the spin textures of skyrmions in magnetic multilayers and, thereby, a new degree of freedom for the design of skyrmionic devices.

         <title>Formation of Highly Doped Nanostripes in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides via a Dislocation Climb Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to dope transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) is demonstrated in which a high density (6.4&#8211;15%) of dopants is confined within 1D nanostripes embedded in the TMDC lattice. The growth of the nanostripe structures originates from the migration of dislocation cores and is also the key to introduce dopants into 2D materials.








Abstract
Doping of materials beyond the dopant solubility limit remains a challenge, especially when spatially nonuniform doping is required. In 2D materials with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, various post&#8208;synthesis approaches to doping have been demonstrated, but full control over spatial distribution of dopants remains a challenge. A post&#8208;growth doping of single layers of WSe2 is performed by adding transition metal (TM) atoms in a two&#8208;step process, which includes annealing followed by deposition of dopants together with Se or S. The Ti, V, Cr, and Fe impurities at W sites are identified by using transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Remarkably, an extremely high density (6.4&#8211;15%) of various types of impurity atoms is achieved. The dopants are revealed to be largely confined within nanostripes embedded in the otherwise pristine WSe2. Density functional theory calculations show that the dislocations assist the incorporation of the dopant during their climb and give rise to stripes of TM dopant atoms. This work demonstrates a possible spatially controllable doping strategy to achieve the desired local electronic, magnetic, and optical properties in 2D materials.

         <title>Macrocyclic&#8208;Amphiphile&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles for Ratiometric Delivery of Therapeutic Combinations to Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic&#8208;amphiphile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle (MASN) with the capability of precise loading and ratiometric delivery of different drugs is developed for effective combination chemotherapy. The MASN can quickly convert the optimal drug ratio of a therapeutic combination identified in vitro into therapeutic benefits in vivo, providing a potential platform for the rapid development of effective combinations of cancer therapies.








Abstract
Combination chemotherapy refers to the use of multiple drugs to treat cancer. In this therapy, the optimal ratio of the drugs is essential to achieve drug synergism and the desired therapeutic effects. However, most delivery strategies are unable to precisely control the ratio of the drugs during the drug loading and delivery processes, resulting in inefficient synergy and unpredictable efficacy. Herein, a macrocyclic&#8208;amphiphile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle (MASN) that achieves precise loading and ratiometric delivery of therapeutic combinations is presented. By integrating multiple macrocyclic cavities within a single nanoparticle, the MASN can load multiple drug molecules via the host&#8211;guest interaction, and the ratio of the drugs loaded can be predicted with their initial concentrations and characteristic binding affinity. Moreover, MASNs are readily degraded under a hypoxic microenvironment, allowing spontaneous release of the drugs upon reaching tumor tissues. With precise drug loading and controlled release mechanisms, MASNs achieve ratiometric delivery of multiple commercial drugs to tumors, thereby achieving optimal anti&#8208;tumor effects. Since the optimal drug ratio of a therapeutic combination can be quickly determined in vitro, MASNs can translate this optimal ratio to the therapeutic benefits in vivo, providing a potential platform for the rapid development of effective combination cancer therapies involving multiple drugs.

In article number 2006003, Yuan Ping and co&#8208;workers, by means of photothermal transcription of CRISPR/Cas9 in the second near&#8208;infrared window, demonstrate genome editing of PD&#8208;L1 to be effective to reprogram the tumor microenvironment. The photothermal genome editing for the disruption of PD&#8208;L1 mediated by supramolecular gold nanorods also simultaneously activates T cells to infiltrate and attack tumor cells in the deep tissues, which can substantially improve cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Operando Magnetometry Probing the Charge Storage Mechanism of CoO Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries (Adv. Mater. 12/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006629, Hongsen Li, Yunze Long, Qiang Li, and co&#8208;workers use an advanced operando magnetometry technique to probe the charge&#8208;storage mechanism of CoO lithium&#8208;ion batteries, showing that the anomalous discharge capacity in this particular system is associated with both the reversible formation of a spin capacitor and the growth of a polymeric film at low voltages. The key catalytic role of metallic Co in assisting the polymeric film formation is demonstrated, which is helpful for the design of new types of energy&#8208;storage devices and improving the energy density for future battery designs.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2006819, Chien&#8208;Chih Lai and co&#8208;workers report the first demonstration of a diode&#8208;pumped ultralow&#8208;threshold continuous&#8208;wave room&#8208;temperature perovskite laser, by coating MAPbI3 nanocrystallites onto a high&#8208;quality yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystal fiber. The atomically smooth crystal fiber not only serves as a perfect microcavity for ultralow&#8208;loss optical resonance but also facilitates heat dissipation toward robust laser devices, outperforming previously reported structures. This readies the ground for electrically driven lasers for all&#8208;optical photonic integration.

A chemical model capable of predicting the operational stability for organic light&#8208;emitting devices is established, as reported by Dongho Kim, Jun Yeob Lee, Youngmin You, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2003832. This model involves Langevin recombination, followed by electron transfer from a dopant to a host exciton, as the key degradation step. The research disentangles the chemical processes in the degradation and provides a useful foundation for enhancing the operational stability of electroluminescence devices.

         <title>Emerging Opportunities for 2D Semiconductor/Ferroelectric Transistor&#8208;Structure Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between 2D semiconductors and ferroelectrics results in new functionalities, which could be expected to deliver massively enhanced device performance for existing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies and add unprecedented applications for next&#8208;generation electronics. Recent progress in using 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric hybrid structures to enable a rich variety of emerging device concepts is critically reviewed.








Abstract
Semiconductor technology, which is rapidly evolving, is poised to enter a new era for which revolutionary innovations are needed to address fundamental limitations on material and working principle level. 2D semiconductors inherently holding novel properties at the atomic limit show great promise to tackle challenges imposed by traditional bulk semiconductor materials. Synergistic combination of 2D semiconductors with functional ferroelectrics further offers new working principles, and is expected to deliver massively enhanced device performance for existing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies and add unprecedented applications for next&#8208;generation electronics. Herein, recent demonstrations of novel device concepts based on 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric heterostructures are critically reviewed covering their working mechanisms, device construction, applications, and challenges. In particular, emerging opportunities of CMOS&#8208;process&#8208;compatible 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric transistor structure devices for the development of a rich variety of applications are discussed, including beyond&#8208;Boltzmann transistors, nonvolatile memories, neuromorphic devices, and reconfigurable nanodevices such as p&#8211;n homojunctions and self&#8208;powered photodetectors. It is concluded that 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric heterostructures, as an emergent heterogeneous platform, could drive many more exciting innovations for modern electronics, beyond the capability of ubiquitous silicon systems.

         <title>Emerging Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled/Enhanced Nanodynamic Therapies beyond Traditional Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical roles, functions, and biological effects of nanomedicines and nanosensitizers (e.g., sonosensitizing, photothermal&#8208;converting, electronic, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, radiation&#8208;sensitizing, and catalytic properties) for enabling the disease&#8208;specific therapeutic procedure of nanodynamic therapies (NDTs) are highlighted and discussed, along with the underlying therapeutic principle and optimization strategy for augmenting disease&#8208;therapeutic efficacy and biosafety.








Abstract
The rapid knowledge growth of nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology enables and promotes the emergence of distinctive disease&#8208;specific therapeutic modalities, among which nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented nanodynamic therapy (NDT), as triggered by either exogenous or endogenous activators on nanosensitizers, can generate reactive radicals for accomplishing efficient disease nanotherapies with mitigated side effects and endowed disease specificity. As one of the most representative modalities of NDT, traditional light&#8208;activated photodynamics suffers from the critical and unsurmountable issues of the low tissue&#8208;penetration depth of light and the phototoxicity of the photosensitizers. To overcome these obstacles, versatile nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented NDTs have been explored for satisfying varied biomedical applications, which strongly depend on the physicochemical properties of the involved nanomedicines and nanosensitizers. These distinctive NDTs refer to sonodynamic therapy (SDT), thermodynamic therapy (TDT), electrodynamic therapy (EDT), piezoelectric dynamic therapy (PZDT), pyroelectric dynamic therapy (PEDT), radiodynamic therapy (RDT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, the critical roles, functions, and biological effects of nanomedicine (e.g., sonosensitizing, photothermal&#8208;converting, electronic, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, radiation&#8208;sensitizing, and catalytic properties) for enabling the therapeutic procedure of NDTs, are highlighted and discussed, along with the underlying therapeutic principle and optimization strategy for augmenting disease&#8208;therapeutic efficacy and biosafety. The present challenges and critical issues on the clinical translations of NDTs are also discussed and clarified.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Modulation of Macrophage Fate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulatory materials with tailored physical, chemical, biological, and dynamic properties can modulate the immune responses of macrophages for the desired activation and polarization of antiinflammatory or proinflammatory phenotypes, which thus enable a wide range of promising immunoengineering applications, such as cancer therapy, infection treatment, inflammation resolution, tissue regeneration, and vaccination.








Abstract
Human immune system acts as a pivotal role in the tissue homeostasis and disease progression. Immunomodulatory biomaterials that can manipulate innate immunity and adaptive immunity hold great promise for a broad range of prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. This review is focused on the design strategies and principles of immunomodulatory biomaterials from the standpoint of materials science to regulate macrophage fate, such as activation, polarization, adhesion, migration, proliferation, and secretion. It offers a comprehensive survey and discussion on the tunability of material designs regarding physical, chemical, biological, and dynamic cues for modulating macrophage immune response. The range of such tailorable cues encompasses surface properties, surface topography, materials mechanics, materials composition, and materials dynamics. The representative immunoengineering applications selected herein demonstrate how macrophage&#8208;immunomodulating biomaterials are being exploited for cancer immunotherapy, infection immunotherapy, tissue regeneration, inflammation resolution, and vaccination. A perspective on the future research directions of immunoregulatory biomaterials is also provided.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Halide Perovskites for Polarized Luminescence and Detection: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments and advanced understanding of polarization&#8208;sensitive halide perovskites are comprehensively reviewed, involving linear/circular polarization luminescence and detection. Also, the key challenges and current opportunities in the field are discussed. The great promise of polarization&#8208;sensitive halide perovskites is addressed to inspire other potential applications in opotoelectronics.








Abstract
While halide perovskites (HPs) have achieved enormous success in the field of optoelectronic applications, much attention has been recently drawn to the unique polarization sensitivity of HPs, either intrinsic or extrinsic, which makes HPs a potential candidate for innovative applications in directly polarized luminescence and detection. Herein, the research status in the field of polarization&#8208;sensitive HPs, including linear polarization and circular polarization, is comprehensively summarized. To evaluate the effectiveness of HPs in generating and detecting linearly or circularly polarized light, the principles and characterization methods of polarized luminescence and detection are introduced. Sequentially, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development of the strategies that induce the linear or circular polarization characteristics of HPs is systematically reviewed, based on which the application of polarization&#8208;sensitive HPs in the field of polarization luminescence and detection are summarized. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities are discussed, and prospects of the future development in this promising field are outlined.

         <title>Recent Advances in Functional Materials through Cellulose Nanofiber Templating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber templating is a promising approach to obtain advanced functional materials. The unique attributes of cellulose nanofibers can be exploited to impart distinct properties onto the final templated materials. Two major considerations of cellulose nanofiber templating are reviewed: the detailed mechanisms and methodologies used to produce the materials and the specific applications that utilize this templating strategy.








Abstract
Advanced templating techniques have enabled delicate control of both nano&#8208; and microscale structures and have helped thrust functional materials into the forefront of society. Cellulose nanomaterials are derived from natural polymers and show promise as a templating source for advanced materials. Use of cellulose nanomaterials in templating combines nanoscale property control with sustainability, an attribute often lacking in other templating techniques. Use of cellulose nanofibers for templating has shown great promise in recent years, but previous reviews on cellulose nanomaterial templating techniques have not provided extensive analysis of cellulose nanofiber templating. Cellulose nanofibers display several unique properties, including mechanical strength, porosity, high water retention, high surface functionality, and an entangled fibrous network, all of which can dictate distinctive aspects in the final templated materials. Many applications exploit the unique aspects of templating with cellulose nanofibers that help control the final properties of the material, including, but not limited to, applications in catalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, electrodes, building materials, biomaterials, and membranes. A detailed analysis on the use of cellulose nanofibers templating is provided, addressing specifically how careful selection of templating mechanisms and methodologies, combined toward goal applications, can be used to directly benefit chosen applications in advanced functional materials.

         <title>Quantitative Prediction of the Electro&#8208;Mechanical Response in Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that it is possible to fully rationalize the relation between mechanical deformation and electronic properties of organic molecular semiconductors through a suitable and accessible theory, achieving quantitative agreement with experiments across orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude differences. The protocol provides the tools to identify rapidly new compounds sensitive/insensitive to mechanical deformation for advanced applications such as flexible and wearable devices, like e&#8208;skins.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors&#8217; inherent flexibility makes them appealing for advanced applications such as wearable electronics, e&#8208;skins, or pressure sensors, and can even be used to enhance their intrinsic electronic properties. Unfortunately, these applications for organic materials are currently hindered by the lack of a quantitative understanding of the interplay between their electrical and mechanical properties. In this work, this gap is filled by presenting an accurate methodology able to predict quantitatively the effects of external deformation on the charge transport properties of any organic semiconductors. Three prototypical materials are investigated, showing that the experimental variation of charge carrier mobility with strain is fully reproduced, even in a wide range of deformations applied along different crystal axes. The results indicate that the intrinsic electro&#8208;mechanical response of the materials varies by orders of magnitude within the class of organic semiconductors, a difference rationalized observing that the mobility trend is primarily influenced by the transfer integrals&#8217; variation, rather than by a modification of the crystal phonons. In light of its robustness, accuracy, and low computational cost, this protocol represents an ideal tool to quantify the electro&#8208;mechanical response in new organic compounds, thus establishing a reliable route for a full exploitation of strain engineering in advanced&#160;technologies.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Gradient Ionogels for Highly Sensitive, Broad&#8208;Range&#8208;Response, and Freeze/Heat&#8208;Resistant Ionic Fingers</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by gradient modulus distribution of human fingers, gradient ionogels are prepared by an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced cationic crosslinkers migration strategy. The gradient of the modulus distribution enables the gradient&#8208;ionogel&#8208;based flexible sensors to demonstrate high sensitivity and broader&#8208;range detection simultaneously. Moreover, the flexible iontronic sensors also show good longtime stability and excellent performance over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Human fingers exhibit both high sensitivity and wide tactile range. The finger skin structures are designed to display gradient microstructures and compressibility. Inspired by the gradient mechanical Young's modulus distribution, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced cationic crosslinker migration strategy is demonstrated to prepare gradient ionogels. Due to the gradient of the crosslinkers, the ionogels exhibit more than four orders of magnitude difference between the anode and the cathode side, enabling gradient ionogel&#8208;based flexible iontronic sensors having high&#8208;sensitivity and broader&#8208;range detection (from 3 &#215; 102 to 2.5 &#215; 106&#160;Pa) simultaneously. Moreover, owing to the remarkable properties of the gradient ionogels, the flexible iontronic sensors also show good long&#8208;time stability (even after 10 000 cycles loadings) and excellent performance over a wide temperature range (from &#8722;108 to 300 &#176;C). The flexible iontronic sensors are further integrated on soft grips, exhibiting remarkable performance under various conditions. These attractive features demonstrate that gradient ionogels will be promising candidates for smart sensor applications in complex and extreme conditions.

Solid interfacial contact loss is a severe challenge that impedes the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;inspired smart electrolyte film, with excellent compatibility and self&#8208;adaptability, that can control the interfacial kinetics to form a durable stable interface, is reported. The related solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate extended&#8208;cycling performance at room temperature.








Abstract
Improving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) is a severe challenge because of the notorious solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact loss originating from the repeated expansion and contraction of the Li anodes. Here, it is reported that high&#8208;performance SSBs are enabled by constructing brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar electrolytes that can dynamically adapt to the interface changes during cycling. An electrolyte film with a high mechanical strain (250%) is fabricated by filling viscoelastic (600% strain) and piezoelectric block&#8208;copolymer electrolytes (mortar) into a mixed conductor Li0.33La0.56TiO3&#8208;x nanofiber film (brick). During Li&#8208;plating, the electrolytes can homogenize the interfacial electric field and generate piezoelectricity to promote uniform Li&#8208;deposition, while the mortar can adhere to the Li&#8208;anode without interfacial disintegration in the reversed Li&#8208;stripping. As a result, the electrolytes show excellent compatibility with the electrodes, leading to a long electrochemical cyclability at room temperature. The symmetrical Li//Li cells run stably for 1880 h without forming dendrites, and the LiFePO4/Li full batteries deliver high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.5%) and capacity retention (&gt;85%) over 550 cycles. More practically, the pouch cells exhibit excellent flexibility and safety for potential practical applications.

         <title>Modeling Electron&#8208;Transfer Degradation of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, March 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operational lifetime of an organic electroluminescence device is governed by the intrinsic degradation of its constituent materials. A chemical and numerical model capable of predicting the operational stability of emitting layers exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence is established. Thereby, guidelines of choosing materials toward the improved device lifetime are provided.








Abstract
The operational lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) is governed primarily by the intrinsic degradation of the materials. Therefore, a chemical model capable of predicting the operational stability is highly important. Here, a degradation model for OLEDs that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is constructed and validated. The degradation model involves Langevin recombination of charge carriers on hosts, followed by the generation of a polaron pair through reductive electron transfer from a dopant to a host exciton as the initiation steps. The polarons undergo spontaneous decomposition, which competes with ultrafast recovery of the intact materials through charge recombination. Electrical and spectroscopic investigations provide information about the kinetics of each step in the operation and degradation of the devices, thereby enabling the building of mass balances for the key species in the emitting layers. Numerical solutions enable predictions of temporal decreases of the dopant concentration in various TADF emitting layers. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental operational stabilities. This research disentangles the chemical processes in intrinsic electron&#8208;transfer degradation, and provides a useful foundation for improving the longevity of OLEDs.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Enantiomorphic 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality dependence of a novel optoelectronic phenomenon, circular photogalvanic effect, is observed in a pair of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with introduced chiral molecules. The sign reversal of zero&#8208;bias photocurrents between enantiomers indicates the chirality&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;polarized bands induced by spin&#8211;orbit coupling.








Abstract
The control of the optoelectronic properties of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D&#8208;OIHP) lead halides is an increasingly prevalent topic. Herein, the observation of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in new enantiomorphic 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is reported, which are synthesized as a first OIHP&#8208;related system belonging to a chiral space group by incorporating organic chiral cations into the inorganic layers of lead iodides. The CPGE is an optoelectronic phenomenon associated with the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of heavy atoms in noncentrosymmetric systems. Owing to the CPGE, light&#8208;helicity&#8208;dependent steady photocurrents are generated without an external bias voltage under the irradiation of circularly polarized light. Furthermore, the sign reversal of the CPGE photocurrent depending on the chirality of the designed 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is observed. This result indicates formation of the theoretically predicted radial spin&#8208;polarized texture in k&#8208;space of chiral systems owing to spin&#8208;momentum locking. Hence, chiral 2D&#8208;OIHP lead halides can be a promising platform for engineering opto&#8208;spintronic functionalities.

         <title>A Hippocampus&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Gated Organic Artificial Synapse for Simultaneous Sensing of a Neurotransmitter and Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;inspired organic artificial synapse that can simultaneously detect a neurotransmitter and light is prepared using a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor with a functionalized extended&#8208;gate electrode. In addition to mimicking typical synaptic functions such as short&#8208; and long&#8208;term potentiation and synaptic weight control, hippocampal synaptic strengthening effects in response to repetitive dopamine injection and light illumination are emulated.








Abstract
Organic neuromorphic devices and sensors that mimic the functions of chemical synapses and sensory perception in humans have received much attention for next&#8208;generation computing and integrated logic circuits. Despite recent advances, organic artificial synapses capable of detecting both neurotransmitters in liquid environments and light are not reported.

&lt;p&gt;A hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;inspired organic artificial synapse that can simultaneously detect a neurotransmitter and light is prepared using a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor with a functionalized extended&#8208;gate electrode. In addition to mimicking typical synaptic functions such as short&#8208; and long&#8208;term potentiation and synaptic weight control, hippocampal synaptic strengthening effects in response to repetitive dopamine injection and light illumination are emulated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic neuromorphic devices and sensors that mimic the functions of chemical synapses and sensory perception in humans have received much attention for next&#8208;generation computing and integrated logic circuits. Despite recent advances, organic artificial synapses capable of detecting both neurotransmitters in liquid environments and light are not reported. Herein, inspired by hippocampal synapses, a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor platform with a photoconductive polymer semiconductor, a ferroelectric insulator of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE), and an extended&#8208;gate electrode functionalized with boronic acid is developed to simultaneously detect the neurotransmitter dopamine and light.

First, the design of catalytic centers for MOF&#8208;based/derived electrocatalysts is summarized and compared from the aspects of chemical composition optimization and structural functionalization at the atomic and molecular levels. Subsequently, the fast&#8208;growing breakthroughs in catalytic activities, identification of highly active sites, and fundamental mechanisms are thoroughly discussed. Finally, a comprehensive commentary on the current primary challenges and future perspectives in water splitting and its commercialization for hydrogen production is provided.

         <title>A Tensile&#8208;Strained Pt&#8211;Rh Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Remarkably Boosts Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Rh atoms on intermetallic PtBi matrix are achieved by atomic galvanic replacement, and the system transforms into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy via electrochemical dealloying. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performances including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
The rational design and control of electrocatalysts at single&#8208;atomic sites could enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic properties, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic alloys. Herein, the first example of isolated Rh atoms on ordered PtBi nanoplates (PtBi&#8208;Rh1) by atomic galvanic replacement, and their subsequent transformation into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy (PtBi@PtRh1) via electrochemical dealloying are presented. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performance including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergism between effective Rh1 and tensile strain in boosting the adsorption of ethanol and key surface intermediates and the C&#63743;C bond cleavage of the intermediates. The facile synthesis of the tensile&#8208;strained single&#8208;atom alloy provides a novel strategy to construct model nanostructures, accelerating the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the synthesis of 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is presented. While the ALD of thin films on 2D TMCs can modify the TMC properties, that of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs can enhance the device performance. The characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs applied to nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are a large family of 2D materials with different properties, and are promising candidates for a wide range of applications such as nanoelectronics, sensors, energy conversion, and energy storage. In the research of new materials, the development and investigation of industry&#8208;compatible synthesis techniques is of key importance. In this respect, it is important to study 2D TMC materials synthesized by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, which is widely applied in industries. In addition to the synthesis of 2D TMCs, ALD is used to modulate the characteristic of 2D TMCs such as their carrier density and morphology. So far, the improvement of thin film uniformity without oxidation and the synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials on 2D TMCs have been the research focus. Herein, the synthesis and modulation of 2D TMCs by ALD is described, and the characteristics of ALD&#8208;based TMCs used in nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy applications are discussed.

         <title>Recent Progress in Advanced Electrocatalyst Design for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction is the key to realizing the application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The most recent advances in advanced electrocatalysts for enhancing acidic oxygen evolution reaction, including Ir&#8208;based, Ru&#8208;based, nonprecious metal&#8208;based, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, are comprehensively summarized in this Progress Report. The strategies summarized in this work are of benefit to more advanced electrocatalysts design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers hold great significance for renewable energy storage and conversion. The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main roadblocks that hinder the practical application of PEM water electrolyzers. Highly active, cost&#8208;effective, and durable electrocatalysts are indispensable for lowering the high kinetic barrier of OER to achieve boosted reaction kinetics. To date, a wide spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts has been designed and synthesized for enhanced acidic OER performance, though Ir and Ru based nanostructures still represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In this Progress Report, recent research progress in advanced electrocatalysts for improved acidic OER performance is summarized. First, fundamental understanding about acidic OER including reaction mechanisms and atomic understanding to acidic OER for rational design of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed. Thereafter, an overview of the progress in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER electrocatalysts is provided in terms of catalyst category, i.e., metallic nanostructures (Ir and Ru based), precious metal oxides, nonprecious metal oxides, and carbon based nanomaterials. Finally, perspectives to the future development of acidic OER are provided from the aspects of reaction mechanism investigation and more efficient electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Manipulating Nonlinear Optical Response via Domain Control in Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating nonlinear optical response via domain control in nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) composite is proposed. An unusual nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is observed in NIG composite with specific domain structure. The constructed NIG composite is further demonstrated for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulse.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) is an exciting class of composites, because it can not only combine the advantages of crystal and glass materials but also potentially generate new physical phenomenon in a cooperative manner. Herein, the nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction processes in a broad range of NIG composites homogeneously embedded with LiNbO3 are investigated. It is shown that, by rational control of the organization manner of crystal and glass phases, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) can be precisely tuned. Importantly, an unusual SHG phenomenon, transverse SHG (TSHG), can be realized in the special region of the microstructure map combined with the features of high loading, nanoscale size, and homogenous distribution of nanocrystals. Furthermore, NIG composites exhibit broadband optical response, allowing TSHG in a wide waveband region to be achieved. Based on the above effects, the applications of the constructed NIG composite for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulses with femtosecond time scales are demonstrated. Indeed, the findings outline a fundamental principle to design NIG configurations for creating new properties, providing new directions for expanding the scope of NIG functional materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Alloys Reveal a Distinct Metabolic Phenotype of Early Gastric Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic PdPtAu alloys with optimized elemental composition and surface structure benefit enhanced laser desorption/ionization, with photoinduced charge/energy transfer and size&#8208;exclusive effect. By further coupling with mass spectrometry, PdPtAu alloys yield direct metabolic profiling of trace plasma in seconds. A gastric cancer (GC)&#8208;specific metabolic phenotype is identified, shedding light on the precise and non&#8208;invasive GC diagnosis at an early stage.








Abstract
Gastric cancer (GC) is a multifactorial process, accompanied by alterations in metabolic pathways. Non&#8208;invasive metabolic profiling facilitates GC diagnosis at early stage leading to an improved prognostic outcome. Herein, mesoporous PdPtAu alloys are designed to characterize the metabolic profiles in human blood. The elemental composition is optimized with heterogeneous surface plasmonic resonance, offering preferred charge transfer for photoinduced desorption/ionization and enhanced photothermal conversion for thermally driven desorption. The surface structure of PdPtAu is further tuned with controlled mesopores, accommodating metabolites only, rather than large interfering compounds. Consequently, the optimized PdPtAu alloy yields direct metabolic fingerprints by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry in seconds, consuming 500 nL of native plasma. A distinct metabolic phenotype is revealed for early GC by sparse learning, resulting in precise GC diagnosis with an area under the curve of 0.942. It is envisioned that the plasmonic alloy will open up a new era of minimally invasive blood analysis to improve the surveillance of cancer patients in the clinical setting.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells are fabricated, achieving a significant JSC boost, by virtue of an optimized crystalline feature with the formation of a eutectic mixture with better acceptor crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and recombination, and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current boost.








Abstract
The intrinsic electronic properties of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in coupling with morphological features dictate the output in organic solar cells (OSCs). New physical properties of intimate eutectic mixing are used in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 ternary blends to fine&#8208;tune the bulk heterojunction thin film morphology as well as their electronic properties. With enhanced thin film crystallinity and improved carrier transport, a significant JSC amplification is achieved due to the formation of eutectic fibrillar lamellae and reduced defects state density. Material wise, aligned cascading energy levels with much larger driving force, and suppressed recombination channels confirm efficient charge transfer and transport, enabling an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.84%. These results reveal the importance of utilizing specific material interactions to control the crystalline habit in blended films to form a well&#8208;suited morphology in guiding superior performances, which is of high demand in the next episode of OSC fabrication toward 20% PCE.

         <title>Biologically Excretable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Dots for Visualizing Through the Marmosets Intravitally: Horizons in Future Clinical Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long aliphatic chains of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;gens are conducive to the excretion of AIE dots from an animal's body. The deep micro cerebrovasculature in marmosets is visualized through the thinned skull. Non&#8208;invasive and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb imaging is utilized in non&#8208;human primates. This work is believed to provide crucial ideas to advance the development of biosafe AIE dots and future nanomedicine.








Abstract
Superb reliability and biocompatibility equip aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dots with tremendous potential for fluorescence bioimaging. However, there is still a chronic lack of design instructions of excretable and bright AIE emitters. Here, a kind of PEGylated AIE (OTPA&#8208;BBT) dots with strong absorption and extremely high second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) PLQY of 13.6% is designed, and a long&#8208;aliphatic&#8208;chain design blueprint contributing to their excretion from an animal's body is proposed. Assisted by the OTPA&#8208;BBT dots with bright fluorescence beyond 1100&#160;nm and even 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), large&#8208;depth cerebral vasculature (beyond 600&#160;&#181;m) as well as real&#8208;time blood flow are monitored through a thinned skull, and noninvasive NIR&#8208;IIb imaging with rich high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information gives a precise presentation of gastrointestinal tract in marmosets. Importantly, after intravenous or oral administration, the definite excretion of OTPA&#8208;BBT dots from the body is demonstrated, which provides influential evidence of biosafety.

         <title>Durable and Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Soft Peripheral Neuroprosthetics for In Vivo Bidirectional Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft but durable fatigue&#8208;resistant neuroprosthetic device is proposed for peripheral nerve interfacing based on a self&#8208;recoverable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite can spontaneously recover its electrical conductivity even after repetitive degradations by severe mechanical deformation. The neuroprosthetics implanted on a rat sciatic nerve achieve stable bidirectional signaling for 5 weeks. Deep neural network analysis predicts joint position of the rat precisely.








Abstract
Soft neuroprosthetics that monitor signals from sensory neurons and deliver motor information can potentially replace damaged nerves. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability of devices interfacing peripheral nerves is challenging, since dynamic mechanical deformations in peripheral nerves cause material degradation in devices. Here, a durable and fatigue&#8208;resistant soft neuroprosthetic device is reported for bidirectional signaling on peripheral nerves. The neuroprosthetic device is made of a nanocomposite of gold nanoshell (AuNS)&#8208;coated silver (Ag) flakes dispersed in a tough, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP). The dynamic self&#8208;healing property of the nanocomposite allows the percolation network of AuNS&#8208;coated flakes to rebuild after degradation. Therefore, its degraded electrical and mechanical performance by repetitive, irregular, and intense deformations at the device&#8211;nerve interface can be spontaneously self&#8208;recovered.

&lt;p&gt;A soft but durable fatigue&#8208;resistant neuroprosthetic device is proposed for peripheral nerve interfacing based on a self&#8208;recoverable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite can spontaneously recover its electrical conductivity even after repetitive degradations by severe mechanical deformation. The neuroprosthetics implanted on a rat sciatic nerve achieve stable bidirectional signaling for 5 weeks. Deep neural network analysis predicts joint position of the rat precisely.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft neuroprosthetics that monitor signals from sensory neurons and deliver motor information can potentially replace damaged nerves. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability of devices interfacing peripheral nerves is challenging, since dynamic mechanical deformations in peripheral nerves cause material degradation in devices. Here, a durable and fatigue&#8208;resistant soft neuroprosthetic device is reported for bidirectional signaling on peripheral nerves. The neuroprosthetic device is made of a nanocomposite of gold nanoshell (AuNS)&#8208;coated silver (Ag) flakes dispersed in a tough, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP). The dynamic self&#8208;healing property of the nanocomposite allows the percolation network of AuNS&#8208;coated flakes to rebuild after degradation. Therefore, its degraded electrical and mechanical performance by repetitive, irregular, and intense deformations at the device&#8211;nerve interface can be spontaneously self&#8208;recovered. When the device is implanted on a rat sciatic nerve, stable bidirectional signaling is obtained for over 5 weeks. Neural signals collected from a live walking rat using these neuroprosthetics are analyzed by a deep neural network to predict the joint position precisely. This result demonstrates that durable soft neuroprosthetics can facilitate collection and analysis of large&#8208;sized in vivo data for solving challenges in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fermi Velocity Reduction of Dirac Fermions around the Brillouin Zone Center in In2Se3&#8211;Bilayer Graphene Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy to construct moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center is realized by folding graphene Dirac cones in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructures. The Fermi velocity of the moir&#233; Dirac cones is reduced by &#8776;23%, and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point is elongated. Both features further confirm the moir&#233; Dirac fermion renormalization and interactions.








Abstract
Emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, Mott&#8208;like insulators, and the peculiar quantum Hall effect in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures are proposed to stem from the superlattice&#8208;induced renormalization of (moir&#233;) Dirac fermions at the graphene Brillouin zone corners. Understanding the corresponding band structure commonly demands photoemission spectroscopy with both sub&#8208;meV resolution and large&#8208;momentum coverage, beyond the capability of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Here the realization of moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructure is reported. The renormalization is evidenced by reduced Fermi velocity (&#8776;23%) of the moir&#233; Dirac cones and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point where they intersect. While there have been many theoretical predictions and much indirect experimental evidence, the findings here are the first direct observation of Fermi velocity reduction of the moir&#233; Dirac cones. These features suggest strong In2Se3/graphene interlayer coupling, which is comparable with that in twisted bilayer graphene. The strategy expands the choice of materials in the heterostructure design and stimulates subsequent broad investigations of emergent physics at the sub&#8208;meV energy scale.

         <title>2D MXenes: Tunable Mechanical and Tribological Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have grown to prominence due to their impressive conductive and electrochemical behavior. Although the mechanical and tribological properties are critical in almost all MXenes applications, they are yet to be fully explored. An in&#8208;depth perspective of the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties and their effects on current and future applications is provided.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, known as MXenes, were discovered in 2011 and have grown to prominence in energy storage, catalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, wireless communications, electronic, sensors, and environmental and biomedical applications. In addition to their high electrical conductivity and electrochemically active behavior, MXenes&#8217; mechanical properties, flexibility, and strong adhesion properties play crucial roles in almost all of these growing applications. Although these properties prove to be critical in MXenes&#8217; impressive performance, the mechanical and tribological understanding of MXenes, as well as their relation to the synthesis process, is yet to be fully explored. Here, a fundamental overview of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties is provided and the effects of MXenes&#8217; compositions, synthesis, and processing steps on these properties are discussed. Additionally, a critical perspective of the compositional control of MXenes for innovative structural, low&#8208;friction, and low&#8208;wear performance in current and upcoming applications of MXenes is provided. It is established here that the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological behavior is essential for their quickly growing applications.

         <title>Tunable Stochasticity in an Artificial Spin Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls within artificial spin networks leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network can produce a controllable random response, as demonstrated by recreating a nanoscale version of the Galton board, the iconic experiment historically used to showcase the emergence of order from chaos.








Abstract
Metamaterials present the possibility of artificially generating advanced functionalities through engineering of their internal structure. Artificial spin networks, in which a large number of nanoscale magnetic elements are coupled together, are promising metamaterial candidates that enable the control of collective magnetic behavior through tuning of the local interaction between elements. In this work, the motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls in an artificial spin network leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external magnetic field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network produces a controllable random response exploiting intrinsic stochasticity within magnetic domain&#8208;wall motion at the nanoscale. An iconic demonstration used to illustrate the control of randomness is the Galton board. In this system, multiple balls fall into an array of pegs to generate a bell&#8208;shaped curve that can be modified via the array spacing or the tilt of the board. A&#160;nanoscale recreation of this experiment using an artificial spin network is employed to demonstrate tunable stochasticity. This type of tunable stochastic network opens new paths toward post&#8208;Von Neumann computing architectures such as Bayesian sensing or random neural networks, in which stochasticity is harnessed to efficiently perform complex computational tasks.

         <title>Nanoburl Graphites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the strengthening mechanism of burls in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; that are embedded in graphite (0002) planes to stop cleavage along the graphite (0002) planes, significantly strengthening the bulk graphites.








Abstract
A critical challenge for the application of graphite is low strength, which originates from the easy cleavage of graphite (0002) planes. Inspired by the burl strengthening mechanism observed in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; embedded in graphite (0002) lattice planes to eliminate the graphite (0002) plane cleavage of bulk graphites prepared by spark plasma sintering from graphite powders. Covalent bonds are built between carbon atoms by sp3 hybridization at the interface between the graphite onions and flakes, which triggers an electron redistribution to form positive/negative charge domains within. Thus, pairs of pseudo&#8208;Schottky junctions are created by the hybridization, which further enhances the bonding between the graphite onions and flakes. With these bonding mechanisms, and with voids between the graphite powders filled in by the volume expansion associated with the change of nanodiamonds to the graphite onions, the loose compaction of graphite powder becomes consolidated at 1700&#160;&#176;C. The proposed nanoburl mechanism shows its potential and bestows the nanoburl graphites with strength five times that of conventional graphites prepared from graphite powders. The concept of nanoburl strengthening can be important in the microstructural design and property enhancement of other layered materials.

         <title>Anomalous Motion of Charged Domain Walls and Associated Negative Capacitance in Copper&#8211;Chlorine Boracite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During switching, specific charged 90&#176; domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite are seen to move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied electric field. Polarization&#8211;field hysteresis loops show negative gradients and measured switching currents confirm the negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.








Abstract
During switching, the microstructure of a ferroelectric normally adapts to align internal dipoles with external electric fields. Favorably oriented dipolar regions (domains) grow at the expense of those in unfavorable orientations and this is manifested in a predictable field&#8208;induced motion of the walls that separate one domain from the next. Here, the discovery that specific charged 90&#176;domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied field, is reported. Polarization&#8211;field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops, inferred from optical imaging, show negative gradients and non&#8208;transient negative capacitance, throughout the P&#8211;E cycle. Switching currents (generated by the relative motion between domain walls and sensing electrodes) confirm this, insofar as their signs are opposite to those expected conventionally. For any given bias, the integrated switching charge due to this anomalous wall motion is directly proportional to time, indicating that the magnitude of the negative capacitance component should be inversely related to frequency. This passes Jonscher's test for the misinterpretation of positive inductance and gives confidence that field&#8208;induced motion of these specific charged domain walls generates a measurable negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.

&lt;p&gt;During switching, specific charged 90&#176; domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite are seen to move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied electric field.

         <title>The Electrostatic Attraction and Catalytic Effect Enabled by Ionic&#8211;Covalent Organic Nanosheets on MXene for Separator Modification of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides is presented by way of guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets on the surface of conductive Ti3C2. The modified separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur electrodes with significantly enhanced reversible capacity, areal capacity, volumetric capacity, and cycling stability.








Abstract
It is of great significance to mediate the redox kinetics and shuttle effect of polysulfides in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, a new strategy is proposed based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides for the modification of the polypropylene (PP) separator. Guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets (iCON) on the surface of Ti3C2 is presented as a coating layer for the PP separator. The synergetic effects of Ti3C2 and iCON provide new platforms to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, expedite the redox kinetics of sulfur species, and promote efficient conversion of the intercepted polysulfides. The functional separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance. The average capacity decay per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C is as low as 0.006%. The separator is even effective in the case of sulfur content of 90 wt% and sulfur loading of 7.6 mg cm&#8722;2; the reversible capacity, areal capacity, and volumetric capacity at 0.1 C are as high as 1186 mA h g&#8722;1, 9.01 mA h cm&#8722;2, and 1201 mA h cm&#8722;3, respectively. This work provides a promising approach toward separator modification for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>An Ultrasoft Self&#8208;Fused Supramolecular Polymer Hydrogel for Completely Preventing Postoperative Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One more methylene makes a difference: introducing one extra methylene between two amides in the side chain of poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) weakens the H&#8208;bonding interaction, resulting in an ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel that can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and antifouling ability, which is harnessed to completely prevent postoperative tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The intermolecular H&#8208;bonding density heavily influences the gelation and rheological behavior of hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer hydrogels, thus offering a delicate pathway to tailor their physicochemical properties for meeting a specific biomedical application. Herein, one methylene spacer between two amides in the side chain of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) is introduced to generate a variant monomer, N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide (NAAA). Polymerization of NAAA in aqueous solution affords an unprecedented ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel due to weakened H&#8208;bonds caused by an extra methylene spacer, which is verified by variable&#8208;temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and simulation calculation. Intriguingly, poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) (PNAAA) hydrogel can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and excellent antifouling capability that results from the weakened dual amide H&#8208;bonding interactions and enhanced water&#8208;amide H&#8208;bonding interactions. This self&#8208;fused PNAAA hydrogel can completely inhibit postoperative abdominal adhesion and recurrent adhesion after adhesiolysis in vivo. This transient hydrogel network allows for its disintegration and excretion from the body. The molecular mechanism studies reveal the signal pathway of PNAAA hydrogel in inhibiting inflammatory response and regulating fibrinolytic system balance. This self&#8208;fused, antifouling ultrasoft supramolecular hydrogel is promising as a barrier biomaterial for completely preventing postoperative tissue adhesion.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Facilitated Aggregation of Tumor&#8208;Specific Transmembrane Receptors for Signaling Activation and Converting Immunologically Cold to Hot Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based molecule&#8208;targeted anticancer agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can precisely visualize transmembrane EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, selectively kill EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells through making the receptors form large aggregates that activate antitumorigenic signaling, and effectively convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by recruiting tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide systems are attracting increasing interest in the field of cancer theranostics. Additionally, transformation of the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into hot is of great importance for obtaining high antitumor responses for most immunotherapies. However, as far as it is known, there are nearly no studies on self&#8208;assembling peptides reported to be able to convert cold to hot tumors. Herein, a self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based cancer theranostic agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can target tumor&#8208;specific transmembrane Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) receptors selectively and make the receptors form large aggregates. Such aggregate formation promotes the cross&#8208;phosphorylations among EphA2 receptors, leading to signal transduction of antitumor pathway. As a consequence, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA can not only visualize EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, but also specifically suppress the EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. What is more, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA also serves as an effective agent to convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by inducing the immunogenic cell death of EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and recruiting massive tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells. This study, thus, introduces a new category of agents capable of converting cold to hot tumors by pure supramolecular self&#8208;assembly without any aid of known anticancer drugs.

         <title>In Situ Ultrafast and Patterned Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides from Inkjet&#8208;Printed Aqueous Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area patterned transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films with centimeter size and good controllability of the thickness and TMDC heterostructures are achieved by a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy involving printing using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer with precisely tuned inkjet&#8208;printing parameters followed by a rapid heating process. High&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter size can be easily synthesized within 30 s by this method.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been widely used to synthesize high&#8208;quality 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) from different precursors. At present, quantitative control of the precursor with high precision and good repeatability is still challenging. Moreover, the process to synthesize TMDCs with designed patterns is complicated. Here, by using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer, an in situ aqueous precursor with robust usage control at the picogram (10&#8722;12 g) level is achieved, and by precisely tuning the inkjet&#8208;printing parameters, followed by a rapid heating process, large&#8208;area patterned TMDC films with centimeter size and good thickness controllability, as well as heterostructures of the TMDCs, are achieved facilely, and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter&#8208;size can be easily synthesized within 30 s (corresponding to a growth rate up to 36.4 &#181;m s&#8722;1). The resulting monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 21 and 54 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively. The study paves a simple and robust way for the in situ ultrafast and patterned growth of high&#8208;quality TMDCs and heterostructures with promising industrialization prospects. Moreover, this ultrafast and green method can be easily used for synthesis of other 2D materials with slight modification.

At present, quantitative control of the precursor with high precision and good repeatability is still challenging. Moreover, the process to synthesize TMDCs with designed patterns is complicated. Here, by using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer, an in situ aqueous precursor with robust usage control at the picogram (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; g) level is achieved, and by precisely tuning the inkjet&#8208;printing parameters, followed by a rapid heating process, large&#8208;area patterned TMDC films with centimeter size and good thickness controllability, as well as heterostructures of the TMDCs, are achieved facilely, and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter&#8208;size can be easily synthesized within 30 s (corresponding to a growth rate up to 36.4 &#181;m s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 21 and 54 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The study paves a simple and robust way for the in situ ultrafast and patterned growth of high&#8208;quality TMDCs and heterostructures with promising industrialization prospects. Moreover, this ultrafast and green method can be easily used for synthesis of other 2D materials with slight modification.&lt;/p&gt;

Alginate&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;guided delivery of a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus vector coding for a human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) gene sequence (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) safely enhances the repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects and reduces perifocal osteoarthritis and inflammation in minipigs in vivo over one year via effective IGF&#8208;I overexpression relative to control (reporter lacZ/AlgPH155) vector delivery.








Abstract
The regeneration of focal articular cartilage defects is complicated by the reduced quality of the repair tissue and the potential development of perifocal osteoarthritis (OA). Biomaterial&#8208;guided gene therapy may enhance cartilage repair by controlling the release of therapeutic sequences in a spatiotemporal manner. Here, the benefits of delivering a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus (rAAV) vector coding for the human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) via an alginate hydrogel (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) to enhance repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects following microfracture surgery after one year in minipigs versus control (lacZ/AlgPH155) treatment are reported. Sustained IGF&#8208;I overexpression is significantly achieved in the repair tissue of defects treated with IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 versus those receiving lacZ/AlgPH155 for one year and in the cartilage surrounding the defects. Administration of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 significantly improves parameters of cartilage repair at one year relative to lacZ/AlgPH155 (semiquantitative total histological score, cell densities, matrix deposition) without deleterious or immune reactions. Remarkably, delivery of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 also significantly reduces perifocal OA and inflammation after one year versus lacZ/AlgPH155 treatment. Biomaterial&#8208;guided rAAV gene transfer represents a valuable clinical approach to promote cartilage repair and to protect against OA.

         <title>2D&#8208;Berry&#8208;Curvature&#8208;Driven Large Anomalous Hall Effect in Layered Topological Nodal&#8208;Line MnAlGe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered topological nodal&#8208;line magnet MnAlGe is reported. The material exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the unique 2D Berry curvature distribution. The search for new layered topological magnets and exploration of magnetism and topological properties are enabled by this work.








Abstract
Topological magnets comprising 2D magnetic layers with Curie temperatures (TC) exceeding room temperature are key for dissipationless quantum transport devices. However, the identification of a material with 2D ferromagnetic planes that exhibits an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;magnetization remains a challenge. This study reports a ferromagnetic, topological, nodal&#8208;line, and semimetal MnAlGe composed of square&#8208;net Mn layers that are separated by nonmagnetic Al&#8211;Ge spacers. The 2D ferromagnetic Mn layers exhibit an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization below TC&#160;&#8776;&#160;503&#160;K. Density functional calculations demonstrate that 2D arrays of Mn atoms control the electrical, magnetic, and therefore topological properties in MnAlGe. The unique 2D distribution of the Berry curvature resembles the 2D Fermi surface of the bands that form the topological nodal line near the Fermi energy. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of &#8776;700 S&#160;cm&#8211;1 is obtained at 2 K and related to this nodal&#8208;line&#8208;induced 2D Berry curvature distribution. The high transition temperature, large anisotropic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetism, and natural heterostructure&#8208;type atomic arrangements consisting of magnetic Mn and nonmagnetic Al/Ge elements render nodal&#8208;line MnAlGe one of the few, unique, and layered topological ferromagnets that have ever been observed.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface is studied using near&#8208;field techniques to show conclusively topological transition accompanied by the emergence of the Wannier&#8208;type dipole polarization. Measurements across different boundaries reveal a hierarchy of topological boundary states: i) the first order edge states and ii) the second order corner states, including states induced by the long&#8208;range interactions within the metasurface.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight&#8208;binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long&#8208;range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all&#8208;dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier&#8208;type polarization. Two kinds of near&#8208;field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near&#8208;field imaging using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near&#8208;field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all&#8208;dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Photodetectors with Excellent Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing flexible perovskite photodetector is presented. The lateral photodetector shows a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a good stability to both moisture and mechanical damage. Meanwhile, damaged perovskite film can repair cracks with the assistance of a poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold under a humid environment and recover to 90% of its initial performance for several cycles.








Abstract
Flexible devices are urgently required to meet the demands of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and metal halide perovskites are proven to be suitable materials for realizing flexible photovoltaic devices. However, the tolerance to moisture corrosion and repeated mechanical bending remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite devices. Herein, a self&#8208;healing formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) film is fabricated to cure mechanical damage by absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment. A poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold is designed not only to stabilize the black phase of the FAPbI3 film but also to endow it with self&#8208;healing ability in a humid environment. The photodetector based on a self&#8208;healing film exhibits a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A W&#8722;1 and recovers to over 90% of the initial responsivity after the self&#8208;healing process. This work provides an effective self&#8208;healing strategy to stabilize the operation of flexible perovskite devices under normal high&#8208;humidity environmental conditions.

         <title>General and Robust Photothermal&#8208;Heating&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Efficiency Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deposited Co3O4 thin film manifests a compelling photothermal effect upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of both inner BiVO4 nanoworms and outer FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalyst in situ, thereby leading to superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23 VRHE in a judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode.








Abstract
The ability of photoanodes to simultaneously tailor light absorption, charge separation, and water oxidation processes represents an important endeavor toward highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, a robust strategy is reported to render markedly improved PEC water splitting via sandwiching a photothermal Co3O4 layer between a BiVO4 photoanode film and an FeOOH/NiOOH electrocatalyst sheet. The deposited Co3O4 layer manifests compelling photothermal effect upon near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of the photoanodes in situ, leading to extended light absorption, enhanced charge transfer, and accelerated water oxidation kinetics simultaneously. The judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode renders a superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible reference electrode (VRHE) with outstanding applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.72% at 0.6&#160;VRHE. In addition to the metal oxide, a wide variety of metal sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides (e.g., CoS, CoN, and CoP) can be exploited as the heaters to yield high&#8208;performance BiVO4&#8208;based photoanodes. Apart from BiVO4, other metal oxides (e.g., Fe2O3 and TiO2) can also be covered by photothermal materials to impart significantly promoted water splitting. This simple yet general strategy provides a unique platform to capitalize on their photothermal characteristics to engineer high&#8208;performing energy conversion and storage materials and devices.

         <title>MBene as a Theranostic Nanoplatform for Photocontrolled Intratumoral Retention and Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D zirconium boride nanosheets (ZBNs) are developed as a versatile drug delivery nanoplatform to realize near infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release by the photo&#8208;pyrolysis of borate ester on the surface. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery by nanomaterials is important to improve tumor therapy efficacy and reduce toxic side effects, but its efficiency is quite limited. In this work, a new type of MBene, zirconium boride nanosheet (ZBN), as a versatile nanoplatform to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release is developed. ZBN exhibits high NIR&#8208;photothermal conversion efficiency (76.8%), surface modification with hyaluronic acid (HA) by polyol&#8722;borate esterfication endows ZBN&#8208;HA with good dispersion, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester causes HA detachment and ZBN aggregation, enabling NIR&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention to achieve high intratumoral accumulation. By virtue of surface borate esterfication, polyol chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), and NO prodrug (&#946;&#8208;galactosyl&#8208;diazeniumdiolate, Gal&#8208;NO) can be efficiently and stably conjugated on the surface of ZBN&#8208;HA (1.21&#160;g DOX or 0.57&#160;g Gal&#8208;NO per gram ZBN) without visible drug leakage, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester enables NIR&#8208;controlled drug release with high responsiveness and controllability. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN&#8208;HA/DOX and ZBN&#8208;HA/NO nanomedicines eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment and killing cancer cells in primary tumors. The developed NIR&#8208;photothermal MBene is confirmed as a versatile nanoplatform capable of high&#8208;efficacy tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery and controlled drug release.

         <title>Tunable Electrocatalytic Behavior of Sodiated MoS2 Active Sites toward Efficient Sulfur Redox Reactions in Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate multifunctional S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance and prolonged cycling lifespan in room&#8208;temperature Na&#8211;S batteries. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, and the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature (RT) sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and resource abundance. The research progress on RT Na&#8211;S batteries, however, has been greatly hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. Herein, an elaborate multifunctional architecture, consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon skeletons and tunable MoS2 sulfiphilic sites, is fabricated via a simple one&#8208;pot reaction followed by in situ sulfurization. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, especially the conversion from long&#8208;chain Na2Sn (4 &#8804; n&#160;&#8804; 8) to short&#8208;chain Na2S2 and Na2S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS2 exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS2 sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na2S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na&#8211;S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.

         <title>Significantly Improving the Bioefficacy for Rheumatoid Arthritis with Supramolecular Nanoformulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of active nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) protein complexes is developed through non&#8208;covalent supramolecular assemble approach. Extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics are realized for long&#8208;acting rheumatoid arthritis therapy.








Abstract
As a typical inflammatory disease with chronic pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) generally requires long&#8208;term treatment with frequent injection administration at 1&#8211;2 times per day, because common medications such as interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) have poor bioavailability and very limited half&#8208;life residence. Here a novel strategy to fabricate nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered IL1ra protein complexes, yielding ultralong&#8208;lasting bioefficacy is developed rationally. Using rat models, it is shown that these nanotherapeutics significantly improved drug regimen to a single subcutaneous administration in a 14&#8208;day therapy, suggesting their extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics. Specifically, the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the nanoformulations are boosted to the level of 30 h and by 7 times, respectively, significantly greater than other systems. This new strategy thus holds great promise to potently improve patient compliance in RA therapy, and it can be adapted for other therapies that suffer similar drawbacks.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled with independent control of the amplitude and phase of light, a general platform is proposed for completely decoupling the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities of metasurfaces. As a paradigm, a single&#8208;cell metasurface implementing the dual&#8208;functions of a metalens and a nanoprint is demonstrated; high&#8208;performance characteristics are demonstrated for both functions.








Abstract
Metasurfaces, simultaneously operating in near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, can be employed as a promising candidate to implement different functions, thus significantly improving the information density, security, and system integration. Recent works have showcased some approaches for decoupling&#8208;at&#8208;large between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, but unfortunately, their coupling effects are just reduced and mitigated to some extent rather than eradicated, which in turn leads to the performance limitation of metadevices. Herein, we propose a general platform for the complete rift between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, enabled by strictly decoupled manipulation of optical amplitude and phase, leading to their distinct functions in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, respectively. This concept is experimentally demonstrated by integrating the functions of a phase&#8208;only metalens and an amplitude&#8208;only grayscale&#8208;imaging nanoprint into a single&#8208;cell metasurface. Because of their completely decoupled functions, both meta&#8208;elements show high&#8208;performance characteristics, i.e., imaging quality close to the diffraction limit and high&#8208;definition grayscale&#8208;imaging with resolution as high as 63&#160;500 dots per inch (dpi). The validated recipe may empower advanced explorations and applications in highly integrated nano&#8208;optoelectronics requiring high performance and less crosstalk.

         <title>Porosimetry for Thin Films of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: A Comparison of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy and Adsorption&#8208;Based Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity characterization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks deposited as thin films on surfaces is challenging and requires a combination of techniques. The use of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy is introduced, and it is compared in a comprehensive and tutorial way to conventional adsorption&#8208;based methods (quartz crystal microbalance gravimetry, ellipsometric porosimetry, and krypton physisorption).








Abstract
Thin films of crystalline and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great potential in membranes, sensors, and microelectronic chips. While the morphology and crystallinity of MOF films can be evaluated using widely available techniques, characterizing their pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area is challenging due to the low amount of material and substrate effects. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is introduced as a powerful method to obtain pore size information and depth profiling in MOF films. The complementarity of this approach to established physisorption&#8208;based methods such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) gravimetry, ellipsometric porosimetry (EP), and Kr physisorption (KrP) is illustrated. This comprehensive discussion on MOF thin film porosimetry is supported by experimental data for thin films of ZIF&#8208;8.

         <title>Engineering Nanostructure&#8211;Interface of Photoanode Materials Toward Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoanode materials with better optical response and surface/interface carrier transport/injection performance can obtain more efficienct PEC water oxidation. Various strategies for improving the PEC water oxidation performance from the perspective of nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering are summarized and the relationship between nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering and the optical&#8208;response, surficial/interfacial carrier transport/injection processes of photoanode materials are discussed.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation based on semiconductor materials plays an important role in the production of clean fuel and value&#8208;added chemicals. Nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering has proven to be an effective way to construct highly efficient PEC water oxidation photoanodes with good light capture, carrier transport, and water oxidation kinetics. However, from theoretical and application perspectives, the relationship between the nanostructure and interface of photoanode materials and their PEC performance remains unclear. In this review, the PEC water oxidation reaction mechanism and evaluation criteria are briefly presented. The theoretical basis and research status of the nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering on constructing high&#8208;performance PEC water oxidation photoanodes are summarized and discussed. Finally, the current challenges and the future opportunities of nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering for the PEC reactions are pointed out.

         <title>Diffusive and Drift Halide Perovskite Memristive Barristors as Nociceptive and Synaptic Emulators for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskite memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing are experimentally demonstrated. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate interfaces promote diffusive kinetics while NiOx interfaces support drift kinetics with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the switching matrix, resulting in modulatable diffusive and drift memristors respectively.








Abstract
With the current research impetus on neuromorphic computing hardware, realizing efficient drift and diffusive memristors are considered critical milestones for the implementation of readout layers, selectors, and frameworks in deep learning and reservoir computing networks. Current demonstrations are predominantly limited to oxide insulators with a soft breakdown behavior. While organic ionotronic electrochemical materials offer an attractive alternative, their implementations thus far have been limited to features exploiting ionic drift a.k.a. drift memristor technology. Development of diffusive memristors with organic electrochemical materials is still at an early stage, and modulation of their switching dynamics remains unexplored. Here, halide perovskite (HP) memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. An ion permissive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate interface that promotes diffusive kinetics and an ion source nickel oxide (NiOx) interface that supports drift kinetics are identified to design diffusive and drift memristors, respectively, with methylammonuim lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as the switching matrix. In line with the recent interest on developing artificial afferent nerves as information channels bridging sensors and artificial neural networks, these HP memristive barristors are fashioned as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing.

         <title>Conformal Geometry and Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing through Freeform Transformation of Building Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing process that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation of individual build layers while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques is reported. Individually manipulating each build layer within the sequential layered manufacturing process allows digital transformation of 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly; printing of conformal geometry to ensure custom fitting of vascular scaffolds; and realization of multiaxis, multimaterials 3D printing of soft robotic actuators.








Abstract
3D printing, formally known as additive manufacturing, creates complex geometries via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer addition of materials. While 3D printing has been historically perceived as the static addition of build layers, 3D printing is now considered as a dynamic assembly process. In this context, here a new 3D printing process is reported that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation (translating, rotating, and scaling) of each individual building layer while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques. Transforming individual building layers within the sequential layered manufacturing process enables dynamic transformation of the 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, eliminating the time&#8208;consuming redesign steps. Preserving the locality of the transformation to each layer further enables the discrete conformal transformation, allowing objects such as vascular scaffolds to be optimally fabricated to properly fit within specific patient anatomy obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Finally, exploiting the freedom to control the orientation of each individual building layer, multimaterials, multiaxis 3D printing capability are further established for integrating functional modules made of dissimilar materials in 3D printed devices. This final capability is demonstrated through 3D printing a soft pneumatic gripper via heterogenous integration of rigid base and soft actuating limbs.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for In Situ Construction of Highly Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase to Enable High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>

A unique electrolyte design strategy for in situ solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) construction is proposed in aqueous Zn chemistry to stabilize the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interface. Apart from the realization of high Zn reversibility and utilization, the exploitation of the robust in situ SEI enables significantly enhanced cyclability of Zn/V2O5 full cells under practical conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries promise high capacity, low cost, high safety, and sustainability for large&#8208;scale energy storage. The Zn metal anode, however, suffers from the dendrite growth and side reactions that are mainly due to the absence of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, the in situ formation of a dense, stable, and highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI layer (hopeite) in aqueous Zn chemistry is demonstrated, by introducing Zn(H2PO4)2 salt into the electrolyte. The hopeite SEI (&#8776;140&#160;nm thickness) enables uniform and rapid Zn&#8208;ion transport kinetics for dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and restrains the side reactions via isolating active Zn from the bulk electrolyte. Under practical testing conditions with an ultrathin Zn anode (10&#160;&#181;m), a low negative/positive capacity ratio (&#8776;2.3), and a lean electrolyte (9&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), the Zn/V2O5 full cell retains 94.4% of its original capacity after 500 cycles. This work provides a simple yet practical solution to high&#8208;performance aqueous battery technology via building in situ SEI layers.

         <title>Sequential Coevaporation and Deposition of Antimony Selenosulfide Thin Film for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential coevaporation technique of Sb2Se3 and sulfur powders is developed for the deposition of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) thin film, from which it is discovered that the interfacial properties, source&#8211;substrate distance, and temperature of the substrate conjugatedly affect the structural and electrical properties. The corresponding device delivers a champion efficiency of 8.0% in the vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived alloy&#8208;type Sb2(S,Se)3 films.








Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is an emerging low&#8208;cost, nontoxic solar material with suitable bandgap and high absorption coefficient. Developing effective methods for fabricating high&#8208;quality films would benefit the device efficiency improvement and deepen the fundamental understanding on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, equipment is developed that allows online introduction of precursor vapor during the reaction process, enabling sequential coevaporation of Sb2Se3 and S powders for the deposition of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films. With this unique ability, it is revealed that the deposition sequence manipulates both the interfacial properties and optoelectronic properties of the absorber film. A power conversion efficiency of 8.0% is achieved, which is the largest value in vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. The research demonstrates that multi&#8208;source sequential coevaporation is an efficient technique to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Growth Regulation Enables Sensitive Broadband Detection and Imaging of Polarized Photons Covering 300&#8211;1050&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization photodetectors with solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA=methylammonium) polycrystalline film as photoactive layer are designed to sensitively detect and image the polarized photons from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. Additives play an important role in regulating oriented crystal growth. This low&#8208;cost and facile fabrication process can pave the way for universal application of polarization photodetectors toward accurate target recognition in military and civilian fields.








Abstract
Photodetectors selective to the polarization empower breakthroughs in sensing technology for target identification. However, the realization of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on intrinsically anisotropic crystal structure or extrinsically anisotropic device pattern requires complicated epitaxy and etching processes, which limit scalable production and application. Here, solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA= methylammonium) polycrystalline film is probed as photoactive layer toward sensing polarized photon from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. The growth of the PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 crystal occurs in confined crystallographic orientation of the (202) facet upon the assistance of NH4SCN and NH4Cl, enhancing anisotropic photoelectric properties. Therefore, the photodetector achieves a polarization ratio of 0.41 and dichroism ratio (Imax/Imin) of 2.4 at 900&#160;nm. At 520&#160;nm, the Imax/Imin even surpasses the one of the perovskite crystalline films, 1.8 and &#8776;1.2, respectively. It is worth noting that the superior figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits possess a response width of 900&#160;kHz, Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 108, linear dynamic range from 0.15 nW to 12&#160;mW, noise current of 8.28 &#215; 10&#8722;13 A &#215; Hz&#8722;0.5, and specific detectivity of 1.53 &#215; 1012 Jones, which demonstrate high resolution and high speed for weak signal sensing and imaging. The proof of concept in polarized imaging confirms that the polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector meets the requirements for practical application in target recognition.

         <title>In Vivo Three&#8208;Photon Imaging of Lipids using Ultrabright Fluorogens with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) dots in an aqueous medium are synthesized for in vivo labeling of lipids. The ultrabright fluorescence in the far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (quantum yield of 26%) enables intravital three&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging of lipids in fatty liver and atherosclerotic plaques in brain vasculatures and carotid arteries under NIR&#8208;II laser excitation.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of in vivo lipids labeling are highly desirable for studying lipid&#8208;accumulation&#8208;related metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type&#8208;2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, most of the current lipid&#8208;specific fluorophores cannot be used for in vivo labeling due to their strong hydrophobicity. Herein, organic dots from bright luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgen) are developed for in vivo labeling and three&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging of lipid&#8208;rich tissues, such as fatty liver, atherosclerotic plaques in brain vasculatures, and carotid arteries. The organic dots show excellent stability in an aqueous medium with high targeting specificity to lipids and strong three&#8208;photon fluorescence in the far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region under NIR&#8208;II laser excitation, which enables efficient in vivo labeling and imaging of lipids in deep tissues. The study will inspire the development of lipid&#8208;targeting fluorophores for in vivo applications.

         <title>Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels with Broad&#8208;Range Tunable Mechanical Properties via the Hofmeister Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freeze&#8208;soak strategy is proposed to make hydrogels with broad&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties via the Hofmeister effect. Because of the various aggregation degrees of the polymers chains induced by the Hofmeister effect, hydrogels with ultrahigh&#8208;toughness and wide&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties can be made by changing the salt types and concentrations. Meanwhile, the mechanics of the hydrogel can be in situ tuned dynamically.








Abstract
Hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in soft robotics, tissue engineering, implantable electronics, etc., often require sophisticately tailoring of the hydrogel mechanical properties to meet specific demands. For examples, soft robotics necessitates tough hydrogels; stem cell culturing demands various tissue&#8208;matching modulus; and neuron probes desire dynamically tunable modulus. Herein, a strategy to broadly alter the mechanical properties of hydrogels reversibly via tuning the aggregation states of the polymer chains by ions based on the Hofmeister effect is reported. An ultratough poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as an exemplary material (toughness 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which surpasses synthetic polymers like poly(dimethylsiloxane), synthetic rubber, and natural spider silk is fabricated. With various ions, the hydrogel's various mechanical properties are continuously and reversibly in situ modulated over a large window: tensile strength from 50 &#177; 9&#160;kPa to 15 &#177; 1&#160;MPa, toughness from 0.0167&#160;&#177; 0.003 to 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, elongation from 300&#160;&#177; 100% to 2100&#160;&#177; 300%, and modulus from 24 &#177; 2 to 2500 &#177; 140&#160;kPa. Importantly, the ions serve as gelation triggers and property modulators only, not necessarily required to remain in the gel, maintaining the high biocompatibility of PVA without excess ions. This strategy, enabling high mechanical performance and broad dynamic tunability, presents a universal platform for broad applications from biomedicine to wearable electronics.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled, Scalable Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH Nanosheet Arrays on Nickel Foam toward Efficient Oxygen Evolution: The Key Role of In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Generated &#947;&#8208;NiOOH</title>

         <dc:description>
The controllable and scalable synthesis of &#947;&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide (&#947;&#8208;FeOOH) nanosheets arrays (NAs) on diverse substrates is achieved via one&#8208;step hydrolysis of K2FeO4 in NaOH solution under ambient conditions, where NaOH decides the hydrolysis pathway and kinetics of K2FeO4. Benefiting from the optimized nanostructure and electrooxidation&#8208;generated &#947;&#8208;NiOOH, the &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs on nickel foam system exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Layered &#947;&#8208;type iron oxyhydroxide (&#947;&#8208;FeOOH) is a promising material for various applications; however, its sheet&#8208;shaped structure often suffers from instability that results in aggregation and leads to inferior performance. Herein, a kinetically controlled hydrolysis strategy is proposed for the scalable synthesis of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH nanosheets arrays (NAs) with enhanced structural stability on diverse substrates at ambient conditions. The underlying mechanisms for the growth of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs associated with their structural evolution are systematically elucidated by alkalinity&#8208;controlled synthesis and time&#8208;dependent experiments. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs are developed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the sample grown on nickel foam (NF) exhibits superior performance of high catalytic current density, small Tafel slope, and exceptional durability, which is among the top level of FeOOH&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that &#947;&#8208;NiOOH in situ generated from the electrooxidation of NF would induce charge accumulation on the Fe sites of &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs, leading to enhanced OER intermediates adsorption for water splitting. This work affords a new technique to rationally design and synthesize &#947;&#8208;FeOOH NAs for various applications.

         <title>Electronic States Modulation by Coherent Optical Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The&#160;modulation of the excitonic properties of 2D perovskites by coherent optical phonons is investigated using comprehensive optical spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. A clear understanding of these phonon modulation mechanisms injects fresh insights into the exciton&#8211;phonon coupling in 2D perovskites, which may help unlock new optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Excitonic effects underpin the fascinating optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites that are highly favorable for photovoltaics and light&#8208;emitting devices. Analogous to switching in transistors, manipulating these excitonic properties in 2D perovskites using coherent phonons could unlock new applications. Presently, a detailed understanding of this underlying mechanism remains modest. Herein, the origins of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in 2D perovskites using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy are explicated. The exciton fine structure is modulated by coherent optical phonons dominated by the vibrational motion of the PbI6 octahedra via deformation potential. Originating from impulsive stimulated Raman scattering, these coherent vibrations manifest as oscillations in the TA spectrum comprising of the generation and detection processes of coherent phonons. This two&#8208;step process leads to a unique pump&#8208; and probe&#8208;energy dependence of the phonon modulation determined by the imaginary part of the refractive index and its derivative, respectively. The phonon frequency and lattice displacement of the inorganic octahedra are highly dependent on the organic cation. This study injects fresh insights into the exciton&#8211;phonon coupling of 2D perovskites relevant for emergent optoelectronics development.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Zn2+ Ion Flux and Desolvation Effect Enabled by Anodic Growth of a 3D ZnF2 Matrix for Long&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) is prepared through a simple and fast electrochemical anodic growth method. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the intrinsic high volumetric capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the low Coulombic efficiency and limited lifespan of Zn metal anodes resulting from uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites impede their practical application. In this work, a 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix is designed on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) through a simple and fast anodic growth method, serving as a multifunctional protective layer. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics. The results reveal that the Zn@ZnF2 electrode can effectively inhibit dendrites growth, restrain the hydrogen evolution reactions, and endow excellent plating/stripping reversibility. Accordingly, the Zn@ZnF2 electrode exhibits a long cycle life of over 800 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell test, the feasibility of which is also convincing in Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 and Zn@ZnF2//V2O5 full batteries. Importantly, a hybrid zinc&#8208;ion capacitor of the Zn@ZnF2//AC can work at an ultrahigh current density of &#8776;60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for up to 5000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 92.8%.

         <title>Constructing Li&#8208;Rich Artificial SEI Layer in Alloy&#8211;Polymer Composite Electrolyte to Achieve High Ionic Conductivity for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A Li&#8208;rich artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer about 60 nm thick is successfully designed and constructed in a Li alloy filled poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolyte to achieve high ionic conductivity for lithium metal batteries. The LiFePO4|Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit high cycling performance of 111.3 mA h g&#8211;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C in 45 &#176;C.








Abstract
To achieve high ionic conductivity for solid electrolyte, an artificial Li&#8208;rich interface layer of about 60&#160;nm thick has been constructed in polymer&#8208;based poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide composite solid electrolyte (briefly noted as PEOm) by adding Li&#8208;based alloys. As revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, an artificial interface layer of amorphous feature is created around the Li&#8208;based alloy particles with the gradient distribution of Li across it. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the interface layer provides fast ion transport path and plays a key role in achieving high and stable ionic conductivity for PEOm&#8208;Li21Si5 composite solid electrolyte. The PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 composite electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.9 &#215; 10&#8211;5&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C and 5.6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#160;&#176;C. The LiFePO4 | PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 | Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries could maintain a stable capacity of 129.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 30&#160;&#176;C after 100 cycles, and 111.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 45&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability.

         <title>Stamping Flexible Li Alloy Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by an ancient topography technology, a thin (15 &#181;m) and flexible Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode is achieved with excellent electrochemical performance and good safety. A range of printed patterns on various substrates can be obtained using the stamping process. The printed Li&#8211;Sn alloy has an areal capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8211;2, which can match that of the most typical commercial cathodes.








Abstract
Li metal holds great promise to be the ultimate anode choice owing to its high specific capacity and low redox potential. However, processing Li metal into thin&#8208;film anode with high electrochemical performance and good safety to match commercial cathodes remains challenging. Herein, a new method is reported to prepare ultrathin, flexible, and high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;Sn alloy anodes with various shapes on a number of substrates by directly stamping a molten metal solution. The printed anode is as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m, corresponding to an areal capacity of &#8776;3 mAh cm&#8211;2 that matches most commercial cathode materials. The incorporation of Sn provides the nucleation center for Li, thereby mitigating Li dendrites as well as decreasing the overpotential during Li stripping/plating (e.g., &lt;10&#160;mV at 0.25&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a flexible Li&#8208;ion battery using the ultrathin Li&#8211;Sn alloy anode and a commercial NMC cathode demonstrates good electrochemical performance and reliable cell operation even after repetitive deformation. The approach can be extended to other metal/alloy anodes such as Na, K, and Mg. This study opens a new door toward the future development of high&#8208;performance ultrathin alloy&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Important Role of High&#8208;Lying Triplet&#8211;Lowest Excited Singlet Transitions in Achieving Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue AIE&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient spin transition between a high&#8208;lying excited triplet state and the lowest excited singlet state in aggregation&#8208;induced emission materials is demonstrated by magnetic field effects. A highly efficient deep&#8208;blue aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) is achieved by further regulating utilization of excitons, which shows an excellent external quantum efficiency of 10.2%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a high brightness of 16 817 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) materials are attractive for achieving highly efficient nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their strong luminescence in the solid state. However, the electroluminescence efficiency of most AIE&#8208;based OLEDs remains low owing to the waste of triplet excitons. Here, using theoretical calculations, photophysical dynamics, and magnetoluminescence measurements, the spin conversion process is demonstrated between the high&#8208;lying triplet state (Tn) and the lowest excited singlet state (S1) in AIE materials. Moreover, the relative positions of Tn (n&#160;&lt;&#160;4) and S1 are shown to have a significant impact on the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency, thus influencing the harvesting of triplet excitons and the device efficiency. Finally, by selecting an upconversion material with an appropriate energy level for further utilizing the triplet excitons, a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent OLED with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.08), a&#160;maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.2%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a high brightness of 16817&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is developed. This is one of the most efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on AIE materials reported so far. These findings also provide new insights into the design of more efficient AIE molecules and corresponding OLEDs by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.

         <title>A Multifunctional Origami Patch for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional patch presents new opportunities for sealing tissues in minimally invasive surgeries. Integration of a dynamic hydrophobic fluid layer, a microtextured bioadhesive layer, and a zwitterionic&#8208;interpenetrated elastomer layer enables the patch to withstand fluid&#8208;rich environments, maintain a robust seal, and minimize biofouling and inflammation. By employing various origami&#8208;based designs, the patch can be adapted for different clinical applications.








Abstract
For decades, bioadhesive materials have garnered great attention due to their potential to replace sutures and staples for sealing tissues during minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, the complexities of delivering bioadhesives through narrow spaces and achieving strong adhesion in fluid&#8208;rich physiological environments continue to present substantial limitations to the surgical translation of existing sealants. In this work, a new strategy for minimally invasive tissue sealing based on a multilayer bioadhesive patch, which is designed to repel body fluids, to form fast, pressure&#8208;triggered adhesion with wet tissues, and to resist biofouling and inflammation is introduced. The multifunctional patch is realized by a synergistic combination of three distinct functional layers: i) a microtextured bioadhesive layer, ii) a dynamic, blood&#8208;repellent hydrophobic fluid layer, and iii) an antifouling zwitterionic nonadhesive layer. The patch is capable of forming robust adhesion to tissue surfaces in the presence of blood, and exhibits superior resistance to bacterial adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, and in vivo fibrous capsule formation. By adopting origami&#8208;based fabrication strategies, it is demonstrated that the patch can be readily integrated with a variety of minimally invasive end effectors to provide facile tissue sealing in ex vivo porcine models, offering new opportunities for minimally invasive tissue sealing in diverse clinical scenarios.

In this work, a new strategy for minimally invasive tissue sealing based on a multilayer bioadhesive patch, which is designed to repel body fluids, to form fast, pressure&#8208;triggered adhesion with wet tissues, and to resist biofouling and inflammation is introduced. The multifunctional patch is realized by a synergistic combination of three distinct functional layers: i) a microtextured bioadhesive layer, ii) a dynamic, blood&#8208;repellent hydrophobic fluid layer, and iii) an antifouling zwitterionic nonadhesive layer. The patch is capable of forming robust adhesion to tissue surfaces in the presence of blood, and exhibits superior resistance to bacterial adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, and in vivo fibrous capsule formation. By adopting origami&#8208;based fabrication strategies, it is demonstrated that the patch can be readily integrated with a variety of minimally invasive end effectors to provide facile tissue sealing in ex vivo porcine models, offering new opportunities for minimally invasive tissue sealing in diverse clinical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Mechanically Robust and Versatile Liquid&#8208;Free Ionic Conductive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel liquid&#8208;free ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) that possesses excellent mechanical properties and overcomes some of the intrinsic shortcomings of gel&#8208;based ionic conductors, for example leakage and evaporation, is designed. A series of ICE&#8208;based liquid&#8208;free ionotronic devices, including resistive sensors, ionic skins, and triboelectric nanogenerators, is presented. The processability of the material is further demonstrated via 3D printing.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, such as hydrogels and ionogels, have enabled stretchable and transparent ionotronics, but they suffer from key limitations inherent to the liquid components, which may leak and evaporate. Here, novel liquid&#8208;free ionic conductive elastomers (ICE) that are copolymer networks hosting lithium cations and associated anions via lithium bonds and hydrogen bonds are demonstrated, such that they are intrinsically immune from leakage and evaporation. The ICEs show extraordinary mechanical versatility including excellent stretchability, high strength and toughness, self&#8208;healing, quick self&#8208;recovery, and 3D&#8208;printability. More intriguingly, the ICEs can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness&#8212;a compromise well recognized in mechanics and material science&#8212;and simultaneously overcome the conflict between ionic conductivity and mechanical properties, which is common for ionogels. Several liquid&#8208;free ionotronics based on the ICE are further developed, including resistive force sensors, multifunctional ionic skins, and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which are not subject to limitations of previous gel&#8208;based devices, such as leakage, evaporation, and weak hydrogel&#8211;elastomer interfaces. Also, the 3D printability of the ICEs is demonstrated by printing a series of structures with fine features. The findings offer promise for a variety of ionotronics requiring environmental stability and durability.

         <title>Translocation of DNA through Ultrathin Nanoslits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, is studied, and the DNA polymer behavior in this tight confinement is examined. DNA molecules, including folds and knots, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions with the confining graphene surfaces.








Abstract
2D nanoslit devices, where two crystals with atomically flat surfaces are separated by only a few nanometers, have attracted considerable attention because their tunable control over the confinement allows for the discovery of unusual transport behavior of gas, water, and ions. Here, the passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules is studied through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, and the DNA polymer behavior is examined in this tight confinement. Two types of events are observed in the ionic current: long current blockades that signal DNA translocation and short spikes where DNA enters the slits but withdraws. DNA translocation events exhibit three distinct phases in their current&#8208;blockade traces&#8212;loading, translation, and exit. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation allows the different polymer configurations of these phases to be identified. DNA molecules, including folds and knots in their polymer structure, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions of DNA with the confining graphene surfaces. It is anticipated that this new class of 2D&#8208;nanoslit devices will provide unique ways to study polymer physics and enable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip biotechnology.

         <title>Electrically Insulating Flexible Films with Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Fillers as Efficient Electromagnetic Shields in the GHz and Sub&#8208;THz Frequency Bands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer composite films with fillers of exfoliated quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials are described. Such composites with low loadings of TaSe3 reveal excellent electromagnetic shielding in the GHz and sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining electrically insulating. These novel films are promising for communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and insulating.








Abstract
Polymer composite films containing fillers comprising quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials, specifically transition metal trichalcogenides with 1D&#160;structural motifs that enable their exfoliation into bundles of atomic threads, are reported. These nanostructures are characterized by extremely large aspect ratios of up to &#8776;106. The polymer composites with low loadings of quasi&#8208;1D TaSe3 fillers (&lt;3&#160;vol%) reveal excellent electromagnetic interference shielding in the X&#8208;band GHz and extremely high frequency sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining DC electrically insulating. The unique electromagnetic shielding characteristics of these films are attributed to effective coupling of the electromagnetic waves to the high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio electrically conductive TaSe3 atomic&#8208;thread bundles even when the filler concentration is below the electrical percolation threshold. These novel films are promising for high&#8208;frequency communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and electrically insulating.

         <title>Guided Mid&#8208;IR and Near&#8208;IR Light within a Hybrid Hyperbolic&#8208;Material/Silicon Waveguide Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid platform composed of a hexagonal boron nitride slab and silicon waveguide enables guiding at both mid&#8208;infrared and near&#8208;infrared simultaneously. Theoretical calculations and infrared nanoimaging are applied to study the guided mid&#8208;infrared hyperbolic polaritons. The performance in the near&#8208;infrared is verified via transmission measurements and simulations. This demonstrates an approach to integrate hyperbolic media with silicon photonics.








Abstract
Silicon waveguides have enabled large&#8208;scale manipulation and processing of near&#8208;infrared optical signals on chip. Yet, expanding the bandwidth of guided waves to other frequencies will further increase the functionality of silicon as a photonics platform. Frequency multiplexing by integrating additional architectures is one approach to the problem, but this is challenging to design and integrate within the existing form factor due to scaling with the free&#8208;space wavelength. This paper demonstrates that a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/silicon hybrid waveguide can simultaneously enable dual&#8208;band operation at both mid&#8208;infrared (6.5&#8211;7.0&#160;&#181;m) and telecom (1.55&#160;&#181;m) frequencies, respectively. The device is realized via the lithography&#8208;free transfer of hBN onto a silicon waveguide, maintaining near&#8208;infrared operation. In addition, mid&#8208;infrared waveguiding of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) supported in hBN is induced by the index contrast between the silicon waveguide and the surrounding air underneath the hBN, thereby eliminating the need for deleterious etching of the hyperbolic medium. The behavior of HPhP waveguiding in both straight and curved trajectories is validated within an analytical waveguide theoretical framework. This exemplifies a generalizable approach based on integrating hyperbolic media with silicon photonics for realizing frequency multiplexing in on&#8208;chip photonic systems.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Cholesterol&#8208;Decorated DNA Nanoflowers for Intracellular Ratiometric Aptasensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite (DNA nanoflower) intracellular aptasensor with sequence&#8208;encoded multifunctional features is realized by implementing enzymatic amplification&#8208;driven biomimetic crystallization. This platform is capable of ratiometric and quantitative intracellular detection upon targeted delivery and holds substantial promise as strategically self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosensors for interrogating cellular analytes whose changes in abundance are explained as a continuous function.








Abstract
Probing endogenous molecular profiles is of fundamental importance to understand cellular function and processes. Despite the promise of programmable nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based aptasensors across the breadth of biomolecular detection, target&#8208;responsive aptasensors enabling intracellular detection are as of yet infrequently realized. Several challenges remain, including the difficulties in quantification/normalization of quencher&#8208;based intensiometric signals, stability issues of the probe architecture, and complex sensor operations often necessitating extensive structural modeling. Here, the biomimetic crystallization&#8208;empowered self&#8208;assembly of a tumor&#8208;targetable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite aptasensor is presented, which enables F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based quantitative interpretation of changes in the cellular target abundance. Leveraging the design programmability and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of rolling circle amplification&#8208;driven DNA nanoarchitecture, this designer platform offers a method to self&#8208;assemble a robust nanosensor from a multifunctionality&#8208;encoded template that includes a cell&#8208;targeting aptamer, a ratiometric aptasensor, and a cholesterol&#8208;decorating element. Taking prostate cancer cells and intracellular adenosine triphosphate molecules as a model system, a synergistic effect in the targeted delivery by cholesterol and aptamers, and the feasibility of quantitative intracellular aptasensing are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this approach provides a highly generalizable strategy across wide&#8208;ranging target systems toward a biologically deliverable nanosensor that enables quantitative monitoring of the abundance of endogenous biomolecules.

         <title>Hybrid Waveguides: Guided Mid&#8208;IR and Near&#8208;IR Light within a Hybrid Hyperbolic&#8208;Material/Silicon Waveguide Heterostructure (Adv. Mater. 11/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated silicon photonics works in the near&#8208;infrared with bandwidth limited to the number of channels that can physically fit within a given chip. In article number 2004305, Joshua D. Caldwell and co&#8208;workers report a hybrid heterostructure system composed of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab on top of a silicon waveguide to realize multiplexing of both near&#8208; and mid&#8208;infrared signals. The sub&#8208;diffractional hyperbolic polaritons supported in hBN are guided by the underlying silicon structure, propagating with, but not influencing, the near&#8208;IR signal.

         <title>Bioadhesives: A Multifunctional Origami Patch for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sealing (Adv. Mater. 11/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2007667, Hyunwoo Yuk, Xuanhe Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report a multifunctional patch for sealing tissues in minimally invasive surgery. Integration of a dynamic fluid layer, a microtextured bioadhesive, and a zwitterionic&#8208;interpenetrated elastomer enables the patch to be applied amid body fluids, form robust adhesion, and resist fouling. Amenable to origami&#8208;based designs, the patch can be deployed using a variety of minimally invasive surgical tools.

         <title>3D Printing: Conformal Geometry and Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing through Freeform Transformation of Building Layers (Adv. Mater. 11/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005672, Cheng Sun and co&#8208;workers report a new additive manufacturing process that unleashes the full six degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom in transforming and assembling each of the building layers into the final geometry. It not only enables discrete conformal transformation, allowing 3D&#8208;printed biomedical implants to be customized for specific patient anatomy, but more importantly, also establishes multimaterial, multi&#8208;axis 3D&#8208;printing capability for integrating functional modules made of dissimilar materials in 3D&#8208;printed devices.

         <title>Nonlinear Photonics Using Low&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites: Recent Advances and Future Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts. A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208; and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their widespread practical applications, is provided.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited significantly superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts, thanks to their peculiar physical and electronic structures. Their exceptional nonlinear optical characteristics make them excellent candidates for revolutionizing widespread applications. However, the research of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites is in its infancy. There is a lack of comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of this research realm. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208;and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their practical applications, is summarized comprehensively. Critical discussions are offered on the&#160;fundamental mechanisms beneath their exceptional nonlinear optical performance&#160;from the physics viewpoint, attempting to disclose the role of intrinsic attributes (e.g., composition, bandgap, size, shape, and structure) and external modulation strategies (e.g., developing core&#8211;shell structures, transition metal ion doping, and hybridization with dielectric microspheres) in tuning the response. Additionally, their potential applications in nonlinear photonics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and biophotonics are systematically and thoroughly summed up and categorized. Lastly, insights into the current technical challenges and future research opportunities of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites are provided.

         <title>Progress in Epitaxial Thin&#8208;Film Na3Bi as a Topological Electronic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3Bi displays remarkable thickness&#8208;dependent properties, from bulk topological Dirac semimetal to wide&#8208;bandgap 2D topological insulator in ultrathin films with electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological switching. An overview of the recent progress on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area epitaxial films, and an outlook toward challenges and opportunities for applications to the next generation of topological electronic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Trisodium bismuthide (Na3Bi) is the first experimentally verified topological Dirac semimetal, and is a 3D analogue of graphene hosting relativistic Dirac fermions. Its unconventional momentum&#8211;energy relationship is interesting from a fundamental perspective, yielding exciting physical properties such as chiral charge carriers, the chiral anomaly, and weak anti&#8208;localization. It also shows promise for realizing topological electronic devices such as topological transistors. Herein, an overview of the substantial progress achieved in the last few years on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy. Key theoretical aspects underpinning the unique electronic properties of Na3Bi are introduced. Next, the growth process on different substrates is reviewed. Spectroscopic and microscopic features are illustrated, and an analysis of semiclassical and quantum transport phenomena in different doping regimes is provided. The emergent properties arising from confinement in two dimensions, including thickness&#8208;dependent and electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological phase transitions, are addressed, with an outlook toward current challenges and expected future progress.

         <title>Integrating Computational and Experimental Workflows for Accelerated Organic Materials Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discussion of the power of integrating computational and experimental materials discovery programmes for organic material discovery is provided, including the use of artificial intelligence techniques and automation. An overview of the different situations where combined approaches are effective is given, along with a series of case studies demonstrating recent successes.








Abstract
Organic materials find application in a range of areas, including optoelectronics, sensing, encapsulation, molecular separations, and photocatalysis. The discovery of materials is frustratingly slow however, particularly when contrasted to the vast chemical space of possibilities based on the near limitless options for organic molecular precursors. The difficulty in predicting the material assembly, and consequent properties, of any molecule is another significant roadblock to targeted materials design. There has been significant progress in the development of computational approaches to screen large numbers of materials, for both their structure and properties, helping guide synthetic researchers toward promising materials. In particular, artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to make significant impact in many elements of the discovery process. Alongside this, automation and robotics are increasing the scale and speed with which materials synthesis can be realized. Herein, the focus is on demonstrating the power of integrating computational and experimental materials discovery programmes, including both a summary of key situations where approaches can be combined and a series of case studies that demonstrate recent successes.

         <title>Recent Progress on Nanocellulose Aerogels: Preparation, Modification, Composite Fabrication, Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocellulose aerogels are summarized in terms of their preparation methods, modification strategies, properties, and their inclusion in composites with various other compounds. Their applications with recent advancements in various fields are also presented. Finally, some conclusions and brief future prospects regarding nanocellulose aerogels are discussed.








Abstract
The rapid development of modern industry and excessive consumption of petroleum&#8208;based polymers have triggered a double crisis presenting a shortage of nonrenewable resources and environmental pollution. However, this has provided an opportunity to stimulate researchers to harness native biobased materials for novel advanced materials and applications. Nanocellulose&#8208;based aerogels, using abundant and sustainable cellulose as raw material, present a third&#8208;generation of aerogels that combine traditional aerogels with high porosity and large specific surface area, as well as the excellent properties of cellulose itself. Currently, nanocellulose aerogels provide a highly attention&#8208;catching platform for a wide range of functional applications in various fields, e.g., adsorption, separation, energy storage, thermal insulation, electromagnetic interference shielding, and biomedical applications. Here, the preparation methods, modification strategies, composite fabrications, and further applications of nanocellulose aerogels are summarized, with additional discussions regarding the prospects and potential challenges in future development.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Soft Sensors: From Material Design to Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of self&#8208;healing soft sensing platforms is presented and discussed, while pointing out pathways to be followed by materials designers, synthetic chemists, and engineers for developing further high&#8208;performance and durable sensing devices.








Abstract
The demand for interfacing electronics in everyday life is rapidly accelerating, with an ever&#8208;growing number of applications in wearable electronics and electronic skins for robotics, prosthetics, and other purposes. Soft sensors that efficiently detect environmental or biological/physiological stimuli have been extensively studied due to their essential role in creating the necessary interfaces for these applications. Unfortunately, due to their natural softness, these sensors are highly sensitive to structural and mechanical damage. The integration of natural properties, such as self&#8208;healing, into these systems should improve their reliability, stability, and long&#8208;term performance. Recent studies on self&#8208;healing soft sensors for varying chemical and physical parameters are herein reviewed. In addition, contemporary studies on material design, device structure, and fabrication methods for sensing platforms are also discussed. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives in this field are introduced, while focusing on the most promising examples and directions already reported.

         <title>General Programmable Growth of Hybrid Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures with Liquid Metal Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general programmable strategy to fabricate core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal nanodroplets as reformable core templates is demonstrated, offering a route to producing nanostructures with multiple, complex, and desired structures, compositions, and sizes on a large scale.








Abstract
Core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures have been receiving significant interest due to their potential in wide scientific and technological fields. Given such large scope, however, they still lag far behind in terms of the ambition toward controllably, or even programmatically, synthesizing libraries of core&#8211;shell structures on a large scale. Here, a general route for the programmable preparation of complex core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal (LM) droplets as reformable templates is presented, and the triggering of a localized galvanic replacement reaction in one ultrasonication system is demonstrated. Benefiting from the activity and mobility of the metal components in LM templates, high&#8208;level compositional diversity control and quantitative regulation of both the core and the shell layers of the heterogeneous products are achieved, which cannot be realized with a solid&#8208;template synthetic route.

         <title>Interfacial Atomistic Mechanisms of Lithium Metal Stripping and Plating in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery is a key research direction for next&#8208;generation batteries. Using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the detailed atomistic mechanism and interface failure of the lithium metal anode during lithium cycling are revealed. A guiding map and new strategies for the selection and improvement of solid interfaces in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are provided.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries based on a Li metal anode represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage system, but are currently limited by low current density and short cycle life. Further research to improve the Li metal anode is impeded by the lack of understanding in its failure mechanisms at lithium&#8211;solid interfaces, in particular, the fundamental atomistic processes responsible for interface failure. Here, using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the first atomistic modeling study of lithium stripping and plating on a solid electrolyte is performed by explicitly considering key fundamental atomistic processes and interface atomistic structures. In the simulations, the interface failure initiated with the formation of nano&#8208;sized pores, and how interface structures, lithium diffusion, adhesion energy, and applied pressure affect interface failure during Li cycling are observed. By systematically varying the parameters of solid&#8208;state lithium cells in the simulations, the parameter space of applied pressures and interfacial adhesion energies that inhibit interface failure during cycling are mapped to guide selection of solid&#8208;state cells. This study establishes the atomistic modeling for Li stripping and plating, and predicts optimal solid interfaces and new strategies for the future research and development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Control of Double Exchange Interaction in La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 for Ionic&#8211;Electric&#8211;Magnetic Coupled Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;incorporating La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 shows a reversible metal&#8211;insulator transition with tailored ferromagnetism owing to a modulation of the double exchange interaction. High reproducibility, long&#8208;term stability, and linear multilevel resistivity and magnetic moment are demonstrated, which are attractive for ionic&#8211;electric&#8211;magnetic coupled applications.








Abstract
The dynamic tuning of ion concentrations has attracted significant attention for creating versatile functionalities of materials, which are impossible to reach using classical control knobs. Despite these merits, the following fundamental questions remain: how do ions affect the electronic bandstructure, and how do ions simultaneously change the electrical and magnetic properties? Here, by annealing platinum&#8208;dotted La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 films in hydrogen and argon at a lower temperature of 200 &#176;C for several minutes, a reversible change in resistivity is achieved by three orders of magnitude with tailored ferromagnetic magnetization. The transition occurs through the tuning of the double exchange interaction, ascribed to an electron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced and/or a lattice&#8208;expansion&#8208;induced modulation, along with an increase in the hydrogen concentration. High reproducibility, long&#8208;term stability, and multilevel linearity are appealing for ionic&#8211;electric&#8211;magnetic coupled applications.

The intrinsic formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during hydrogenation of suitably designed Mg nanoparticles is demonstrated. A formation mechanism is proposed and the primary degradation mechanism of the nanoparticles based on transmission electron microscopy is identified. The combined knowledge of both mechanisms is expected to enable cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based materials for dynamic plasmonics and hydrogen storage, as &#947;&#8208;MgH2 enhances dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen uptake and the metal/dielectric transition make the Mg/MgH2 system a prime candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage and dynamic plasmonics. However, high dehydrogenation temperatures and slow dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2. A nanoparticle (NP) design, where &#947;&#8208;MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of &#946;&#8208;MgH2 via (301)&#946; twinning. It is proposed that these twins nucleate &#947;&#8208;MgH2 nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen&#8208;storage materials with improved dehydrogenation. It is envisioned that a more general design of confined NPs utilizes the inherent volume expansion to reform &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during each rehydrogenation.

         <title>Remote Control of Time&#8208;Regulated Stretching of Ligand&#8208;Presenting Nanocoils In Situ Regulates the Cyclic Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials allowing unprecedented, remote, and cytocompatible control of in situ and time&#8208;regulated nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils, that independently modulate the ligand pitch in the  nanocoils, are presented. It is demonstrated that magnetic control of ligand nanostretching promotes cyclic adhesion and mechanotransduction of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitates their consequential differentiation.








Abstract
Native extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit cyclic nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligands to regulate complex cell&#8211;material interactions. Designing materials that allow cyclic control of changes in intrinsic ligand&#8208;presenting nanostructures in situ can emulate ECM dynamicity to regulate cellular adhesion. Unprecedented remote control of rapid, cyclic, and mechanical stretching (&#8220;ON&#8221;) and shrinking (&#8220;OFF&#8221;) of cell&#8208;adhesive RGD ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils on a material surface in five repeated cycles are reported, thereby independently increasing and decreasing ligand pitch in nanocoils, respectively, without modulating ligand&#8208;presenting surface area per nanocoil. It is demonstrated that cyclic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (ligand nanostretching) facilitates time&#8208;regulated integrin ligation, focal adhesion, spreading, YAP/TAZ mechanosensing, and differentiation of viable stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging reveals magnetic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (stretching) and &#8220;OFF&#8221; (shrinking) of the nanocoils inside animals. Versatile tuning of physical dimensions and elements of nanocoils by regulating electrodeposition conditions is also demonstrated. The study sheds novel insight into designing materials with connected ligand nanostructures that exhibit nanocoil&#8208;specific nano&#8208;spaced declustering, which is ineffective in nanowires, to facilitate cell adhesion. This unprecedented, independent, remote, and cytocompatible control of ligand nanopitch is promising for regulating the mechanosensing&#8208;mediated differentiation of stem cells in vivo.

         <title>Extreme&#8208;Angle Silicon Infrared Optics Enabled by Streamlined Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 11, March 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralarge field of view (178&#176;) diffraction&#8208;limited imaging is experimentally realized using only a single&#8208;chip planar element composed of silicon streamlined structures, with diffraction efficiency approaching 100% even at glancing incidence. These results are attributed to the isophase streamline optimization strategy for constructing streamlined structures with the ability of perfect wavefront generation and beyond the limit of insufficient phase sampling.








Abstract
Infrared optical systems are indispensable in almost all domains of society, but their performances are often restricted by bulky size, small field of view, large thermal sensitivity, high fabrication cost, etc. Here, based on the concept of catenary optics, a novel isophase streamline optimization approach is leveraged to design silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible metasurfaces with broadband, wide&#8208;angle, and high&#8208;efficiency performances, which breaks through the glass ceiling of traditional optical technologies. By using the truly local geometric phase, a maximum diffraction efficiency approaching 100% is obtained in ultrawide spectral and angular ranges. Somewhat surprising results are shown in that wide&#8208;angle diffraction&#8208;limited imaging and laser beam steering can be realized with a record field of view up to 178&#176;. This methodology is scalable to the entire optical band and other materials, enabling unprecedented compact infrared systems for surveillance, unmanned vehicles, medical science, etc.

Transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, are reviewed in detail and the stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and possible strategies for using stacking engineering to tune the properties of 2D materials are outlined.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer blocks to form a 3D stack, with a precisely chosen sequence/angle, is the newest development for these materials. In this way, one can create &#8220;van der Waals heterostructures (HSs),&#8221; opening up a new realm of materials engineering and novel devices with designed functionalities. Herein, a detailed systematic review of transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, and stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors is presented.

         <title>Programmable Design and Performance of Modular Magnetic Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic micromodules of customized shape and position assemble to form flexible microswimmers. Through educated design, swimming speed is optimized and the study of flocks of swimmers reveals new interactions between co&#8208;moving magnetic beaters at the low Reynolds number limit.








Abstract
Synthetic biomimetic microswimmers are promising agents for in vivo healthcare and important frameworks to advance the understanding of locomotion strategies and collective motion at the microscopic scale. Nevertheless, constructing these devices with design flexibility and in large numbers remains a challenge. Here, a step toward meeting this challenge is taken by assembling such swimmers via the programmed shape and arrangement of superparamagnetic micromodules. The method's capacity for design flexibility is demonstrated through the assembly of a variety of swimmer architectures. On their actuation, strokes characterized by a balance of viscous and magnetic forces are found in all cases, but swimmers formed from a series of size&#8208;graded triangular modules swim quicker than more traditional designs comprising a circular &#8220;head&#8221; and a slender tail. Linking performance to design, rules are extracted informing the construction of a second&#8208;generation swimmer with a short tail and an elongated head optimized for speed. Its fast locomotion is attributed to a stroke that better breaks beating symmetry and an ability to beat fully with flex at high frequencies. Finally, production at scale is demonstrated through the assembly and swimming of a flock of the triangle&#8208;based architectures to reveal four types of swimmer couplings.

Abstract
Monitoring of the human microbiome is an emerging area of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Here, the potential of different nanomaterials and nanobiosensing technologies is reviewed for the development of novel diagnostic devices for the detection and measurement of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. Moreover, the current and future landscape of microbiome&#8208;based diagnostics is defined by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of current nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches, especially in the context of developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices that would meet the international guidelines known as REASSURED (Real&#8208;time connectivity; Ease of specimen collection; Affordability; Sensitivity; Specificity; User&#8208;friendliness; Rapid &amp; robust operation; Equipment&#8208;free; and Deliverability). Finally, the strategies of the latest international scientific consortia working in this field are analyzed, the current microbiome diagnostics market are reported and the principal ethical, legal, and societal issues related to microbiome R&amp;D and innovation are discussed.

         <title>In Vitro Mineralization of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vitro mineralization of collagen deals with the mechanisms of bone formation and the synthesis of tissue engineering scaffolds. Due to their biological relevance, the extra&#8208; and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. A general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed.








Abstract
Collagen mineralization is a biological process in many skeletal elements in the animal kingdom. Examples of these collagen&#8208;based skeletons are the siliceous spicules of glass sponges or the intrafibrillar hydroxyapatite platelets in vertebrates. The mineralization of collagen in vitro has gained interest for two reasons: understanding the processes behind bone formation and the synthesis of scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this paper, the efforts toward collagen mineralization in vitro are reviewed. First, general introduction toward collagen type I, the main component of the extracellular matrix in animals, is provided, followed by a brief overview of collagenous skeletons. Then, the in vitro mineralization of collagen is critically reviewed. Due to their biological abundance, hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. To a much lesser extent, also some efforts with other minerals are outlined. Combining all minerals and the suggested mechanisms for each mineral, a general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed. This review concludes with an outlook for further improvement of collagen&#8208;based tissue engineering scaffolds.

         <title>Reverse&#8208;Engineering Strain in Nanocrystallites by Tracking Trimerons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking the orbital molecule formation through the Verwey transition temperature (TV) in nanorods provides a unique window into nanocrystallite strain. Particles with uniaxial tensile strain show the highest TV = 150&#160;K reported to date.








Abstract
Although strain underpins the behavior of many transition&#8208;oxide&#8208;based magnetic nanomaterials, it is elusive to quantify. Since the formation of orbital molecules is sensitive to strain, a metal&#8211;insulator transition should be a window into nanocrystallite strain. Using three sizes of differently strained Fe3O4 polycrystalline nanorods, the impact of strain on the Verwey transition and the associated formation and dissolution processes of quasiparticle trimerons is tracked. In 40 and 50&#160;nm long nanorods, increasing isotropic strain results in Verwey transitions going from TV &#8776; 60 K to 20&#160;K. By contrast, 700&#160;nm long nanorods with uniaxial strain along the (110) direction have TV &#8776; 150&#160;K&#8212;the highest value reported thus far. A metal&#8211;insulator transition, like TV in Fe3O4, can be used to determine the effective strain within nanocrystallites, thus providing new insights into nanoparticle properties and nanomagnetism.

         <title>Thermoregulating Separators Based on Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally self&#8208;regulating separators are designed and fabricated to enhance the safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) through a nanoscale incorporation route, whereby a phase&#8208;change material capable of thermal storage is encapsulated coaxially into polymeric nanofibers. Such an unusual separator can alleviate the internal heat accumulation and temperature rise inside LIBs even under abuse conditions.








Abstract
Safety issues in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have aroused great interest owing to their wide applications, from miniaturized devices to large&#8208;scale storage plants. Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of LIBs; they prevent direct electric contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ion transport. In this study, the first design is reported for a thermoregulating separator that responds to heat stimuli. The separator with a phase&#8208;change material (PCM) of paraffin wax encapsulated in hollow polyacrylonitrile nanofibers renders a wide range of enthalpy (0&#8211;135.3 J g&#8722;1), capable of alleviating the internal temperature rise of LIBs in a timely manner. Under abuse conditions, the generated heat in batteries stimulates the melting of the encapsulated PCM, which absorbs large amounts of heat without creating a significant rise in temperature. Experimental simulation of the inner short&#8208;circuit in prototype pouch cells through nail penetration demonstrates that the PCM&#8208;based separator can effectively suppress the temperature rise due to cell failure. Meanwhile, a cell penetrated by a nail promptly cools down to room temperature within 35 s, benefiting from the latent heat&#8208;storage of the unique PCM separator. The present design of separators featuring latent heat&#8208;storage provides effective strategies for overheat protection and enhanced safety of LIBs.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Incorporated Alloy Catalysts: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth alloys are emerging catalytic materials in the field of energy conversion. They have unique electronic structures and spatial characteristics. The families of all rare earth alloy catalytic materials are reviewed, focusing on their synthesis, properties, structure, and applications.








Abstract
To improve the performance of metallic catalysts, alloying provides an efficient methodology to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. As emerging functional materials, rare&#8208;earth metal compounds can integrate the unique orbital structure and catalytic behavior of rare earth elements into metallic materials. Such rare&#8208;earth containing alloy catalysts proffer an opportunity to tailor electronic properties, tune charged carrier transport, and synergize surface reactivity, which are expected to significantly improve the performance and stability of catalysis. Despite its significance, there are only few reviews on rare earth containing alloys or related topics. This review summarizes the composition, synthesis, and applications of rare earth containing alloys in the field of catalysis. Subsequent to comprehensively summarizing and constructively discussing the existing work, the challenges and possibilities of future research on rare&#8208;earth metal compound materials are evaluated.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Colors from Carbon Dots for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) change from orange to green is realized for the first time in carbon dots (CDs) for advanced dynamic information encryption. The TDPC arises from the dual phosphorescence centers of the CDs having different decay rates, which can be simultaneously activated by irradiating with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm).








Abstract
The development of phosphorescent materials with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPCs) is of considerable interest for application in advanced dynamic information encryption. In this study, TDPC is realized in carbon dots (CDs) synthesized by the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal treatment of levofloxacin. CD ink printed on paper (CD@paper) exhibits a change in phosphorescence color from orange to green, 1 s after irradiation with 395 nm light. However, when irradiated with wavelengths shorter or longer than 395 nm, the CD@paper exhibits only green or red phosphorescence, respectively. The red and green phosphorescence originates from the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state and high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state, respectively. When irradiated with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm wavelength), the two phosphorescent centers can be simultaneously activated, emitting red and green phosphorescence with different decay rates. The red and green phosphorescence merge into an orange phosphorescence initially, exhibiting the TDPC phenomenon. Based on the unusual phosphorescent properties of the CDs, a kind of multilevel, dynamic phosphorescence colored 3D code is designed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Graphene: A Disruptive Opportunity for COVID&#8208;19 and Future Pandemics?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present pandemic has motivated researchers with different backgrounds to fight against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Graphene&#8208;related materials present numerous benefits for new antiviral solutions. The interaction of graphene&#8208;related materials with viruses, their virucidal activity, and their possible use in antiviral coatings and sensing devices for fast and reliable detection are highlighted.








Abstract
The graphene revolution, which has taken place during the last 15 years, has represented a paradigm shift for science. The extraordinary properties possessed by this unique material have paved the road to a number of applications in materials science, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. Graphene&#8208;related materials (GRMs) are now produced in large scale and have found niche applications also in the biomedical technologies, defining new standards for drug delivery and biosensing. Such advances position GRMs as novel tools to fight against the current COVID&#8208;19 and future pandemics. In this regard, GRMs can play a major role in sensing, as an active component in antiviral surfaces or in virucidal formulations. Herein, the most promising strategies reported in the literature on the use of GRM&#8208;based materials against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and other types of viruses are showcased, with a strong focus on the impact of functionalization, deposition techniques, and integration into devices and surface coatings.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Dual&#8208;Band Nano&#8208;Electromechanical Valley&#8208;Hall Topological Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of valley&#8208;Hall topological metamaterial is experimentally demonstrated on an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical platform. Backscattering&#8208;immune transport and valley&#8208;momentum locking effect are experimentally observed in the fundamental (&#8776;60 MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120 MHz) frequency bands. These nano&#8208;electromechanical metamaterials enable very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and open the door to experimental exploration of nonlinear topological mechanics at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Suppression of undesired backscattering of very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency elastic signals has been considered as a grand challenge in integrated phononic circuits. Originating from condensed&#8208;matter physics, valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators provide an intriguing strategy to overcome this challenge. To date, phononic valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators have been demonstrated only in bulk acoustic and mechanical systems operating at relatively low frequencies. Here, an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical valley&#8208;Hall topological insulator operating in the very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency regime is experimentally realized. Valley kink states that are backscattering&#8208;immune against sharp bends and exhibit the &#8220;valley&#8208;momentum locking&#8221; effect simultaneously in the fundamental (&#8776;60&#160;MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120&#160;MHz) frequency bands are demonstrated. It is further shown that the propagation directions of these dual&#8208;band valley kink states are always locked to their valley pseudospins. The results not only enable various applications in very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and capacity, but also open the door to experimental exploration of mechanical nonlinearities, particularly those involving the fundamental and second&#8208;order frequencies, in topologically nontrivial nanostructures.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistance without Mixed Valence in a Layered Phosphide Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A change of paradigm in a technologically important phenomenon, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), is introduced. Previously, it was believed that the CMR required ferromagnetic ordering and a structural distortion. EuCd2P2 has antiferromagnetic ordering and does not have a structural distortion or mixed valence, yet it exhibits the largest CMR known in a single crystal.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetoresistive responses are the backbone of spintronic technology, magnetic sensors, and hard drives. Among them, manganese oxides with a mixed valence and a cubic perovskite structure stand out due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). A double exchange interaction underlies the CMR in manganates, whereby charge transport is enhanced when the spins on neighboring Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are parallel. Prior efforts to find different materials or mechanisms for CMR resulted in a much smaller effect. Here an enormous CMR at low temperatures in EuCd2P2 without manganese, oxygen, mixed valence, or cubic perovskite structure is shown. EuCd2P2 has a layered trigonal lattice and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 11 K. The magnitude of CMR (104%) in as&#8208;grown crystals of EuCd2P2 rivals the magnitude in optimized thin films of manganates. The magnetization, transport, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray data suggest that strong magnetic fluctuations are responsible for this phenomenon. The realization of CMR at low temperatures without heterovalency leads to a new regime for materials and technologies related to antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>Intermediate&#8208;Adduct&#8208;Assisted Growth of Stable CsPbI2Br Inorganic Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Efficiency Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br is applied to prepare high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs). (Chloromethylene)&#8208;dimethylammonium chloride as an additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to favor high&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films. Through optimizing the perovskite film, interface, and electrode type, the efficiency of the ST&#8208;PSC reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively.








Abstract
Thanks to the tunable bandgap and excellent photoelectric characteristics, perovskites have been widely used in semitransparent solar cells (ST&#8208;SCs). Most works present unsatisfactory power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) through reducing the thickness of the perovskite films because there is a trade&#8208;off between PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT). As a consequence, most PCEs are less than 12% when the AVT is higher than 20% due to the limited voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc). Herein, a strategy of intermediate adduct (IMAT) engineering is developed to improve the film quality of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br, which is a challenging issue to limit its performance of efficiency and stability. A normal n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;structured PSC based on the optimal CsPbI2Br film delivers a PCE of 16.02% with excellent stability. Furthermore, through optimizing the electrode type and interface, the ST&#8208;PSC shows a high Voc larger than 1.2&#160;V and the PCE reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an AVT of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a CsPbI2Br ST&#8208;PSC, and it outperforms most of other types of perovskites.

&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; larger than 1.2&#160;V and the PCE reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an AVT of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br ST&#8208;PSC, and it outperforms most of other types of perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning are developed to provide adaptive rigid and soft interfaces for versatile applications. Integration of graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device with a gallium platform facilitates the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of the gallium, enabling accelerated rigid&#8211;soft transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of reconfigurable personal electronics shows the potential of this approach, which can significantly enhance the versatility of electronics.








Abstract
Electronics with tunable shape and stiffness can be applied in broad range of applications because their tunability allows their use in either rigid handheld form or soft wearable form, depending on needs. Previous research has enabled such reconfigurable electronics by integrating a thermally tunable gallium&#8208;based platform with flexible/stretchable electronics. However, supercooling phenomenon caused in the freezing process of gallium impedes reliable and rapid bidirectional rigid&#8211;soft conversion, limiting the full potential of this type of &#8220;transformative&#8221; electronics. Here, materials and electronics design strategies are reported to develop a transformative system with a gallium platform capable of fast reversible mechanical switching. In this electronic system, graphene is used as a catalyst to accelerate the heterogeneous nucleation of gallium to mitigate the degree of supercooling. Additionally, a flexible thermoelectric device is integrated as a means to provide active temperature control to further reduce the time for the solid&#8211;liquid transition of gallium. Analytical and experimental results establish the fundamentals for the design and optimized operation of transformative electronics for accelerated bidirectional transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a reconfigurable system, which can convert between rigid handheld electronics and a flexible wearable biosensor, demonstrates the potential of this design approach for highly versatile electronics that can support multiple applications.

         <title>Selective Release of Different Neurotransmitters Emulated by a p&#8211;i&#8211;n Junction Synaptic Transistor for Environment&#8208;Responsive Action Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor is fabricated to emulate the reconfigurability of a biological synapse that expresses complex emotions of attraction or aversion. It enables high&#8208;accuracy pattern recognition, and controls artificial muscle to move in different directions in response to different external stimuli. These properties can be important in designing complex neuromorphic systems.








Abstract
The design of the first p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor (JST) based on n&#8208;type TiO2 film covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and with a p&#8208;type P3HT/PEO nanowire (NW) on top. Except for basic synaptic functions that can be realized by a single neurotransmitter, the electronic device emulates the multiplexed neurotransmission of different neurotransmissions, i.e., glutamate and acetylcholine, for fast switching between short&#8208; and long&#8208;term plasticity (STP and LTP). This is realized by the special p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction with hole transport in the p&#8208;type P3HT NW to form STP, and electron transport in the n&#8208;type TiO2 layer and trapped under the PMMA inversion layer to form LTP. Altering the external input induces changes of the polarity of the charge carriers in the conductive channel, promoting fast switching between STP and LTP modes. When stimulated using two parallel inputs, the response of PMMA/TiO2 emulates the synergistic effect of taste and aroma on the control of food&#8208;intake in the brain. Because of the bipolarity, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n JST has excellent reconfigurability, which importantly is attributed to simulate the plasticity of synapses and to mimic how distinct types of gustatory receptor neurons respond to different concentrations of salt. The electronic device lays the technical foundation for the realization of the future complex artificial neural networks.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with Metallic Pyrochlore Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic pyrochlore oxide electrodes are&#160;introduced to create epitaxial&#160;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Further tuning through such an epitaxial stabilization process can lead to the orthorhombic phase being stable over an even larger thickness range.








Abstract
The synthesis of fully epitaxial ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films through the use of a conducting pyrochlore oxide electrode that acts as a structural and chemical template is reported. Such pyrochlores, exemplified by Pb2Ir2O7(PIO) and Bi2Ru2O7(BRO), exhibit metallic conductivity with room&#8208;temperature resistivity of &lt;1 m&#937; cm and are closely lattice matched to yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia substrates as well as the HZO layers grown on top of them. Evidence for epitaxy and domain formation is established with X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, which show that the c&#8208;axis of the HZO film is normal to the substrate surface. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the HZO film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Thermodynamic analyses reveal the role of epitaxial strain and surface energy in stabilizing the polar phase as well as its coexistence with the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase as a function of film thickness.

         <title>Pseudosolvent Intercalator of Chitin: Self&#8208;Exfoliating into Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Thick Nanofibrils for Multifunctional Chitinous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process that can circumvent strong mechanical disintegration is developed to extract chitin nanofibrils. Having controllable thickness down to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, and high aspect ratio up to 103, these ribbon&#8208;like nanofibrils can act as new building blocks to fabricate high&#8208;performance structural materials, being applicable in optics, wearable electronics, and energy devices.








Abstract
Traditionally, energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming postmechanical disintegration processes are inevitable in extracting biopolymer nanofibrils from natural materials and thereby hinder their practical applications. Herein, a new, convenient, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient method for exfoliating nanofibrils (ChNFs) from various chitin sources via pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process is proposed. These self&#8208;exfoliated ChNFs possess controllable thickness from 2.2 to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, high aspect ratio up to 103 and customized surface chemistries. Particularly, compared with elementary nanofibrils, ChNFs with few molecular layers thick exhibit greater potential to construct high&#8208;performance structural materials, e.g., ductile nanopapers with large elongation up to 70.1% and toughness as high as 30.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, as well as soft hydrogels with typical nonlinear elasticity mimicking that of human&#8208;skin. The proposed self&#8208;exfoliation concept with unique advantages in the combination of high yield, energy efficiency, scalable productivity, less equipment requirements, and mild conditions opens up a door to extract biopolymer nanofibrils on an industrial scale. Moreover, the present modular ChNFs exfoliation will facilitate researchers to study the effect of thickness on the properties of nanofibrils and provide more insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of biopolymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Optical Microfluidic Waveguides and Solution Lasers of Colloidal Semiconductor Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution of semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) colloidally synthesized and used as the gain medium in a capillary microfluidic waveguide yields record low optical gain threshold in solution. A Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is created between the metallized sidewalls of the ends of the microfluidic channel and optically pumped along the side of the waveguide to generate a single&#8208;mode output laser beam.








Abstract
The realization of high&#8208;quality lasers in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications, including biological and chemical sensors and flow cytometry, and the development of advanced lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip (LOC) devices. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is proposed and demonstrated using an on&#8208;chip cavity. CdSe/CdS@CdxZn1&#8722;xS core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell colloidal semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) dispersed in toluene are employed in the cavity created inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device using SiO2&#8208;protected Ag mirrors to achieve in&#8208;solution lasing. Lasing from such a microfluidic device having CQWs solution as a microfluidic gain medium is shown for the first time with a record&#8208;low optical gain threshold of 17.1 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; and lasing threshold of 68.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; among all solution&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. In addition, air&#8208;stable SiO2 protected Ag films are used and designed to form highly tunable and reflective mirrors required to attain a high&#8208;quality Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. These realized record&#8208;low thresholds emanate from the high&#8208;quality on&#8208;chip cavity together with the core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell CQWs having giant gain cross&#8208;section and slow Auger rates. This microfabricated CQW laser provides a compact and inexpensive coherent light source for microfluidics and integrated optics covering the visible spectral region.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biomimetic Systems with Synergetic Color and Shape Responses Based on Oblate Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems with synergetic color and shape responses based on oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are developed. The structural colored biomimetic systems possess a lot of unique properties, such as tunable color, reversible shape change, easy processing, and flexible patterning, making them applicable in various scenarios.








Abstract
Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.

         <title>Multitasking MXene Inks Enable High&#8208;Performance Printable Microelectrochemical Energy Storage Devices for All&#8208;Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;flexible MXene&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic system is demonstrated on a single substrate through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, MXene&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries or micro&#8208;supercapacitors, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor, where the multitasking MXene is fully exploited as a high&#8208;capacitance electrode, a sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, a highly conducting current collector, a metal&#8208;free interconnector, and a conductive binder.








Abstract
The future of mankind holds great promise for things like the Internet of Things, personal health monitoring systems, and smart cities. To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large&#8208;scale manufacture of self&#8208;sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive&#8208;free high&#8208;capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal&#8208;free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as&#8208;prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm&#8722;2 and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60&#160;V. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154&#160;&#956;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an all&#8208;flexible self&#8208;powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35&#160;ms. Therefore, this multipurpose MXene ink opens a new avenue for powering future smart appliances.

         <title>Tensegrity Metamaterials: Toward Failure&#8208;Resistant Engineering Systems through Delocalized Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is typically preceded by a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events, while large parts of the system do not experience critical loads. Breaking with this established paradigm, this study introduces the concept of delocalized deformation, enabling failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials via 3D tensegrity metamaterials.








Abstract
Failure of materials and structures is inherently linked to localized mechanisms, from shear banding in metals, to crack propagation in ceramics and collapse of space&#8208;trusses after buckling of individual struts. In lightweight structures, localized deformation causes catastrophic failure, limiting their application to small strain regimes. To ensure robustness under real&#8208;world nonlinear loading scenarios, overdesigned linear&#8208;elastic constructions are adopted. Here, the concept of delocalized deformation as a pathway to failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials is introduced. Space&#8208;tileable tensegrity metamaterials achieving delocalized deformation via the discontinuity of their compression members are presented. Unprecedented failure resistance is shown, with up to 25&#8208;fold enhancement in deformability and orders of magnitude increased energy absorption capability without failure over same&#8208;strength state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lattice architectures. This study provides important groundwork for design of superior engineering systems, from reusable impact protection systems to adaptive load&#8208;bearing structures.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various electrochemical energy storage devices use movable ions in either the electrolyte or the electrodes for energy storage. A deep&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;ion battery that uses movable ions in both the electrolyte and the electrodes is developed, which offers opportunities to break the capacity limit of conventional rocking&#8208;chair Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
As the practical capacity of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) approaches the theoretical limit, which is determined by the rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture, a new cycling architecture with higher capacity is highly demanded for future development and electronic applications. Here, a deep&#8208;cycling architecture intrinsically with a higher theoretical capacity limit than conventional rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture is developed, by introducing a follow&#8208;up cycling process to contribute more capacity. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture makes full use of movable ions in both of the electrolyte and electrodes for energy storage, rather than in either the electrolyte or the electrodes. Taking LiMn2O4&#8208;mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB)/Li cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 57.7% more capacity is obtained. Moreover, the capacity retention is as high as 84.4% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture offers opportunities to break the theoretical capacity limit of conventional LIBs and makes high demands for new&#8208;type of cathode materials, which will promote the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogel Structures with Spatiotemporal Reconfigurability using Addressable and Tunable Voxels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating hyper&#8208;redundant miniaturized soft robots with multiple active degrees of freedom is challenging. Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created, demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels supports the mass production of SVAs.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.

         <title>Approaching Crystal Structure and High Electron Mobility in Conjugated Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer microwire crystals are obtained from solvated aggregates. The precise crystal packing and electronic structure in the polymer microwires are evaluated for understanding of the charge transport properties. Polymer crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208;2T exhibit higher electron mobilities of up to 5.58&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with a much lower hopping energy barrier compared with conventional thin&#8208;film transistors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers usually form crystallized and amorphous regions in the solid state simultaneously, making it difficult to accurately determine their precise microstructures. The lack of multiscale microstructures of conjugated polymers limits the fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in polymer&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, crystals of two typical conjugated polymers based on four&#8208;fluorinated benzodifurandione&#8208;based oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (F4BDOPV) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) motifs, respectively, are obtained by a controlled self&#8208;assembly process. The strong diffractivity of the polymer crystals brings an opportunity to determine the crystal structures by combining X&#8208;ray techniques and molecular simulations. The precise polymer packing structures are useful as initial models to evaluate the charge transport properties in the ordered and disordered phases. Compared to the spin&#8208;coated thin films, the highly oriented polymer chains in crystals endow higher mobilities with a lower hopping energy barrier. Microwire crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208; and NDI&#8208;based polymers exhibit high electron mobilities of up to 5.58 and 2.56&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the highest values in polymer crystals. This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.

         <title>Stabilizing Fullerene for Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under Ultraviolet Preconditioning and Light Soaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 23% efficiency is achieved using a stabilized phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM):bathophenanthroline (Bphen) interlayer in SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, which can retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
It is crucial to make perovskite solar cells sustainable and have a stable operation under natural light soaking before they become commercially acceptable. Herein, a small amount of the small molecule bathophenanthroline (Bphen) is introduced into [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester and it is found that Bphen can stabilize the C60&#8208;cage well through formation of much more thermodynamically stable charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Such a strengthened complex is used as an interlayer at the in&#8208;light perovskite/SnO2 side to achieve a champion device with efficiency of 23.09% (certified 22.85%). Most importantly, the stability of the resulting devices can be close to meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standard under simulated UV preconditioning and light&#8208;soaking testing. They can retain over 95% and 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1100 h UV irradiation and 1000 h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Change in Semiconductor by Ion&#8208;Adsorption at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;immersed Hall measurements are proposed to find direct evidence of ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Electron density&#8208;change by diffusion&#8208;driven ion dynamics occurs in a fully liquid&#8208;submerged device designed to monitor ion&#8208;specific dynamics in aqueous bulk phases. The ion&#8208;concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions are correlated with ion&#8208;adsorption rate, causing electric signal variations in the semiconductor.








Abstract
The change in electrical properties of electrodes by adsorption or desorption at interfaces is a well&#8208;known phenomenon required for signal production in electrically transduced sensing technologies. Furthermore, in terms of electrolyte&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (EIS) structure, several studies of energy conversion techniques focused on ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface have suggested that the electric signal is generated by ionovoltaic phenomena. However, finding substantial clues for the ion&#8208;adsorption phenomena in the EIS structure is still a difficult task because direct evidence for carrier accumulation in semiconductors by Coulomb interactions is insufficient.

     alt="Electron Density&#8208;Change in Semiconductor by Ion&#8208;Adsorption at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water&#8208;immersed Hall measurements are proposed to find direct evidence of ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Electron density&#8208;change by diffusion&#8208;driven ion dynamics occurs in a fully liquid&#8208;submerged device designed to monitor ion&#8208;specific dynamics in aqueous bulk phases. The ion&#8208;concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions are correlated with ion&#8208;adsorption rate, causing electric signal variations in the semiconductor.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in electrical properties of electrodes by adsorption or desorption at interfaces is a well&#8208;known phenomenon required for signal production in electrically transduced sensing technologies. Furthermore, in terms of electrolyte&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (EIS) structure, several studies of energy conversion techniques focused on ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface have suggested that the electric signal is generated by ionovoltaic phenomena. However, finding substantial clues for the ion&#8208;adsorption phenomena in the EIS structure is still a difficult task because direct evidence for carrier accumulation in semiconductors by Coulomb interactions is insufficient. Here, a sophisticated Hall measurement system is demonstrated to quantitatively analyze accumulated electron density&#8208;change inside the semiconductor depending on the ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Also, an enhanced EIS&#8208;structured device is designed in an aqueous&#8208;soaked system that works with the ionovoltaic principle to monitor the ion&#8208;dynamics in liquid electrolyte media, interestingly confirming ion&#8208;concentration dependence and ion&#8208;specificity by generated peak voltages. This newly introduced peculiar method contributes to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the ionovoltaic phenomena in terms of carrier actions in the semiconductors and ionic behaviors in the aqueous&#8208;bulk phases, providing informative analysis about interfacial adsorptions that can expand the scope of ion&#8208;sensing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Copper Tetrahydroxyquinone Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electrocatalysis at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of a 2D copper tetrahydroxyquinone conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (c&#8208;MOF) is studied in the CO2 reduction reaction. In the low overpotential range, the c&#8208;MOF catalyst delivers record values of turn&#8208;over number for CO formation and a negligible overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction. These findings open a new path for further advances in core electrochemical reactions.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for electrocatalysis; however, lack of electrical conductivity in the majority of existing MOFs limits their effective utilization in the field. Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)&#8208;based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu&#63743;THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu&#63743;THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140&#160;nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16&#160;mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of &#8776;173&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.45&#160;V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of &#8776;91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as &#8776;20.82 s&#8722;1. In the low overpotential range, the obtained CO formation current density is more than 35 and 25 times higher compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF and MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, respectively. The operando Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the existence of reduced Cu (Cu+) during CO2RR which reversibly returns to Cu2+ after the reaction. The outstanding CO2 catalytic functionality of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) can open a way toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems.

         <title>Ductile Ag20S7Te3 with Excellent Shape&#8208;Conformability and High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) material, Ag20S7Te3, with high carrier mobility, low lattice thermal conductivity, and a maximum zT of 0.80 at 600 K is reported. The prototype hetero&#8208;shaped TE generator consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#956;W under a temperature difference of 70 K.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric (TE) generators (TEGs) can power the sensors used in safety monitoring systems of undersea oil pipelines, but their development is greatly limited by the lack of materials with both good shape&#8208;conformable ability and high TE performance. In this work, a new ductile inorganic TE material, Ag20S7Te3, with high TE performance is reported. At 300&#8211;600 K, Ag20S7Te3 crystallizes in a body&#8208;centered cubic structure, in which S and Te atoms randomly occupy the (0, 0, 1) site. Due to the smaller generalized stacking fault energy in the (101&#175;)[010] slip system, Ag20S7Te3 shows better ductility than Ag2S, yielding excellent shape&#8208;conformability. The high carrier mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity observed in Ag20S7Te3 result in a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 0.80 at 600 K, which is comparable with the best commercial Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys. The prototype TEG consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#181;W under the temperature difference of 70 K. This study creates a new route toward hetero&#8208;shaped TEG.

         <title>A Biodegradable Secondary Battery and its Biodegradation Mechanism for Eco&#8208;Friendly Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The environmental issues caused by the disposal of an increasing amount of used batteries have become a great challenge. A material and design strategy for a fully biodegradable rechargeable battery to address this concern is reported. A novel material&#8208;selection guideline and design rule provide a viable demonstration of a non&#8208;toxic and eco&#8208;friendly battery, which decomposes via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation.








Abstract
The production of rechargeable batteries is rapidly expanding, and there are going to be new challenges in the near future about how the potential environmental impact caused by the disposal of the large volume of the used batteries can be minimized. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to address these concerns by applying biodegradable device technology. An eco&#8208;friendly and biodegradable sodium&#8208;ion secondary battery (SIB) is developed through extensive material screening followed by the synthesis of biodegradable electrodes and their seamless assembly with an unconventional biodegradable separator, electrolyte, and package. Each battery component decomposes in nature into non&#8208;toxic compounds or elements via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation, with all of the biodegradation products naturally abundant and eco&#8208;friendly. Detailed biodegradation mechanisms and toxicity influence of each component on living organisms are determined. In addition, this new SIB delivers performance comparable to that of conventional non&#8208;degradable SIBs. The strategy and findings suggest a novel eco&#8208;friendly biodegradable paradigm for large&#8208;scale rechargeable battery systems.

         <title>Exfoliation of Alpha&#8208;Germanium: A Covalent Diamond&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Germanium crystals are exfoliated using a wet ball&#8208;milling technique to produce &#945;&#8208;germanium nanolayers (&#945;&#8208;Ge NLs) in a process that is upscaled to gram production. The &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs can be redispersed using a shear&#8208;mixer, yielding very stable suspensions. Theoretical calculations predict a thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap of these NLs that is confirmed by electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy of &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs with different orientations.








Abstract
2D materials have opened a new field in materials science with outstanding scientific and technological impact. A largely explored route for the preparation of 2D materials is the exfoliation of layered crystals with weak forces between their layers. However, its application to covalent crystals remains elusive. Herein, a further step is taken by introducing the exfoliation of germanium, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor presenting a 3D diamond&#8208;like structure with strong covalent bonds. Pure &#945;&#8208;germanium is exfoliated following a simple one&#8208;step procedure assisted by wet ball&#8208;milling, allowing gram&#8208;scale fabrication of high&#8208;quality layers with large lateral dimensions and nanometer thicknesses. The generated flakes are thoroughly characterized by different techniques, giving evidence that the new 2D material exhibits bandgaps that depend on both the crystallographic direction and the number of layers. Besides potential technological applications, this work is also of interest for the search of 2D materials with new properties.

     alt="Exfoliation of Alpha&#8208;Germanium: A Covalent Diamond&#8208;Like Structure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;&#8208;Germanium crystals are exfoliated using a wet ball&#8208;milling technique to produce &#945;&#8208;germanium nanolayers (&#945;&#8208;Ge NLs) in a process that is upscaled to gram production. The &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs can be redispersed using a shear&#8208;mixer, yielding very stable suspensions. Theoretical calculations predict a thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap of these NLs that is confirmed by electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy of &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs with different orientations.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials have opened a new field in materials science with outstanding scientific and technological impact. A largely explored route for the preparation of 2D materials is the exfoliation of layered crystals with weak forces between their layers. However, its application to covalent crystals remains elusive. Herein, a further step is taken by introducing the exfoliation of germanium, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor presenting a 3D diamond&#8208;like structure with strong covalent bonds. Pure &#945;&#8208;germanium is exfoliated following a simple one&#8208;step procedure assisted by wet ball&#8208;milling, allowing gram&#8208;scale fabrication of high&#8208;quality layers with large lateral dimensions and nanometer thicknesses. The generated flakes are thoroughly characterized by different techniques, giving evidence that the new 2D material exhibits bandgaps that depend on both the crystallographic direction and the number of layers. Besides potential technological applications, this work is also of interest for the search of 2D materials with new properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

         <title>Tensegrity Metamaterials: Tensegrity Metamaterials: Toward Failure&#8208;Resistant Engineering Systems through Delocalized Deformation (Adv. Mater. 10/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is the inevitable consequence of a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events. Breaking with this paradigm, in article number 2005647, Julian J. Rimoli, Lorenzo Valdevit, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel class of tensegrity metamaterials. By connecting isolated loops of compressive elements through a continuous tension network, these metamaterials delocalize deformation, demonstrating a pathway toward superior failure&#8208;resistant engineering systems.

         <title>Transformative Electronics: Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces (Adv. Mater. 10/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2007239, Byung Jin Cho, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong, and co&#8208;workers present a design strategy for transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning. Transformative electronics are built on a gallium platform interfaced with graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device (f&#8208;TED). The graphene works as a catalyst to mitigate the supercooling phenomenon in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of gallium, and the f&#8208;TED offers active temperature control to help accelerate the rigid&#8211;soft transformation of the overall system.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006794, Jian Pei and co&#8208;workers report the microwire crystal and crystal structures of two widely used conjugated polymers. High electron mobility and a lower hopping energy barrier are achieved in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated using the polymer crystals. The crystal structures are successfully determined through the combination of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling.

An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated by Taimur Ahmed, Sumeet Walia, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004207. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image preprocessing in an imaging array and optoelectronic machine learning for pattern classification and image recognition through deploying artificial neural networks.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film quality is a governing factor determining the performance of RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The RP film quality for fabricating high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is discussed. Evaluation index and influential factors of RP perovskite films are reviewed. Based on this, strategies to improve RP perovskite film quality are also proposed.








Abstract
In the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone unprecedented rapid development and become a promising candidate for a new&#8208;generation solar cell. Among various PSCs, typical 3D halide perovskite&#8208;based PSCs deliver the highest efficiency but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. By contrast, the low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite&#8208;based PSCs have recently raised increasing attention due to their superior stability. Yet, the efficiency of RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is still far from that of the 3D counterparts owing to the difficulty in fabricating high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. In pursuit of high&#8208;efficiency RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, it is critical to manipulate the film formation process to prepare high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. This review aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the high&#8208;quality RP&#8208;type perovskite film formation by investigating the influential factors. On this basis, several strategies to improve the RP perovskite film quality are proposed via summarizing the recent progress and efforts on the preparation of high&#8208;quality RP perovskite film. This review will provide useful guidelines for a better understanding of the crystallization and phase kinetics during RP perovskite film formation process and the design and development of high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, promoting the commercialization of PSC technology.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art and Future Challenges in High Energy Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since the Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes but multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate further insightful work.








Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SexSy cathodes, and mainly focusing on their structures, compositions, and synthetic strategies. Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs. Last, the remaining challenges and research orientations in this booming field are proposed, which are expected to motivate more insightful works.

         <title>Giant and Reversible Barocaloric Effect in Trinuclear Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant and robust barocaloric effect is demonstrated in a trinuclear Fe(II) complex that exhibits an abrupt spin&#8208;state transition with a negligible hysteresis. The pressure&#8208;dependent transition spans temperatures between 318 K at ambient pressure and 383 K at 2.6 kbar. The reversible entropy and temperature changes observed are among the highest reported for any caloric material thus far.








Abstract
A giant barocaloric effect (BCE) in a molecular material Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6 (FBT) is reported, where bntrz = 4&#8208;(benzyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and tcnset = 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;2&#8208;thioethylepropenide. The crystal structure of FBT contains a trinuclear transition metal complex that undergoes an abrupt spin&#8208;state switching between the state in which all three FeII centers are in the high&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 2) electronic configuration and the state in which all of them are in the low&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 0) configuration. Despite the strongly cooperative nature of the spin transition, it proceeds with a negligible hysteresis and a large volumetric change, suggesting that FBT should be a good candidate for producing a large BCE. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and calorimetry reveal that the material is highly susceptible to applied pressure, as the transition temperature spans the range from 318 at ambient pressure to 383 K at 2.6 kbar. Despite the large shift in the spin&#8208;transition temperature, its nonhysteretic character is maintained under applied pressure. Such behavior leads to a remarkably large and reversible BCE, characterized by an isothermal entropy change of 120 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and an adiabatic temperature change of 35 K, which are among the highest reversible values reported for any caloric material thus far.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Charge Separation Strategies in Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency greatly relies on effective charge separation. The recent progress of atomic&#8208;level strategies for promoting charge separation and migration in the bulk, on the surface, and both bulk and surface of a photocatalyst are highlighted and a guideline for the bottom&#8208;up design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts suggested.








Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis as a productive technology furnishes a prospective solution to environmental and renewable energy issues, but its efficiency greatly relies&#160;on the effective bulk and surface separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Exploitation of atomic&#8208;level strategies allows in&#8208;depth understanding on the related mechanisms and enables bottom&#8208;up precise design of photocatalysts, significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, the advances on atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies toward developing robust photocatalysts are highlighted, elucidating the fundamentals of charge separation and transfer processes and advanced probing techniques. The atomic&#8208;level bulk charge separation strategies, embodied by regulation of charge movement pathway and migration dynamic, boil&#160;down&#160;to shortening the charge diffusion distance to the atomic&#8208;scale, establishing atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels, and enhancing the charge separation driving force. Meanwhile, regulating the in&#8208;plane surface structure and spatial surface structure are summarized as atomic&#8208;level surface charge separation strategies. Moreover, collaborative strategies for simultaneous manipulation of bulk and surface photocharges are also introduced. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts are discussed on the basis of a thorough comprehension of atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure endows the ZIBs with high flexibility and electrochemical performance as well as the ability to be tailored and edited into desired shapes and structures. Furthermore, they can be integrated with solar cells into an energy harvesting and storage integrated system.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered to be a promising candidate for flexible energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. However, the scalable assembly of flexible ZIBs is still a challenge. Here, a scalable assembly strategy is developed to fabricate flexible ZIBs with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure by combining blade coating with a rolling assembly process. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one integrated structure can effectively avoid the relative displacement or detachment between neighboring components to ensure continuous and effective ion&#8208; and/or loading&#8208;transfer capacity under external deformation, resulting in excellent structural and electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs can be tailored and edited controllably into desired shapes and structures, further extending their editable, stretchable, and shape&#8208;customized functions. In addition, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs display the ability to integrate with perovskite solar cells to achieve an energy harvesting and storage integrated system. These enlighten a broad area of flexible ZIBs to be compatible with highly flexible and wearable electronics. The scaling&#8208;up assembly strategy provides a route to design other ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy storage devices with stretchable, editable, and customizable behaviors.

         <title>Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.








Abstract
Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers. Increased efficiency of the current&#8208;induced domain wall motion is a prerequisite for commercially viable racetrack devices. Here, significantly increased efficiency with substantially lower threshold current densities and enhanced domain wall velocities is demonstrated by the introduction of atomically thin 4d and 5d metal &#8220;dusting&#8221; layers at the interface between the lower magnetic layer of the racetrack (here cobalt) and platinum. The greatest efficiency is found for dusting layers of palladium and rhodium, just one monolayer thick, for which the domain wall's velocity is increased by up to a factor of 3.5. Remarkably, when the heavy metal layer is formed from the dusting layer material alone, the efficiency is rather reduced by an order of magnitude. The results point to the critical role of interface engineering for the development of efficient racetrack memory devices.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineering Induced Anisotropic Crystallite Orientation and Maximized Carrier Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Microfiber&#8208;Based Organic Bioelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors are reported, which display unprecedentedly large figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#956;C*&#160;&#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) using highly ordered crystalline PEDOT:PSS microfibers with enhanced carrier mobility (12.9&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) owing to the highly anisotropic crystallite domain ordering along the fiber direction via uniaxial strain engineering in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization.








Abstract
Despite the importance of carrier mobility, recent research efforts have been mainly focused on the improvement of volumetric capacitance in order to maximize the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, &#956;C* (product of carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance), for high&#8208;performance organic electrochemical transistors. Herein, high&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors with unprecedentedly large &#956;C* using highly ordered crystalline poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) microfibers with very high carrier mobilities are reported. The strain engineering via uniaxial tension is employed in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization in the course of drying coagulated fibers, resulting in the permanent preferential alignment of crystalline PEDOT:PSS domains along the fiber direction, which is verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The resultant strain&#8208;engineered microfibers exhibit very high carrier mobility (12.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) and hole density (5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1020&#160;cm&#8722;3). Such advantageous electrical and electrochemical characteristics offer the benchmark parameter of &#956;C* over &#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest metric ever reported in the literature and can be beneficial for realizing a new class of substrate&#8208;free fibrillar and/or textile bioelectronics in the configuration of electrochemical transistors and/or electrochemical ion pumps.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field: A New Mechanism Promoting Mass Transfer in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanistic understanding of the enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is achieved by employing dense arrays of nanocones with sharp tips. A local electric field promotes aggregation of hydroxide ions  near the high&#8208;curvature active sites, leading to lower overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared to blunt cones.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) causes high power consumption for electrochemical water splitting. Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1&#8211;x alloy nanocones arrays (with &#8776;2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)2 layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high&#8208;curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assembled Vacuolated Coacervates Control Macromolecule Spatiotemporal Distribution to Provide a Stable Segregated Cell Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups can self&#8208;assemble into stable vacuolated coacervates under physiological conditions, driven by physical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) derived from the end groups of the hydrophilic shell, thus providing novel insights into the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of coacervate organelles.








Abstract
Membraneless coacervate compartments in the intracellular and pericellular space mediate critical cellular functions. Developing synthetic coacervates that emulate the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of these natural coacervates is challenging but highly desirable. Herein, a generalizable nanoparticle assembly (NPA) strategy is developed, which is applicable to interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups, to fabricate vacuolated coacervates. The obtained NPA coacervates contain stable internal vacuoles to provide segregated microcompartments, which can mediate the spatially heterogeneous distribution of diverse macromolecules via restricted diffusion. It is further shown that the vacuolated NPA coacervates can harbor and retain macromolecular medium supplements to regulate the functions of cells encapsulated in vacuoles. Furthermore, the restricted macromolecule diffusion can be abolished on demand via the triggered coacervate&#8211;hydrogel transition, thereby altering the exposure of encapsulated cells to environmental factors. It is believed that the NPA strategy provides new insights into the design principles of hierarchical coacervates that hold promising potential for a wide array of biomedical applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of the enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Revealing Structural Disorder in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon for a Low&#8208;Loss Photonic Platform at Visible Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bonding networks of hydrogenated amorphous silicon are revealed to reduce its optical loss in the visible region. Atomic bonding networks are manipulated by controlling the process conditions of plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The optimal atomic configuration demonstrates the low&#8208;loss hydrogenated amorphous silicon as being an efficient photonic platform by expanding the working frequencies from the infrared to the visible spectrum.








Abstract
The high refractive index of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) at optical frequencies is an essential property for the efficient modulation of the phase and amplitude of light. However, substantial optical loss represented by its high extinction coefficient prevents it from being utilized widely. Here, the bonding configurations of a&#8208;Si:H are investigated, in order to manipulate the extinction coefficient and produce a material that is competitive with conventional transparent materials, such as titanium dioxide and gallium nitride. This is achieved by controlling the hydrogenation and silicon disorder by adjusting the chemical deposition conditions. The extinction coefficient of the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H reaches a minimum of 0.082 at the wavelength of 450&#160;nm, which is lower than that of crystalline silicon (0.13). Beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces are demonstrated to validate the low&#8208;loss optical properties, reaching measured efficiencies of 42%, 62%, and 75% at the wavelengths of 450, 532, and 635&#160;nm, respectively. Considering its compatibility with mature complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor processes, the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H will provide a platform for efficient photonic operating in the full visible regime.

         <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese&#8208;based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials. The uniquely high catalytic activity and durability (over 5 months) of the latter precursors in alkaline media are attributed to its unexpected surface transformation into an amorphous MnOx phase with a birnessite&#8208;like short&#8208;range order and surface&#8208;stabilized MnIII sites under extended electrical bias, as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion by Interfacial Skew Scattering in Metallic Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terahertz emission spectroscopy is used to study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (S2C) in ferromagnetic (F)|nonmagnetic (N) bilayer metal thin films. The measurements indicate that S2C at the F/N interfaces can become comparable to the overall S2C and that the sign is drastically affected by interface modifications. A possible extrinsic S2C mechanism, skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interfacial imperfections, is suggested.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of spin to charge transport and vice versa is of major relevance for the detection and generation of spin currents in spin&#8208;based electronics. Interfaces of heterostructures are known to have a marked impact on this process. Here, terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy is used to study ultrafast spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion (S2C) in about 50 prototypical F|N bilayers consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F (e.g., Ni81Fe19, Co, or Fe) and a nonmagnetic layer N with strong (Pt) or weak (Cu and Al) spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Varying the structure of the F/N interface leads to a drastic change in the amplitude and even inversion of the polarity of the THz charge current. Remarkably, when N is a material with small spin Hall angle, a dominant interface contribution to the ultrafast charge current is found. Its magnitude amounts to as much as about 20% of that found in the F|Pt reference sample. Symmetry arguments and first&#8208;principles calculations strongly suggest that the interfacial S2C arises from skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interface imperfections. The results highlight the potential of skew scattering for interfacial S2C and propose a promising route to enhanced S2C by tailored interfaces at all frequencies from DC to terahertz.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Directional Polarized Light Emission from Thin&#8208;Film Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly directional and polarized light emission is demonstrated in thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) by suppressing the background emission and extracting only the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode. It is found that the TE waveguide mode increases with the refractive index of the emitting layer and a 2.6 times higher current efficiency is achieved in a perovskite LED.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with directional and polarized light emission have many photonic applications, and beam shaping of these devices is fundamentally challenging because they are Lambertian light sources. In this work, using organic and perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) for demonstrations, by selectively diffracting the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode while suppressing other optical modes in a nanostructured LED, the authors first demonstrate highly directional light emission from a full&#8208;area organic LED with a small divergence angle less than 3&#176; and a TE to transverse magnetic (TM) polarization extinction ratio of 13. The highly selective diffraction of only the TE waveguide mode is possible due to the planarization of the device stack by thermal evaporation and solution processing. Using this strategy, directional and polarized emission from a perovskite LED having a current efficiency 2.6 times compared to the reference planar device is further demonstrated. This large enhancement in efficiency in the PeLED is attributed to a larger contribution from the TE waveguide mode resulting from the high refractive index in perovskite materials.

         <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

A hydrogel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, ultralow freezing point, excellent mechanical properties, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability is constructed. It can effectively suppress the growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of parasitic side reactions, thereby enabling a high&#8208;performance flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery that can work normally in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next&#8208;generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective method is developed to construct an all&#8208;round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record&#8208;breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions. This work opens new opportunities for the development of hydrogel electrolytes.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. It is shown that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &#8776;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin&#8208;film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Fluorophore Photostability Enabled by Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophores are much more photostable on organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs) than on glass. On a glass substrate, fluorophores are photobleached almost immediately; highly photostable fluorophores, however, are observed on an OHM substrate. Fluorophore photobleaching lifetimes are lengthened up to four orders of magnitude with a 230&#8208;fold increase in photon count.








Abstract
The dynamics of photons in fluorescent molecules plays a key role in fluorescence imaging, optical sensing, organic photovoltaics, and displays. Photobleaching is an irreversible photodegradation process of fluorophores, representing a fundamental limitation in relevant optical applications. Chemical reagents are used to suppress the photobleaching rate but with exceptionally high specificity for each type of fluorophore. Here, using organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs), an optical platform to achieve unprecedented fluorophore photostability without any chemical specificity is demonstrated. A more than 500&#8208;fold lengthening of the photobleaching lifetime and a 230&#8208;fold increase in the total emitted photon counts are observed simultaneously. These exceptional improvements solely come from the low&#8208;loss hyperbolic dispersion of OHM films and the large resultant Purcell effect in the visible spectral range. The demonstrated OHM platform may open up a new paradigm in nanophotonics and organic plasmonics for super&#8208;resolution imaging and the engineering of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale.

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to those of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

         <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Deep Tumor&#8208;Penetrating Radio&#8208; and Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.








Abstract
Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

         <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

         <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

         <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

         <title>Strong Chemical Interaction between Lithium Polysulfides and Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphosphazene for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Safety and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper can not only increase the electrochemical performance via strong chemical interaction between components, but also improves the safety of batteries due to the high and low temperature resistance property as well as the good flame&#8208;retardant characteristics of PPZ.








Abstract
The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and potential safety hazard caused by the burning of flammable organic electrolytes, sulfur cathode, and lithium anode seriously limit the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, a flame&#8208;retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li&#8211;S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as&#8208;obtained flame&#8208;retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as&#8208;obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame&#8208;retardant &#8220;vice&#8208;electrode,&#8221; which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li&#8211;S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ&#8208;based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer toward next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to a hemispherical support realizing imaging of the light distribution, indicating potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization: Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass is one of the most important materials for optical applications but it is difficult to shape on the microscale. In article number 2006341, Frederik Kotz and co&#8208;workers present two&#8208;photon polymerization of nanocomposites, which are subsequently converted to transparent fused silica glass. The cover shows a glass microtower fabricated by this process.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network Structures: Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004707, Joon Hak Oh, Jong&#8208;Beom Baek, and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of fused aromatic network structures with C5N basal plane stoichiometry. Thin films cast onto silicon dioxide substrates from the C5N solution exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinary high electron and hole mobilities in field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) devices, superior to the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping.

         <title>2D Materials: Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single graphene sheet is stacked on top of monolayer MoS2. The 2D heterostructure is buckled out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, inducing bending in both layers. In article number 2007269, Arend M. van der Zande, Pinshane Y. Huang, and co&#8208;workers study the impact of interfacial engineering on the tunability of the bending stiffness in 2D multilayers. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of any arbitrary 2D heterostructure.

         <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented.

&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

         <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

         <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms have been designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points toward a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

         <title>RhSe2: A Superior 3D Electrocatalyst with Multiple Active Facets for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acid and Alkaline Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D structured transition metal sulfide, RhSe2, is synthesized, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials are a vital class of electrocatalys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large area, excellent activity, and facile fabrication. Theoretical caculations domenstrate, however, that only the edges of the 2D nanosheets act as active sites, while the much larger basal plane exhibits passive activity. Here, from a distinguishing perspective, RhSe2 is reported as a &#8220;3D&#8221; electrocatalyst for HER with top&#8208;class activity, synthesized by a facile solid&#8208;state method. Superior to 2D materials, multiple crystal facets of RhSe2 exhibit near&#8208;zero free energy change of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which guarantees high performance in most common morphologies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Rh atoms act as the active sites in acid, which enables the modified Kubas&#8208;mediated pathway, while the Se atoms act as the active sites in an alkaline medium. The overpotentials of HER activity of RhSe2 are measured to be 49.9 and 81.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively. This work paves the way to new transition metal chalcogenide catalysts.

A porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheet with controllable Ti3+ concentration is prepared by a reproducible bottom&#8208;up strategy. The optimal C&#8208;TiOx with high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ exhibits a NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, the highest compared with all previously reported TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic ammonia synthesis is exciting but quite challenging with a very moderate yield at present. One of the greatest challenges is to develop highly active centers in a photocatalyst for N2 reduction under ambient conditions. Herein, porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheets with high&#8208;concentration active sites of Ti3+ are presented, which are produced by layered Ti3SiC2 through a reproducible bottom&#8208;up approach. It is shown that the high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ sites are the major species for the significant increase in N2 photoreduction activity by the C&#8208;TiOx. Such bottom&#8208;up substitutional doping of C into TiO2 is responsible for both visible absorption and generation of Ti3+ concentration. Together with the porous nanosheets morphology and the loading of a Ru/RuO2 nanosized cocatalyst for enhanced charge separation and transfer, the optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 72.1% shows a high NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, which is the highest compared to all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts at present.
