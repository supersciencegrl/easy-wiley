This study presents new insights into biodegradable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence theranostic nanoparticles by coassembling a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer as well as an amphiphilic polyester with doxorubicin via reactive oxygen species responsive thioketal linkages for photodynamic immunotherapy and photoactivated chemotherapy.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co&#8208;assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate&#160;ROS&#160;for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self&#8208;sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.

         <title>Complement&#8208;Opsonized NIR&#8208;IIb Emissive Immunotracers for Dynamically Monitoring Neutrophils in Inflammation&#8208;Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complement C3 opsonized near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb emissive immunotracers are captured by inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in circulatory blood through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis, enabling dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The strategy of modulating surface chemistry of nanosized imaging agents to enhance complement C3 opsonization provides a new insight to develop immunotracers for in vivo labeling and tracking neutrophils.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of neutrophil dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking of neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of the complement system, a strategy of enhancing the complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a near infrared&#8208;IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils, is reported herein. Four kinds of surface&#8208;modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG&#8208;modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkages with C3b active fragments under inflammation conditions, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamic monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <dc:description>
Implantable biomaterials and devices, such as vascular stents, artificial heart valves, bioprosthetic cardiac occluders, artificial grafts cardiac patches, atrial shunts, and injectable hydrogels against heart failure, have become effective means in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. An overview of the challenges and research frontier of innovative biomaterials and devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases have become the leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases has become a major public health problem and how to carry out efficient and reliable treatment of cardiovascular diseases has become an urgent global problem to be solved.

         <title>Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 Trifunctional Catalyst with Tailored Electronic Structures Enabling Boosted Activities and Corrosion Resistance in an Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 with a harmonized electronic structure can achieve strong O&#8208;binding ability, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722;&#8208;binding ability, which helps to repel Cl&#8722; anions for enhanced corrosion resistance and optimization of the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER performance simultaneously, displaying promising potential for application in an uninterrupted seawater splitting system.








Abstract
Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistant trifunctional catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single Co&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts with well&#8208;defined symmetric Co&#63743;N4 sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P&#8208;doping into Co&#63743;N&#63743;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 sites with symmetry&#8208;breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S&#8208;ZABs) with superior long&#8208;term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self&#8208;driven seawater splitting powered by S&#8208;ZABs gives ultrahigh H2 production rates of 497&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&#8722; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Unraveling the Correlation between Raman and Photoluminescence in Monolayer MoS2 through Machine&#8208;Learning Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of machine&#8208;learning techniques is utilized to effectively discover the hidden pattern between Raman&#8208; and PL&#8208;spectra of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which provide insights into the physical mechanisms connecting PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intense and tunable photoluminescence (PL) have opened up new opportunities for optoelectronic and photonic applications such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and single&#8208;photon emitters. Among the standard characterization tools for 2D materials, Raman spectroscopy stands out as a fast and non&#8208;destructive technique capable of probing material's&#160;crystallinity and perturbations such as doping and strain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between photoluminescence and Raman spectra in monolayer&#160;MoS2 remains elusive due to its highly nonlinear nature. Here, the connections between PL signatures and Raman modes are systematically explored, providing comprehensive insights into the physical mechanisms correlating PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models. First, a dense convolutional network (DenseNet)&#160;to predict PL maps by spatial Raman maps is deployed. Moreover, a gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to bridge the impact of individual Raman features in PL features is applied. Last, a support vector machine (SVM) to project PL features on Raman frequencies is adopted. This work may serve as a methodology for applying machine learning to characterizations of 2D materials.

         <title>Directed Evolution Enables Simultaneous Controlled Release of Multiple Therapeutic Proteins from Biopolymer&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution enables the identification of distinct binding partners to multiple therapeutically&#8208;relevant proteins, thereby enabling their bioactive, independently&#8208;tunable, and simultaneous controlled release from hydrogel delivery vehicles.








Abstract
With the advent of increasingly complex combination strategies of biologics, independent control over their delivery is the key to their efficacy; however, current approaches are hindered by the limited independent tunability of their release rates. To overcome these limitations, directed evolution is used to engineer highly specific, low affinity affibody binding partners to multiple therapeutic proteins to independently control protein release rates. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, specific affibody binding partners for two proteins with broad therapeutic utility: insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 (IGF&#8208;1) and pigment epithelium&#8208;derived factor (PEDF) are identified. Protein&#8211;affibody binding interactions specific to these target proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between 10&#8722;7 and 10&#8722;8 m are discovered. The affibodies are covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF&#8208;1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system is tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody&#8208;controlled release of IGF&#8208;1 results in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF&#8208;1 delivery. This work demonstrates a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies is paved.

&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) between 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; are discovered. The affibodies are covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF-1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system is tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody-controlled release of IGF-1 results in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF-1 delivery. This work demonstrates a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies is paved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles As a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>

Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, we engineered a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>

Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning refractive index. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the inter&#8208;particle gap which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, we prepared hetero&#8208;ligand AuNPs which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8208;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles&#8221;. NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibit the refractive index tunability. In visible and NIR, our 2D superstructures exhibited the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8764;7.8) with varying the size and inter&#8208;particle gap of NPs, which was successfully explained by plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Controllable Heterogeneous Seeding Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>

Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study was conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, we propose a new strategy &#8211; &#8220;heterogeneous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite. In this work, the (t&#8208;Bu)2PMeHBF4 is directly introduced into the precursor which forms a low solubility complex with PbI2. The low solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of perovskite during the solvent evaporation process. Various in situ measurement tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which has been shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite. The hetero&#8208;SiC greatly improves the film quality, reduces the film defects, and suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination. The hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% PCE, well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC PSC stability under light illumination is enhanced and retains 84 percent of its initial performance after 1400 hours of light illumination.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Coacervate&#8208;Core Vesicles with Semipermeable Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate droplets are promising protocell candidates. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their survival and ability to interact. This work shows that short tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequently transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation. The coacervate&#8208;core vesicles are semipermeable and can host enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher&#8208;order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation in a well&#8208;defined pH window and transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross&#8208;linking at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine&#8208;rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut&#8208;off of 2.5&#160;kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into the membrane&#8208;enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1kBT, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, it is shown that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane&#8208;bound compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of communication or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

         <title>Tunable Strong Coupling in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of subwavelength optical nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong coupling between excitons and Mie resonances is demonstrated to support Mie&#8208;exciton polaritons. Moreover, the optical coupling can be further tuned by optothermal effects in a reversible and reproducible way.








Abstract
Subwavelength optical resonators with spatiotemporal control of light are essential to the miniaturization of optical devices. In this work, chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of dielectric nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong light&#8211;matter couplings and tunable exciton polaritons in individual nanowires are demonstrated. In addition, the excitonic responses can be reversibly modulated with excellent reproducibility, offering the potential for developing tunable optical nanodevices. Being in the mobile colloidal state with highly tunable optical properties, the TMDC nanoresonators will find promising applications in integrated active optical devices, including all&#8208;optical switches and sensors.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Magnon&#8208;Mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;Oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnon current excited in an insulating antiferromagnetic layer by an electronic spin current in an epitaxial all&#8208;oxide heterostructure is demonstrated to be effective for manipulating the perpendicular magnetization in a ferromagnetic layer. Furthermore, the critical current density to switch the magnetization is about one order of magnitude smaller than in conventional metallic systems.








Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8208;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Ultrahigh&#8208;Responsivity MoS2 Nanosheet Photodetectors Enabled by Megasonic Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aerosol&#8208;jet printed (AJP) photodetectors are fabricated using megasonically exfoliated MoS2 channels and graphene electrodes. Superlative optoelectronic performance is attributed to the megasonically thinned MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in responsivities that exceed previous all&#8208;printed visible photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Printed 2D&#160;materials, derived from solution&#8208;processed inks, offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micrometer&#8208;scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol&#8208;jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all&#8208;printed circuits and systems. Here, AJP is utilized to achieve ultrahigh&#8208;responsivity photodetectors consisting of well&#8208;aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m lateral size) MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent terpineol into the MoS2 ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin&#8208;film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi&#8208;ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 103&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 that outperform previously reported all&#8208;printed visible&#8208;light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Poly(arylene piperidine) Quaternary Ammonium Salts Promoting Stable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#160;system is developed based on the electrostatic interaction acting between a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and a polymer phosphor. The quaternization of the polymeric phosphors significantly enhances the RTP performance, and a&#160;bright&#8208;green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 960&#160;ms can be observed even after soaking in water&#160;for a month.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable research attention owing to their excellent luminescence properties and potential application prospects in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and optoelectronics. However, several RTP systems are extremely sensitive to humidity, and consequently, the realization of long&#8208;lived RTP in water remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a feasible and effective strategy is presented to achieve long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP systems, even in an aqueous environment, through doping of synthesized polymeric phosphor PBHDB into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Compared to the precursor polymer PBN and organic molecule HDBP, a more rigid polymer microenvironment and electrostatic interaction are formed between the PMMA matrix and polymer PBHDB, which effectively reduce&#160;the nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons and dramatically increase&#160;the phosphorescence intensity. Specifically, the phosphorescence lifetime of the PBHDB@PMMA film (1258.62&#160;ms) is much longer than those of PBN@PMMA (674.20&#160;ms) and HDBP@PMMA (1.06&#160;ms). Most importantly, a bright&#8208;green afterglow can be observed after soaking the PBHDB@PMMA film in water for more than a month. The excellent water resistance and reversible response properties endow these systems with promising potential for dynamic information encryption even in water.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterisation, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure &#8211; electronic structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by PLE spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step towards exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration however continue to hinder their further progress. Here, we&#160;use an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron Grazing&#8208;Incidence Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering technique to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, we&#160;demonstrate that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, we&#160;propose that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. Our&#160;findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8208;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing high efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes, however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, we report that homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8208;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8208;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

         <title>An initial covalent&#8208;organic polymer with closed&#8208;F edges directly for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells</title>

Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g. proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration towards electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, we reported an initial F&#8208;decorated full closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F). The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS), exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among pristine conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;network&#8208;based catalysts in device manner to date.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Metal All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries and Stable Li Plating Enabled by In&#160;Situ Formation of Li3PS4 in the SEI Layer</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) composite solid electrolytes and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing Li3PS4. This simple and effective approach of constructing a highly&#160;Li+&#8208;conductive, electronically insulating, chemically/electrochemically stable, and mechanically compatible Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF SEI can lead to small interfacial resistance and uniform lithium plating, which makes Li&#8208;metal&#8208;anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries possible.








Abstract
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing Li3PS4. A specially&#160;designed sulfide, lithium polysulfidophosphate (LPS), can distribute uniformly in the PEO matrix via a simple stirring process because of its complete solubility in acetonitrile solvent, which is advantageous for creating a homogeneous SEI layer. The CSE/Li interface with high Li+ transportation capability is stabilized quickly through in&#160;situ formation of a Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF layer via the reaction between LPS and lithium metal to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. A Li/Li symmetric cell with the LPS&#8208;integrated CSE exhibits constant and small CSE/Li resistance of 10&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2&#160;during cycling, delivering stable cycling for 3475&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and a high critical current density of 0.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;at 60&#160;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is also demonstrated for LiFePO4/CSE/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with capacity of 127.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 1000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>The Promise of Soft Matter Enabled Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. In contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor materials structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum materials properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which could arise from their bridging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Chlorambucil Conjugate As A Type II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccine</title>

Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a series of ICD inducers were recently reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, we develop an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer SA&#8208;Cbl by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in ER to induce rapid ROS generation and unfolded protein response process, which led to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl was verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity sensitive organic fluorophores.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8208;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning towards N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare isolated Cu atoms incorporated Bi24O31Br10 materials. The local polarization can be created along Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3 and 88.2 times improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate arrive 291.1&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8208;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between catalyst's surface and N2 molecule, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#8208;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tune the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

         <title>Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Oxide Semiconductor Devices: A Key Building Block for Applications Ranging from Display Backplanes to 3D Integrated Semiconductor Chips</title>

Abstract
As Si has faced physical limits on further scaling down, novel semiconducting materials such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and oxide semiconductors (OS) have gained tremendous attention to continue the ever&#8208;demanding downscaling represented by Moore's law. Amongst, OS is considered to be the most promising alternative material because it has intriguing features such as modest mobility, extremely low off&#8208;current, great uniformity, and low temperature processibility with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor&#8208;compatible methods. In practice, OS has successfully replaced hydrogenated amorphous Si in high&#8208;end liquid crystal display devices and has now become a standard backplane electronic for organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays despite the short time since their invention in 2004. For OS to be implemented in next generation electronics such as back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line transistor applications in monolithic three&#8208;dimensional integration beyond the display applications, however, there is still much room to be studied such as high mobility, imune short&#8208;channel effects, and low electrical contact properties etc. This study reviews the brief history of OS and recent progress in device applications from a material science and device physics point of view. Simultaneously, remaining challenges and opportunities in OS for use in next generation electronics are discussed.

         <title>A single&#8208;molecule memristor based on an electric field&#8208;driven dynamical structure reconfiguration</title>

Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor was prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into the nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching was realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments; therefore, unveiling both intra&#8208;molecular and inter&#8208;molecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states were achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>Harnessing Polymer Matrix&#8208;Mediated Manipulation of Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer for Near&#8208;Infrared Security Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Precise recognition of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) signal holds great prospects in optical communication, remote sensing, information security, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. For these applications, filters with good NIR transparency are typically essential components. Currently, such NIR transparent filters are dominated by inorganic materials such as chalcogenide glasses. There are so far only a handful of organic molecules with suitable optical properties due to the rarity of organic materials with good NIR transparency and relatively flat absorption over the UV&#8208;visible region. Here, we found that the library of NIR transparent organic materials can be expanded by forming a charge transfer complex (CTC) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) molecule which are commercially available. Via regulating the D&#8208;A interaction, the CTC filter shows tunable absorption from the visible to NIR region with a relatively high penetration of NIR radiation (&#8764;80%). The CTC filter can successfully highlight NIR information hidden in a complex environment and allow reading of NIR security images for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Moreover, the CTC filter can be used for viewing protected NIR information with good resolution, and thus provide a convenient tool for different security applications using NIR&#8208;encoded information.

         <title>Superionic Bifunctional Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving superionic conductivity from solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies is presented based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonated styrene) (PS&#8208;3H4S). By incorporating &#8211;OH and &#8211;SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, &#8220;intra&#8208;monomer&#8221; hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the &#8211;SO3&#8211; moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in PS&#8208;3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS&#8208;3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high storage modulus of &#8764;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and could be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium metal batteries.

This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS-3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high storage modulus of &#8764;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and could be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nature&#8208;inspired liquid crystalline systems and interaction of living organisms with liquid crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomaterials, which are substances interacting with biological systems, have been extensively explored to understand living organisms and obtain scientific inspiration (such as biomimetics). However, many aspects of biomaterials have yet to be fully understood. Because liquid crystalline phases are ubiquitously found in biomaterials (e.g., cholesterol, amphiphile, DNA, cellulose, bacteria), therefore, a wide range of research have made attempts to approach unresolved issues with the concept of liquid crystals (LCs). This review presents these studies that address the interactive correlation between biomaterials and LCs. Specifically, we first introduce intrinsic LC behavior of various biomaterials such as DNA, cellulose nanocrystals, and bacteria. Second, we address the dynamics of bacteria in LC media, with focus on how bacteria interact with LCs, and how dynamics of bacteria can be controlled by exploiting the characteristics of LCs. Lastly, we review how the strong correlation between LCs and biomaterials has been leveraged to design a new class of biosensors with additional functionalities (e.g., self&#8208;regulated drug release) that are not available in previous systems. Examples addressed in this review convey the message that the intersection between biomaterials and LCs offers deep insights into fundamental understanding of biomaterials, and provides resources for development of transformative technologies.

         <title>Surface Transformation Enables a Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anode in Nonaqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode is achieved by the surface transformation of Cu substrate in a nonaqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and edge&#8208;to&#8208;center stripping behavior during the plating and stripping processes is revealed by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM).








Abstract
Significant challenges remain in developing rechargeable zinc batteries mainly because of reversibility problems on zinc&#8208;metal anodes. The dendritic growth and hydrogen evolution on zinc electrodes are major obstacles to overcome in developing practical and safe zinc batteries. Here, a dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6% over 300 cycles is realized in a newly designed nonaqueous electrolyte, which comprises an inexpensive zinc salt, zinc acetate, and a green low&#8208;cost solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. Surface transformation on Cu substrate plays a critical role in facilitating the dendrite&#8208;free deposition process, which lowers the diffusion energy barrier of the Zn atoms, leading to a uniform and compact thin film for zinc plating. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy reveals the plating process via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and the stripping process through an edge&#8208;dissolution mechanism. In addition, Zn||Mo6S8 full cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a new opportunity to develop nonaqueous rechargeable zinc batteries.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Microenvironment Engineering of a Single&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction for Promoting Concerted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst with accurate amino&#8208;rich microenvironments around the active sites is uniquely designed to enable efficient CO2 capture and fast proton ferrying during CO2 electroreduction, which achieves concurrent CO production at the cathode and sulfur recovery at the anode with industrial&#8208;level current density and lower energy consumption.








Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for the carbon cycle. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis is designed and developed. (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibit unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, the sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently reveal&#160;that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.

         <title>Tactile Near&#8208;Sensor Analogue Computing for Ultrafast Responsive Artificial Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tactile near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system that integrates a pyramidal pressure sensor array and a flexible memristor array is reported. The system can simultaneously sense and process multiple tactile stimuli without any conversion circuits. Such integration approach enables energy&#8208;efficient near&#8208;sensor analogue computing for ultrafast artificial skin applications.








Abstract
Ultrafast artificial skin enables unprecedented tactile internet applications in prosthetics, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interactions. However, current artificial skin systems that rely on front&#8208;end interface electronics typically perform redundant data transfer and analogue&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversions for decision&#8208;making, causing long latency (milliseconds). Here, a near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system based on a flexible memristor array for artificial skin applications is reported. This system, which seamlessly integrates a tactile sensor array with a flexible hafnium oxide memristor array, can simultaneously sense and compute raw multiple analogue pressure signals without interface electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the system is used for real&#8208;time noise reduction and edge detection of tactile stimuli. One sensing&#8211;computing operation of this system takes about 400&#160;ns and consumes on average 1000 times less power than a conventional interface electronic system. The results demonstrate that near&#8208;sensor analogue computing offers an ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient route to large&#8208;scale artificial skin systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported.

The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual-responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs-700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni-MOFs-700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro-ionic actuations. The dual-responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructure of battery key components plays a central role in guiding the charge transport. By gradient design, optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can be realized and high energy/power supported. Recent processes in the gradient design strategies of cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are presented with future research directions highlighted.








Abstract
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructures of the cathode, anode, and electrolyte play a central role in guiding ion and/or electron transport inside the battery. Rational design of key battery components with varying microstructure along the charge&#8208;transport direction to realize optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can compensate for reaction polarization, which accelerates electrochemical reaction kinetics. Here, the principles of charge&#8208;transport mechanisms and their decisive role in battery performance are presented, followed by a discussion of the correlation between charge&#8208;transport regulation and battery microstructure design. The design strategies of the gradient cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. Future directions and perspectives of gradient design are provided at the end to enable practically accessible high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on the Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number.








Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride (TaIrTe4) is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE). The results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. This study enables on&#8208;chip&#8208;integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Rapid Screen for Antiviral T&#8208;Cell Immunity with Nanowire Electrochemical Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors, a device for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Nanowire devices successfully assess SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells directly from peripheral blood samples of donors, demonstrating potential point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications in rapid detection of antigen&#8208;specific T cells.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly assess and monitor patient immune responses is critical for clinical diagnostics, vaccine design, and fundamental investigations into the presence or generation of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Recently, findings on the limits of antibody&#8208;based protection provided by B&#8208;cells have highlighted the importance of engaging pathogen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells for long&#8208;lasting and broad protection against viruses and their emergent variants such as in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, low&#8208;cost and point&#8208;of&#8208;care tools for detecting engagement of T&#8208;cell immunity in patients are conspicuously lacking in ongoing efforts to assess and control population&#8208;wide disease risk. Currently available tools for human T&#8208;cell analysis are time and resource&#8208;intensive. Using multichannel silicon&#8208;nanowire field&#8208;effect transistors compatible with complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor, a device designed for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses is developed. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1, common and seasonal viruses CMV, EBV, flu, as well as emergent pandemic coronavirus, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Further, this device provides a modular and translational platform for optimizing vaccine formulations and combinations, offering quick and quantitative readouts for acquisition and persistence of T&#8208;cell immunity against variant&#8208;driven pathogens such as flu and pandemic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Structurally Resemblant Dopants Enhance Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient doping strategy is applied to endow bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of dibenzothiophene derivatives. The isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy gap between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states enable bright RTP.








Abstract
Doping has shown very promising potential in endowing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of organic phosphors with minimal effort. Here, a new isomer design and doping strategy is reported that is applicable to dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives. Three isomers are synthesized to study the dopant effect on enhancing RTP of DBT derivatives. It is found that isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to the host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy difference between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states can yield efficient RTP for the doped system. Meanwhile, phosphorescence color from yellow to red is achieved by varying isomer dopants used for doping the DBT derivatives. This work represents an RTP enhancement strategy based on isomer design and doping to construct luminescent organic phosphors.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed for the hardening of piezoelectrics via the mediation of dopant&#8208;exclusive oxygen vacancies to overcome the long&#8208;term issue: the dilemma between the mechanical quality factor and piezoelectricity coefficient. The approach also makes the high&#8208;power performance superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts, offering a possible route to various piezoelectrics for high&#8208;end applications.








Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach, but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here, a new hardening effect associated with isolated oxygen vacancies for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances is proposed. Guided by theoretical design, a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics, where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging, hysteresis measurement, and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis, it is revealed that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the polarization contributions being retained. More encouragingly, the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity, offering potential in material design for practical high&#8208;power applications such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotomes.

         <title>Doping Compensation Enables High&#8208;Detectivity Infrared Organic Photodiodes for Image Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping compensation strategy is utilized to reduce the trap density and to enhance the external quantum efficiency simultaneously, leading to a greatly improved detectivity in infrared organic photodiodes. Consequently, high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density organic photodiodes arrays without pattering sensing layers are successfully applied in image capture.








Abstract
Infrared organic photodiodes have gained increasing attention due to their great application potentials in night vision, optical communication, and all&#8208;weather imaging. However, the commonly occurring high dark current and low detectivity impede infrared photodetectors from portable applications at room temperature. Herein, an efficient and generic doping compensation strategy is developed to improve the detectivity of infrared organic photodiodes. A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is investigated, and it is found that doping compensation strategy not only reduces the trap density of states and dark currents, but also restrains the nonradiative recombination with improved charge transport and collection. As a result, an ultralow noise spectral density of 8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 A Hz&#8722;1/2 as well as a high specific detectivity over 1013 Jones in 780&#8211;1070&#160;nm is achieved at room temperature. More importantly, the high&#8208;performance infrared organic photodiodes can be successfully applied in high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density image arrays without patterning sensing layers. These findings provide important compensation design insights that will be crucial to further improve the performance of infrared organic photodiodes in the future.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Green OLED with 4500 h Lifetime and 20% External Quantum Efficiency by Optimizing the Emission Zone using a Single&#8208;Emission Spectrum Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accessible, fast procedure is shown to measure light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) emission zones with current density, different device structures, and ageing. The emission zone in an organic LED is shown to be controlled by emitter doping and to have a strong relationship with device degradation and lifetime. Using the resulting insights, record stability for a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic LED is shown.








Abstract
Device optimization of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) targets the most efficient conversion of electrically injected charges into emitted light. The emission zone in an LED is where charges recombine and light is emitted from. It is believed that the emission zone is strongly linked to device efficiency and lifetime. However, the emission zone size is below the optical diffraction limit, so it is difficult to measure. An accessible method based on a single emission spectrum that enables emission zone measurements with sub&#8208;second time resolution is shown. A procedure is introduced to study and control the emission zone of an LED system and correlate it with device performance. A thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic LED emission zone is experimentally measured over all luminescing current densities, while varying the device structure and while ageing. The emission zone is shown to be finely controlled by emitter doping because electron transport via the emitter is the charge&#8208;transport bottleneck of the system. Suspected quenching/degradation mechanisms are linked with the emission zone changes, device structure variation, and ageing. Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 h T95 lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.

         <title>Nanoscale Antiferromagnetic Domain Imaging using Full&#8208;Field Resonant X&#8208;ray Magnetic Diffraction Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;field resonant X&#8208;ray magnetic diffraction microscopy enables nanoscale antiferromagnetic domain imaging of large&#8208;area bulk single crystals with very high spatial resolution (&#8776;150 nm) and high throughput. This novel technique visualizes antiferromagnetic domain walls and uncovers hitherto unknown mesoscopic antiferromagnetic structures in the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4.








Abstract
The physical properties of magnetic materials frequently depend not only on the microscopic spin and electronic structures, but also on the structures of mesoscopic length scales that emerge, for instance, from domain formations, or chemical and/or electronic phase separations. However, experimental access to such mesoscopic structures is currently limited, especially for antiferromagnets with net zero magnetization. Here, full&#8208;field microscopy and resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction are combined to visualize antiferromagnetic (AF) domains of the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 with area over &#8776;0.1 mm2 and with spatial resolution as high as &#8776;150&#160;nm. With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolution, an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm is revealed.

&lt;p&gt;Full-field resonant X-ray magnetic diffraction microscopy enables nanoscale antiferromagnetic domain imaging of large-area bulk single crystals with very high spatial resolution (&#8776;150 nm) and high throughput. This novel technique visualizes antiferromagnetic domain walls and uncovers hitherto unknown mesoscopic antiferromagnetic structures in the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical properties of magnetic materials frequently depend not only on the microscopic spin and electronic structures, but also on the structures of mesoscopic length scales that emerge, for instance, from domain formations, or chemical and/or electronic phase separations. However, experimental access to such mesoscopic structures is currently limited, especially for antiferromagnets with net zero magnetization. Here, full-field microscopy and resonant magnetic X-ray diffraction are combined to visualize antiferromagnetic (AF) domains of the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with area over &#8776;0.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and with spatial resolution as high as &#8776;150&#160;nm. With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolution, an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm is revealed. This mesoscopic structure comprises a substantial portion of the sample surface, and thus can result in a macroscopic response unexpected from its microscopic magnetic structure. In particular, the symmetry analysis presented in this work shows that the inversion symmetry, which is preserved by the microscopic AF order, becomes ill-defined at the mesoscopic length scale. This result underscores the importance of this novel technique for a thorough understanding of the physical properties of antiferromagnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Arrays of Topological Solitons in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;Time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological solitons of chiral liquid crystal (LC) are uniformly generated over a large area with periodic air pockets. Controlled thermal phase transition with air pockets enables real&#8208;time observation of morphogenesis of topological solitons transformed from topological defects. The platform provides insight into topological solitons at the other scales and can be applied to multiple applications requiring controlled LC structures.








Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, and occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and timescale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for a model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and timescale. Here, a new&#160;way is found to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric LCs confined in patterned substrates. The experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on minimization of free energy closely reconstructs the experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from the direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Al current collector modified by hierarchical N&#8208;doped carbon and graphdiyne composites is beneficial to reducing the local current density and increasing the potassiophilic sites, accordingly enabling excellent electrochemical performance for dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Employing an Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium&#8208;metal batteries (PMBs). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between the potassium and the planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and, hence, an undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY)&#8208;modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties is proposed, which simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#181;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed with Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, the thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose chains are introduced between MXene sheets to obtain molecular&#8208;level hybrid films with simultaneously enhanced ambient stability and wet strength. The hybrid films also show significantly enhanced actuation strain due to the enlarged layer distance and possible in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene. A hybrid&#8208;based soft actuator shows an unprecedentedly high modulus and a strain difference up to 0.541% under&#160;1&#160;V.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose (MC)/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength, and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#160;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and ex&#160;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/de&#8208;intercalated and MC&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7&#160;times its own weight.

         <title>Engineering a Kesterite&#8208;Based Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from NOx Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a kesterite&#8208;based photocathode (CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4) for selective photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis directly from NOx reduction is established. Synergistically outstanding light&#8208;absorption capability, efficient photogenerated charge transfer, and selective surface catalytic reaction are successfully unified, contributing to maximum 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (at 0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) toward ammonia.








Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by a kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 [CZTS]) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS) is demonstrated. The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (FE) (0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V vs RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8722; and *NO2&#160;intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8722; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Further attempts on PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater show good FE of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using the kesterite&#8208;based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

&lt;/i&gt;/CdS/CZTS) is demonstrated. The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;RR, yielding up to 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (FE) (0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V vs RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species, the adsorption of reactant NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; also suppresses NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; liberation as a by-product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Further attempts on PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater show good FE of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using the kesterite-based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate-rich wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immunoregulation in Diabetic Wound Repair with a Photoenhanced Glycyrrhizic Acid Hydrogel Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a glycyrrhizic acid (GA) hybrid hydrogel is developed as an immunoregulatory scaffold for diabetic wound repair. This hybrid hydrogel consists of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA as a first network and photoenhanced methyl acrylylated silk fibroin as a second network, realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, this hybrid hydrogel could regulate macrophage responses without exogenous addition.








Abstract
M1 macrophage accumulation and excessive inflammation are commonly encountered issues in diabetic wounds and can fail in the healing process. Hence, hydrogel dressings with immunoregulatory capacity have great promise in the clinical practice of diabetic wound healing. However, current immunoregulatory hydrogels are always needed for complex interventions and high&#8208;cost treatments, such as cytokines and cell therapies. In this study, a novel glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;based hybrid hydrogel dressing with intrinsic immunoregulatory properties is developed to promote rapid diabetic wound healing. This hybrid hydrogel consists of interpenetrating polymer networks composed of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA and photo&#8208;crosslinked methyl acrylated silk fibroin (SF), realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, the SF/GA/Zn hybrid hydrogel can regulate macrophage responses in the inflammatory microenvironment, circumventing the use of any additives. The immunomodulatory properties of the hydrogel can be harnessed for safe and efficient therapeutics that accelerate the three phases of wound repair and serve as a promising dressing for the management of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Triggering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single&#8208;Atomic Mo Sites Anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic Mo sites anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxides nanoarrays are prepared, exhibiting superior performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. In&#160;situ characterizations and the theoretical analysis collaboratively reveal that Mo incorporation triggers enhanced metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and improved reactivity of oxygen ligands, leading to feasible lattice oxygen oxidation mechanisms.








Abstract
Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single&#8208;atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In&#160;situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope&#8208;labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single&#8208;atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.

         <title>Giant Negative Magnetoresistance beyond Chiral Anomaly in Topological Material YCuAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is reported in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2. The origin of the negative MR (&#8776;40%) is beyond the &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; mechanism and identified as vacancy&#8208;induced spin&#8208;dependent scattering. This finding suggests a unique way to introduce negative MR in nonmagnetic topological materials through defect engineering.








Abstract
The large negative magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which usually emerges in various magnetic systems, is a technologically important property for spintronics. Recently, the so&#8208;called &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; in topological semimetals offers an alternative to generate a considerable negative MR effect without utilizing magnetism. However, it requires that the applied magnetic field must be strictly along the electric current direction, which sets a strong limit for practical applications. Here, a giant negative MR effect is discovered with a value of up to &#8722;40% in 9 T at 2 K in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2, which is not restricted to the specific configuration for applied magnetic fields. Based on magnetic susceptibility and NMR measurements, the giant negative MR effect is tightly connected with the unexpected spin&#8208;dependent scattering from vacancy&#8208;induced local moments, which is also beyond the classical Kondo effect. The present work not only offers an alternative route for spintronics based on nonmagnetic topological materials, but also helps to further understand the negative MR effect in topological materials.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexing in Space&#8211;Time Thermoacoustic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space&#8211;time thermoacoustic metasurface possess unusual capacities to simultaneously manipulate sound field distributions and harmonic frequency responses. Along this frontier, a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing technique is established with a superposition of vortex beams carrying orthogonal orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum modes at distinct frequency harmonics. The synthesized dimensionality introduces entirely new physics and design philosophies to multiplexing schemes, promising unprecedented functionalities in acoustic communication devices.








Abstract
Multiplexing technology with increased information capacity plays a crucial role in the realm of acoustic communication. Different quantities of sound waves, including time, frequency, amplitude, phase, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), have been independently introduced as the physical multiplexing approach to allow for enhanced communication densities. An acoustic metasurface is decorated with carbon nanotube patches, which when electrically pumped and set to rotate, functions as a hybrid mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexer with synthetic dimensions. Based on this spatiotemporal modulation, a superposition of vortex beams with orthogonal OAMs and symmetric harmonics are both numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Also, flexible combinations of OAM modes with diverse frequency shifts are obtained by transforming the azimuthal phase distributions, which inspires a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing approach that significantly promotes the communication&#160;capacity.

Abstract
Nanozymes, which are inorganic nanomaterials mimicking natural enzyme activities, are bringing enormous opportunities to theranostics. Herein, a cytochrome c oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme (copper&#8211;silver alloy nanoparticle, Cu&#8211;Ag NP) is demonstrated for nanocatalytic cancer therapy. Loaded with bioreductive predrug (AQ4N), this Cu&#8211;Ag nanozyme unprecedentedly enables simultaneous starvation, ferroptosis, and chemical therapy with high specificity, and is able to totally eliminate tumor and greatly prolong the survival rate for 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by a Directly Grown Graphene&#8208;Modulated Aluminum Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup integrated with a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration, a commercial Al foil is elaborately decorated with a graphene layer with strong adhesion and high surface energy, which enables a smooth and highly reversible K plating/stripping process. An anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell using the as&#8208;synthesized substrate as the anode current collector displays improved performance.








Abstract
Potassium (K)&#8208;metal batteries have emerged as a promising energy&#8208;storage device owing to abundant K resources. An anode&#8208;free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene&#8208;modified layer (Al@G) through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m&#8722;1) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m&#8722;2), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K&#8208;metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a novel anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Photothermally Triggered &#8220;Oxygen Bomb&#8221; for Hypoxic Tumor Programmed Cascade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally triggered oxygen release vehicle PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D for hypoxic tumor treatment, NIR&#8208;II extinction photothermal&#8208;agent gold nanorods are fabricated on the surface of an oxygenated polymer nanocapsule through an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth strategy. Under a customized programmed cascade therapy, superior hypoxic tumor suppression is achieved under mild conditions.








Abstract
Hypoxia, as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) is reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy&#8208;conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of the polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2&#160;release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. First, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2&#160;infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is used to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy will provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.

         <title>General Synthesis and Solution Processing of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose, can be employed for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. The good solution dispersibility and membrane formability of MOF nanofibers surpass traditional MOF powder materials, which facilitates their processing and application.








Abstract
By virtue of their extraordinarily high surface areas, ordered pore structures, various compositions, and rich functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest in diverse fields such as gas separation, sensing, catalysis, energy, environment science, and biomedicine. However, the difficulty in processing MOF crystals and controlling the MOF superstructure is emerging as a critical issue in their application. Herein, it is reported that a robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), can be used for the synthesis of MOF materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. NFC@MOF core&#8211;shell nanofibers with a uniform network structure and high aspect ratios can be prepared by use of this template. The small crystal size, flexibility, and good dispersity of the NFC@MOF nanofibers make it convenient for the macroscale assembly and solution processing of MOF materials. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is demonstrated wherein freestanding MOF nanofiber membranes represent good performance in applications of water treatment and heterogeneous catalysis reaction. This general synthesis and solution&#8208;processing strategy may herald a new era in promoting the industrial application of MOFs.

         <title>Robust Artificial Interphases Constructed by a Versatile Protein&#8208;Based Binder for High&#8208;Voltage Na&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA) binder is developed, which shows enhanced ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase to help stabilize the cathode electrolyte interface, protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling.








Abstract
The multiple issues of unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases, sluggish reaction kinetics, and transition&#8208;metal (TM) dissolution have long greatly affected the rate and cycling performance of cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a multifunctional protein&#8208;based binder, sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA), is developed, which shows intriguing physiochemical properties to address these issues. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase on the high&#8208;voltage Na4Mn2Fe(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material (NMFPP). Through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, it is shown that the SP/PAA binder is electrochemically stable at high voltages and possesses increased ionic conductivity due to the interaction between sericin and electrolyte anion ClO4&#8722;, which can provide additional sodium&#8208;migration paths with greatly reduced energy barriers. Besides, the strong interaction force between the binder and the NMFPP can effectively protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, stabilize crystal structure, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling. Benefiting from these merits, the SP/PAA&#8208;based NMFPP electrode displays enhanced rate and cycling performance. Of note, the universality of the SP/PAA binder is further confirmed on Na3V2(PO4)2F3. It is believed that the versatile protein&#8208;based binder is enlightening for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

Benefiting from these merits, the SP/PAA-based NMFPP electrode displays enhanced rate and cycling performance. Of note, the universality of the SP/PAA binder is further confirmed on Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is believed that the versatile protein-based binder is enlightening for the development of high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8211;graphite battery in an anode&#8208;free configuration is demonstrated, which is enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping on a zincophilic Ag coating and anion intercalation&#8211;deintercalation. The constructed cell exhibits long cycling life of over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 82% and high specific energy of 79&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free battery concept is&#160;proposed to pursue the aspiration of energy&#8208;dense, rechargeable metal batteries, but this has not been achieved with dual&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the first anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite battery enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping onto a silver&#8208;coated Cu substrate is demonstrated. The silver coating guides uniform Zn deposition without dendrite formation or side reaction over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations, enabling the construction of anode&#8208;free Zn cells. In addition, the graphite cathode operates efficiently under reversible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) intercalation without anodic corrosion. An extra high&#8208;potential TFSI&#8722; intercalation plateau is recognized at 2.75&#160;V, contributing to the high capacity of graphite cathode. Thanks to efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping and TFSI&#8722; intercalation&#8211;deintercalation, an anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite dual&#8208;ion battery that exhibits impressive cycling stability with 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles is constructed. At the same time, a specific energy of 79&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of cathode and electrolyte is achieved, which is over two times higher than conventional Zn&#8211;graphite batteries (&lt;30&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Ligand Strategy to Regulate the Nucleation and Growth of Lead Chromate Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;ligand growth strategy in fabricating high&#8208;quality PbCrO4 thin film is demonstrated by slowing down crystal growth and inducing faster heterogeneous nucleation during annealing process. The dual&#8208;ligand strategy can effectively improve crystallinity, reduce defect density, and subsequently boosts superior charge separation efficiency up to &#8776;90%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for renewable hydrogen production has been regarded as a promising solution to utilize solar energy. However, most photoelectrodes still suffer from poor film quality and poor charge separation properties, mainly owing to the possible formation of detrimental defects including microcracks and grain boundaries. Herein, a molecular coordination engineering strategy is developed by employing acetylacetone (Acac) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dual ligands to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of the lead chromate (PbCrO4) photoanode, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;quality film with large grain size, well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries, and reduced oxygen vacancies defects. With these efforts, the nonradiative charge recombination is efficiently suppressed, leading to the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency from 47% to 90%. After decorating with Co&#8211;Pi cocatalyst, the PbCrO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V (vs RHE under simulated AM1.5G) and an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.82%. This work provides a new strategy to modulate the nucleation and growth of high&#8208;quality photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.

         <title>Synergistic Cr2O3@Ag Heterostructure Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3@Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits superb selectivity, activity, and stability toward CO2 reduction to CO, resulting from the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels has been recognized as a promising means to reduce the reliance on fossil resources; it is, however, hindered due to the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. The effectiveness of sculpturing metal/metal oxides (MMO) heterostructures to enhance electrocatalytic performance toward CO2RR has been well documented, nonetheless, the precise synergistic mechanism of MMO remains elusive. Herein, an in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst (Cr2O3@Ag) is reported for efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The obtained Cr2O3@Ag can readily achieve a superb FECO of 99.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs RHE) with a high JCO of 19.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. These studies also confirm that the operando synthesized Cr2O3@Ag possesses high operational stability. Notably, operando Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that the markedly enhanced performance is attributable to the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates. DFT calculations unveil that the metallic&#8208;Ag&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to CO requires a 1.45&#160;eV energy input to proceed, which is 0.93&#160;eV higher than that of the MMO&#8208;structured Cr2O3@Ag. The exemplified approaches in this work would be adoptable for design and development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for other important reactions.

         <title>Dangling Octahedra Enable Edge States in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lived edge states of 2D lead halide perovskites arise from the rotational symmetry elevation at the crystal layer edges, which are enabled by dangling PbBr6 octahedra at the lattice terminals. These dangling octahedra with enhanced atomic vibrations can give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective electron transport from the interior to layer edges.








Abstract
The structural reconstruction at the crystal layer edges of 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) leads to unique edge states (ES), which are manifested by prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced emission energy. These special ES&#160;can effectively enhance the optoelectronic performance of devices, but their intrinsic origin and working mechanism remain elusive. Here it is demonstrated that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper LHPs [BA2CsPb2Br7, BA2MAPb2Br7, and BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr6 octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the interior states and the ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which can stimulate the exploration of ES&#8208;based exotic optoelectronic properties and the corresponding design of high&#8208;performance devices for these emergent low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors.

Here it is demonstrated that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper LHPs [BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MAPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, and BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (BA &lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; butylammonium; MA &lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the interior states and the ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which can stimulate the exploration of ES-based exotic optoelectronic properties and the corresponding design of high-performance devices for these emergent low-dimensional semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemical instability within conventional hybrid perovskites is addressed using inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;based systems. A novel &#947;&#8208;CsPb1&#8722;xTbx(IBr)3 perovskite is fabricated with the help of bulk and surface passivation methods, the combination of which ensures ambient&#8208;processed and stable inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells that produce 19% power conversion efficiency with &gt;90%&#160;thermal&#8208;stability over 300 h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Realizing photoactive and thermodynamically stable all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains a challenging task within halide perovskite photovoltaic (PV) research. Here, a dual strategy for realizing efficient inorganic mixed halide perovskite PV devices based on a terbium&#8208;doped solar absorber, that is, CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br, is reported, which undertakes a bulk and surface passivation treatment in the form of CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br quantum dots, to maintain a photoactive &#947;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions and with significantly improved operational stability. Devices fabricated from these air&#8208;processed perovskite thin films exhibit an air&#8208;stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) that reaches 17.51% (small&#8208;area devices) with negligible hysteresis and maintains &gt;90%&#160;of the initial efficiency when operating for 600 h under harsh environmental conditions, stemming from the combined effects of the dual&#8208;protection strategy. This approach is further examined within large&#8208;area PSC modules (19.8 cm2 active area) to realize 10.94% PCE and &gt;30&#160;days ambient stability, as well as within low&#8208;bandgap &#947;&#8208;CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2.5Br0.5 (Eg&#160;= 1.73&#160;eV) materials, yielding 19.01% (18.43% certified) PCE.

In&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, NFMO with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V).








Abstract
The layered sodium transition metal oxide, NaTMO2 (TM = transition metal), with a binary or ternary phases has displayed outstanding electrochemical performance as a new class of strategy cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an in&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, Na0.76Ni0.20Fe0.40Mn0.40O2 with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. Structural visualization on an atomic scale is also provided and the following findings are unveiled: i) the existence of a mixed&#8208;phase intergrowth layer distribution and unequal distribution of P2 and O3 phases along two different crystal plane indices and ii) a complete reversible charge/discharge process for the initial two cycles that displays a simple phase transformation, which is unprecedented. Moreover, first&#8208;principles calculations support the evidence of the formation of a binary NFMO&#8208;P2/O3 compound, over the proposed hypothetical monophasic structures (O3, P3, O&#8242;3, and P2 phases). As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V). It is believed that the insightful understanding of the proposed materials can introduce new perspectives for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Construction of N, P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphidation strategy is discovered for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined Fe single atoms&#8211;Fe2P nanoparticles/N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames catalyst, and a new concept of &#8220;atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers&#8221; for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is put forward.








Abstract
A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>A Bionic Interface to Suppress the Coffee&#8208;Ring Effect for Reliable and Flexible Perovskite Modules with a Near&#8208;90% Yield Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a superhydrophilic bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) significantly suppresses the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing of large&#8208;area perovskite films via regulating the nucleation rate (&#965;N) and radial transport rate (&#965;RT) of the perovskite precursor, which induces a homogeneous large&#8208;area flexible perovskite film and high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.08%.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity, poor interfacial contact, and pinholes caused by the coffee&#8208;ring effect severely affect the printing reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inspired by the bio&#8208;glue of barnacles, a bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) of NiOx/levodopa is introduced to suppress the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing perovskite modules. The coordination effect of the sticky functional groups in Bio&#8208;IL can pin the three&#8208;phase contact line and restrain the transport of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing and evaporation process. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of perovskite precursor is accelerated due to the electrostatic attraction and rapid volatilization from an extraordinary wettability. The superhydrophilic Bio&#8208;IL affords an even spread over a large&#8208;area substrate, which boosts a complete and uniform liquid film for heterogeneous nucleation as well as crystallization. Perovskite films on different large&#8208;area substrates with negligible coffee&#8208;ring effect are printed. Consequently, inverted flexible PSCs and perovskite solar modules achieve a high efficiency of 21.08% and 16.87%, respectively. This strategy ensures a highly reliable reproducibility of printing PSCs with a near 90% yield rate.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Environment Tactile Sensing System: Toward Simple and Efficient Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent triboelectric tactile sensing system is proposed that combines triboelectric nanogenerator technology and deep&#8208;learning technology. Independent of touch conditions and external environmental conditions, the tactile sensing system can achieve accurate, simple, and real&#8208;time material identification.








Abstract
Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines a TENG and deep&#8208;learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. The tactile sensing system is exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real&#8208;time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.

         <title>Mesopore&#8208;Rich Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst with FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NC Single&#8208;Atom Sites Delivers Remarkable Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance in Alkaline Media</title>

         <dc:description>
An Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeN4&#8208;O&#8211;NCR) based on O,N&#8208;codoped carbon nanorods delivers remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in a primary zinc&#8211;air battery. The Fe atoms in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR are coordinated by four in&#8208;plane N atoms and a subsurface axial oxygen atom that bridge between N&#8208;doped graphene sheets, thus optimizing the Fe d&#8208;band center position and binding energies of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. With a view toward boosting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe single&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, fine&#8208;tuning the local coordination of the Fe sites to optimize the binding energies of ORR intermediates is imperative. Herein, a porous FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR electrocatalyst rich in catalytically accessible FeN4&#8211;O sites (wherein the Fe single atoms are coordinated to four in&#8208;plane nitrogen atoms and one subsurface axial oxygen atom) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NCR) is reported. Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verifies the presence of FeN4&#8211;O active sites in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR, while density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN4&#8211;O coordination offers a lower energy and more selective 4&#8208;electron/4&#8208;proton ORR pathway compared to traditional FeN4 sites. Electrochemical tests validate the outstanding intrinsic activity of FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR for alkaline ORR, outperforming Pt/C and almost all other M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts reported to date. A primary zinc&#8211;air battery constructed using FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR delivers a peak power density of 214.2&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 334.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, highlighting the benefits of optimizing the local coordination of iron single atoms.

         <title>A Transparent, High&#8208;Performance, and Stable Sb2S3 Photoanode Enabled by Heterojunction Engineering with Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks for Unbiased Photoelectrochemical Overall Water Splitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole framework onto the surface of transparent Sb2S3 thin film creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction, leading to a transparent, high&#8208;performance, and stable hybrid photoanode. When coupled with a bandgap&#8208;matched back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode, the unbiased photoelectrochemical tandem device demonstrates an unprecedented efficiency of 5.21% toward solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting.








Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable photoanodes is essential in solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) energy conversion. Sb2S3 is a low&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.7&#160;eV) n&#8208;type semiconductor with a maximum theoretical solar conversion efficiency of &#8776;28% for PEC water splitting. However, bulk Sb2S3 exhibits opaque characteristics and suffers from severe photocorrosion, and thus the use of Sb2S3 as a photoanode material remains underexploited. This study describes the design and fabrication of a transparent Sb2S3&#8208;based photoanode by conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPF&#8208;TCzB) onto the Sb2S3 film. This structural design creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction between the CPF&#8208;TCzB and the Sb2S3 with a suitable band&#8208;edge energy offset, thereby, greatly enhancing the charge separation efficiency. The CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 hybrid photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 10.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the thin CPF&#8208;TCzB overlayer effectively inhibits photocorrosion of the Sb2S3 and enables long&#8208;term operation for at least 100&#160;h with &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent density. Furthermore, a standalone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising a CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 photoanode and a back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode can achieve a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.21%, representing the most efficient PEC water splitting device of its kind.

         <title>Directing Charge Transfer in a Chemical&#8208;Bonded BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky Heterojunction for Piezoelectric Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BaTiO3@ReS2&#160;piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system with interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond exhibits excellent synergy between piezoelectric and photocatalytic. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric response can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons. The interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond ensures the formation of a seamless contact interface and acts as the &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the electron transfer.








Abstract
The piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system, which can utilize solar energy and mechanical energy simulteneously, is promising but still challenging in the environmental remediation field. In this work, a novel metal&#8211;semiconductor BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky heterostructure is designed and it shows high&#8208;efficiency on piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation. By combining experiment and calculation results, the distorted metal&#8208;phase ReS2 nanosheets are found to be closely anchored on the surface of the BaTiO3 nanorods, through interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bonds. The Schottky heterostructure not only forms electron&#8208;transfer channels but also exhibits enhanced oxygen activation capacity, which are helpful to produce more superoxide radicals. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric BaTiO3 can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons directing to the ReS2. As a result of the synergy effect between the two components, the BaTiO3@ReS2 exhibits untrahigh activity for degradation of pollutants with an apparent rate constant of 0.133 min&#8722;1 for piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis, which is 16.6 and 2.44 times as that of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, respectively. This performance is higher than most reported BaTiO3&#8208;based piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis systems. This work paves the way for the design of high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation through using green energies in nature.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;Red OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 36.1% and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of narrowband red emitters with superb photophysical properties is developed by way of novel B/N/O&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance structures. The red OLEDs incorporating these emitters sensitized by the phosphor display state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with EQE exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off, ultrahigh brightness, and good device lifetime.








Abstract
High&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, a series of novel red MR emitters is reported by para&#8208;positioning N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N, O&#8211;&#960;&#8211;O, B&#8211;&#960;&#8211;B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct an MR central core. These emitters can be facilely and modularly synthesized, allowing for easy fine&#8208;tuning of emission spectra by peripheral groups. Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (kr) up to 7.4 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), ultrahigh brightness over 130&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, together with good device lifetime.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric substitution of terminal groups is first applied in small&#8208;molecule donors. A record efficiency of 16.34% is achieved for binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells. A unique phenomenon of merits integration is reported rather than the balance between Voc and Jsc, which is generally observed in asymmetric substitution of nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 and 3.39 D, respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;circuit current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction mainly dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of the fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility. These results well explain the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

Human T&#8208;Cell Analysis
Researchers at Yale University have designed a new blood test for rapid electronic detection of T&#8208;cell immunity in humans using silicon nanowire arrays. In article number 2109661, Mohsen Nami, Richard Edelson, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a novel device in near&#8208;instantaneous assessment of individual immunity against COVID&#8208;19, and describe potential applications as a Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care tool for screening vaccine responses or monitoring patient immunity in cancer, autoimmunity, and infectious diseases.

Photodetectors
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 is designed by Dong Sun and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201229 to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current whose magnitude is proportional to the OAM mode number. This detector can be integrated into a focal plane array that can resolve multiple optical parameters of a target.

Thermoacoustic Metasurfaces
In article number 2202026, Ying Cheng, Xiaojun Liu, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers report an orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing technology based on space&#8208;time thermoacoustic metasurfaces for enhanced communication densities. In analogy to the Chinese story &#8220;Monkey King Prays for Rain&#8221;, multifaceted weather signals, i.e, lightning, thunder and rain, etc., are synchronously transmitted through multipath orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum beams.

Topological Soliton Arrays
In article number 2201749, Ivan Smalyukh, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers report a new way to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric liquid crystals confined in patterned substrates. The line textures are cholesteric fingers of the third kind (CF&#8208;3s), in which 1D topological solitons called twist walls are stabilized by two twist disclination lines, which are nucleated and grown from the air pockets on the top view. This image represents that the CF&#8208;3s array is formed like an infinite maze.

         <title>Targeting the Microenvironment of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaques: An Emerging Diagnosis and Therapy Strategy for Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the characteristics of the microenvironment of vulnerable plaques, nanomedicine targeting strategies for assessing plaque vulnerability by imaging are systematically summarized, developments in construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents to boost the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy are highlighted, and existing challenges and prospects in the fields of diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis based on nanomaterials are discussed.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significance in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents are designed and have drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, the characteristics of vulnerable plaques are generalized, and some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.) are systematically summarized. In addition, existing challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, and it is believed to provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

         <dc:description>
The key and emerging development of promising materials for CO2 capture, catalytic conversion, and direction utilization is presented in this authoritative, comprehensive, and critical review. The promises of advanced dual&#8208;functional materials for integrated capture and in situ conversion and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven smart material study are particularly highlighted. This review can serve as a guide to sustainable CO2&#8208;management schemes.








Abstract
With the rising level of atmospheric CO2 worsening climate change, a promising global movement toward carbon neutrality is forming. Sustainable CO2 management based on carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has garnered considerable interest due to its critical role in resolving emission&#8208;control and energy&#8208;supply challenges. Here, a comprehensive review is presented that summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in developing promising materials for sustainable CO2 management in terms of not only capture, catalytic conversion (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and possible combinations), and direct utilization, but also emerging integrated capture and in situ conversion as well as artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven smart material study. In particular, insights that span multiple scopes of material research are offered, ranging from mechanistic comprehension of reactions, rational design and precise manipulation of key materials (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, zeolites, ionic liquids), to industrial implementation. This review concludes with a summary and new perspectives, especially from multiple aspects of society, which summarizes major difficulties and future potential for implementing advanced materials and technologies in sustainable CO2 management. This work may serve as a guideline and road map for developing CCU material systems, benefiting both scientists and engineers working in this growing and potentially game&#8208;changing area.

         <title>Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 29, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light&#8208;absorption efficiency and high carrier&#8208;recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.








Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable&#8208;electronic&#8208;structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, perspectives on the challenges for future strain&#8208;promoted photocatalysis are discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.

         <title>Planar Optical Cavities Hybridized with Low&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials have been actively investigated due to their unprecedented optical and optoelectronic properties that are not observed in their bulk forms. However, the emission from low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials is generally weak and difficult to use in nanophotonic devices without being amplified and engineered by optical cavities. Along with studies on various planar optical cavities over the last decade, the physics of cavity&#8208;emitter interactions as well as various integration methods have been investigated deeply. These integrations not only enhance the light&#8208;matter interaction of the emitters, but also provide opportunities for realizing nanophotonic devices based on the new physics allowed by low&#8208;dimensional emitters. In this review, we first provide the fundamentals and strengths and weaknesses of various planar optical resonators. Then, commonly used low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials such as zero&#8208;dimensional emitters (quantum dots and upconversion nanoparticles) and two&#8208;dimensional emitters (transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide and hexagonal boron nitride) are discussed. We explain the integration of these emitters and cavities and the expect interplay between them in the following chapters. Finally, we provide a comprehensive discussion and outlook of nanoscale cavity&#8208;emitter integrated systems.

         <title>Anhydrous Fast Proton Transport Boosted by the Hydrogen Bond Network in a Dense Oxide&#8208;Ion Array of &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic property of inserted charge carriers in a battery electrode dominates the power density of the system. In this work, the fast proton&#8208;transfer mechanism in the unique dense framework of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is decoded. The hydrogen bond network boosts the proton transport and thus realizes a proton battery with high rate capabilities and long life.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of the proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high&#8208;power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, similar continuous hydrogen bond networks in a dense oxide&#8208;ion array of solid &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are discovered, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is unveiled using both experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a superconcentrated Zn2+/H+ electrolyte, the proton&#8208;transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO3&#8211;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8211;discharge abilities.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor lubrication is developed to reduce the adhesion of water drops, even ice, on the surface. The results demonstrate a significantly lower limit departure drop size, and higher water harvesting efficiency. Potential applications in drop manipulation and deicing are also shown.








Abstract
Fast removal of small water drops from surfaces is a challenging issue in heat transfer, water collection, or anti&#8208;icing. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes show good prospects to reach this goal because of their low adhesion to liquids. To further reduce adhesion of water drops, here, the surface to the vapor of organic solvents such as toluene or n&#8208;hexane is exposed. In the presence of such vapors, water drops slide at lower tilt angle and move faster. This is mainly caused by the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes, which serves as a lubricating layer. Enhanced by the toluene vapor lubrication, the limit departure volume of water drop on PDMS brushes decreases by one order of magnitude compared to that in air. As a result, the water harvesting efficiency in toluene vapor increases by 65%. Benefits of vapor lubrication are further demonstrated for de&#8208;icing: driven by gravity, frozen water drops slide down the vertical PDMS brush surface in the presence of vapor.

         <title>A Seawater&#8208;Corrosion&#8208;Resistant and Isotropic Zero Thermal Expansion (Zr,Ta)(Fe,Co)2 Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys are challenged by other environmental instabilities beyond the dimensional stability. Here, a ZTE alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is studied, which shows multiple stabilities, including dimensional stability (ZTE, &#945;l&#160;= 0.21(&#177;2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1 from 5 to 360 K), shape stability (isotropic), cycling stability, and environmental stability.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys as dimensionally stable materials are usually challenged by harsh environmental erosion, since ZTE and corrosion resistance are generally mutually exclusive. Here, a high&#8208;performance alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is reported, that shows isotropic ZTE behavior (&#945;l&#160;= 0.21(2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) in a wide temperature range of 5&#8211;360 K, high corrosion resistance in a seawater&#8208;like solution compared with classic Invar and stainless Invar, and excellent cyclic thermal and structural stabilities. Such stabilities are attributed to the cubic symmetry, the controllable magnetic order, and the spontaneously formed passive film with Ta and Zr chemical modifications. The results are evidenced by X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry investigations. Such multiple stabilities have the potential to broaden the robust applications of ZTE alloys, especially in marine services.

         <title>Recent Advances in Encapsulation of Flexible Bioelectronic Implants: Materials, Technologies, and Characterization Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art and recent advances in encapsulations of flexible bioelectronic chronic implants are reviewed. The materials, deposition and application technologies, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization methods are described in detail. Smart encapsulations integrated into microfabrication, patterned, and actively interacting with the surrounding tissues are also highlighted.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implantable systems (BIS) targeting biomedical and clinical research should combine long&#8208;term performance and biointegration in vivo. Here, recent advances in novel encapsulations to protect flexible versions of such systems from the surrounding biological environment are reviewed, focusing on material strategies and synthesis techniques. Considerable effort is put on thin&#8208;film encapsulation (TFE), and specifically organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer architectures as a flexible and conformal alternative to conventional rigid cans. TFE is in direct contact with the biological medium and thus must exhibit not only biocompatibility, inertness, and hermeticity but also mechanical robustness, conformability, and compatibility with the manufacturing of microfabricated devices. Quantitative characterization methods of the barrier and mechanical performance of the TFE are reviewed with a particular emphasis on water&#8208;vapor transmission rate through electrical, optical, or electrochemical principles. The integrability and functionalization of TFE into functional bioelectronic interfaces are also discussed. TFE represents a must&#8208;have component for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic implants with diagnostic or therapeutic functions in human healthcare and precision medicine.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Conversion and Storage with an Activity&#8208;Regulated Redox Flow Cell via a Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational regulation on the activities of redox couples at different temperatures has been demonstrated as an effective method to boost thermoelectric conversion in thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) systems. This TREC system operates on a pair of reversible electrochemical reactions accompanying thermally&#8208;induced phase transitions during charging and discharging, which significantly boosts the thermoelectric performance of a TREC system.








Abstract
Efficient and cost&#8208;effective technologies are highly desired to convert the tremendous amount of low&#8208;grade waste heat to electricity. Although the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) has attracted increasing attention recently, the unsatisfactory thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion efficiency and low power density limit its practical applications. In this work, a thermosensitive Nernstian&#8208;potential&#8208;driven strategy in the TREC system is demonstrated to boost its temperature coefficient, power density, and thermoelectric conversion efficiency by rationally regulating the activities of redox couples at different temperatures. With a Zn anode and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;guanidinium as the catholyte, the TREC flow cell presents an unprecedented average temperature coefficient of &#8722;3.28&#160;mV K&#8722;1, and achieves an absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 25.1% and apparent thermoelectric efficiency of 14.9% relative to the Carnot efficiency in the temperature range of 25&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a thermoelectric power density of 1.98&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2 is demonstrated, which is more than 7 times the highest power density of reported TREC systems. This activity regulation strategy can inspire research into high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;power TREC devices for practical low&#8208;grade heat harnessing.

This activity regulation strategy can inspire research into high-efficiency and high-power TREC devices for practical low-grade heat harnessing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of a Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic accelerator effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in an electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve the kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions, thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries with high energy efficiency and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy&#8208;storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage, and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein, a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is utilized as a model to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. The resulting MnO2&#8211;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles with energy density retention of 90%, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries. This comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection Using One&#8208;Dimensional Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>

Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and was proved to be instable in atmosphere and detrimental to the working performance of MAPbI3&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. However, the influence of water molecules on the behavior of excitons and charges is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN), we design and successfully synthesize a stable perovskitoid hydrate single crystal, which is a novel quasi one&#8208;dimensional (1D) crystalline structure that can be formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this crystalline hydrate, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity were adopted and water molecules are connected with the molecule through hydrogen bonding. We discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains of the 1D single crystal function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. The threshold photon energy to overcome this potential well is not within the absorption spectrum of the material, avoiding disturbance by the ground&#8208;state molecular absorption and enabling precise determination of the photophysical mechanism. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8208;stock&#8208;releasing&#8208;transport roadmap for the crystalline perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endorses this material more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, we report a reconfigurable, multiple negative differential resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. We verify reconfigurability in terms of the function of MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

         <title>Red Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 25% Realized by Cospacer Cations</title>

Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) own great attention in recent years, due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important part for lighting and display. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskite could deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Here, we finely control the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduce the amount of smaller n index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs showed 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibit the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

         <title>Structure/Interface Coupling Effect for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) is widely applied in today's rechargeable battery markets for consumer electronic devices. However, LCO operations at high voltage are hindered by accelerated structure degradation and electrode/electrolyte interface decomposition. To overcome these challenges, co&#8208;modified LCO that couples pillar structures with interface shielding are successfully synthesized for achieving high energy density and structurally stable cathode material. Benefitting from the &#8220;Mg&#8208;pillar&#8221; effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li+ shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO and amorphous CoxBy coating layer were found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects is also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enabled a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. Our findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serve to guide future cathode material design.

To overcome these challenges, co-modified LCO that couples pillar structures with interface shielding are successfully synthesized for achieving high energy density and structurally stable cathode material. Benefitting from the &#8220;Mg-pillar&#8221; effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB-Mg-LCO and amorphous Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; coating layer were found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects is also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enabled a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as-designed CB-Mg-LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut-off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. Our findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serve to guide future cathode material design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nano Precipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrahigh precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric was designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33, (8&#215;10&#8211;16 m2/V2) was achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in&#8208;situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it was observed that such superior electrostrictive properties could be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nano precipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nano precipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in reported literatures. Herein, we report for the first time on an unusual but interesting phenomenon that tellurium nanowires (Te NWs) behave negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from UV to VIS&#8208;IR region. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Besides, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs are also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8208;Au heterojunction system. The hot electrons injection on the Te&#8208;Au heterojunction interface induces more obvious tendency to behave negative photoresponse. These findings will benefit the potential applications of Te NWs&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials non&#8208;adiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phase which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the non&#8208;equilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, we&#160;review some of recent progresses of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials. Specifically we&#160;discuss the new development in detection of Higgs mode and photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electron transfer process during oxygen evolution reaction often either proceed solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike AEM, LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8208;oxygen (O&#8208;O) bond. As a result, such process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, i.e., O&#8208;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts were able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, the perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts will also be provided.

         <title>Magnetic Microswarm and Fluoroscopy&#8208;Guided Platform for Biofilm Eradication in Biliary Stents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proposed magnetic microswarm, consisting of urchin&#8208;like MUCR@MLMD, with controlled motility on a curved surface, restricted space accessibility, and swarm enhancement effects is expected to be of great value in treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical implants in situ. Moreover, a fluoroscopy&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided microswarm with rapid endoscopic delivery is demonstrated for biofilm eradication deep inside the body with high time efficiency.








Abstract
Biofilm eradication from medical implants is of fundamental importance, and the treatment of biofilm&#8208;associated pathogen infections on inaccessible biliary stents remains challenging. Magnetically driven microrobots with controlled motility, accessibility to the tiny lumen, and swarm enhancement effects can physically disrupt the deleterious biostructures while not developing drug resistance. Magnetic urchin&#8208;like capsule robots (MUCRs) loaded with magnetic liquid metal droplets (MLMDs, antibacterial agents) are designed using natural sunflower pollen, and the therapeutic effect of swarming MUCR@MLMDs is explored for eradicating complex mixtures of bacterial biofilm within biliary stents collected from patients. The external magnetic field triggers the emergence of the microswarm and induces MLMDs to transform their shape into spheroids and rods with sharp edges. The inherent natural microspikes of MUCRs and the obtained sharp edges of MLMDs actively rupture the dense biological matrix and multiple species of embedded bacterial cells by exerting mechanical force, finally achieving synergistic biofilm eradication. The microswarm is precisely and rapidly deployed into the biliary stent via endoscopy in 10 min. Notably, fluoroscopy imaging is used to track and navigate the locomotion of microswarm in biliary stents in real&#8208;time. The microswarm has great potential for treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical&#160;implants.

         <title>Lasing Action from Quasi&#8208;Propagating Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic nanoparticle lattices integrated with perovskite nanocrystal gain can support quasi&#8208;propagating modes that lase over a continuous range of wavelengths and angles simultaneously. Quasi&#8208;propagating modes consist of uniaxially&#8208;confined standing waves that propagate along high symmetry directions of the lattice. Lasing via quasi&#8208;propagating modes is now generalizable, with characteristics determined by different gain bandwidths and lattice periodicities and geometries.








Abstract
Band edges at the high symmetry points in reciprocal space of periodic structures hold special interest in materials engineering for their high density of states. In optical metamaterials, standing waves found at these points have facilitated lasing, bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum, and Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. However, because high symmetry points by definition are localized, properties associated with them are limited to specific energies and wavevectors. Conversely, quasi&#8208;propagating modes along the high symmetry directions are predicted to enable similar phenomena over a continuum of energies and wavevectors. Here, quasi&#8208;propagating modes in 2D nanoparticle lattices are shown to support lasing action over a continuous range of wavelengths and symmetry&#8208;determined directions from a single device. Using lead halide perovskite nanocrystal films as gain materials, lasing is achieved from waveguide&#8208;surface lattice resonance (W&#8208;SLR) modes that can be decomposed into propagating waves along high symmetry directions, and standing waves in the orthogonal direction that provide optical feedback. The characteristics of the lasing beams are analyzed using an analytical 3D model that describes diffracted light in 2D lattices. Demonstrations of lasing across different wavelengths and lattice designs highlight how quasi&#8208;propagating modes offer possibilities to engineer chromatic multibeam emission important in hyperspectral 3D sensing, high&#8208;bandwidth Li&#8208;Fi communication, and laser projection displays.

Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, we report a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel and an Internet terminal for directly analyzing 5 bladder tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for trace proteins identification in complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, our device could identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;BC individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for the commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This could be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8208;tellurium (K&#8208;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in&#8208;situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode was realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and stable K metal anode at large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8208;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25 mAh cm&#8211;2 at &#8208;40&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Growth of B5&#8208;site&#8208;rich Ru Nanoparticles Guided by Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ruthenium is one of the most active catalysts for ammonia dehydrogenation and is essential for the use of ammonia as a hydrogen storage material. The B5&#8208;type site on the surface of ruthenium is expected to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation, but the number of these sites is typically low. Here, we synthesize a B5&#8208;site&#8208;rich ruthenium catalyst by exploiting the crystal symmetry of a hexagonal boron nitride support. In the prepared ruthenium catalyst, ruthenium nanoparticles are formed epitaxially on hexagonal boron nitride sheets with hexagonal planar morphologies, in which the B5 sites predominate along the nanoparticle edges. By activating the catalyst under the reaction condition, the population of B5 sites further increases as the facets of the ruthenium nanoparticles develop. The electron density of the Ru nanoparticles also increases during catalyst activation. The synthesized catalyst shows superior catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation compared to previously reported catalysts. This work demonstrates that morphology control of a catalyst via support&#8208;driven heteroepitaxy can be exploited for synthesizing highly active heterogeneous catalysts with tailored atomic structures.

Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of small molecules, such as CO2, O2, and H2O, has received significant attention as a potential engine for sustainable life. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of electrocatalytic materials for such processes. An attractive aspect of utilizing this class of materials as electrocatalysts is that well&#8208;known molecular active sites can be introduced to well&#8208;defined crystalline heterogeneous catalytic systems with high tunability. This Review offers strategic insights into recent studies on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts by discussing the notable active sites that have been utilized in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, while highlighting instances where such active sites have been introduced into MOFs. In addition, we outline material design principles enabling the integration of electrochemically active components with the MOF platform. Viewpoints on the viability of MOFs as an alternative to currently used electrocatalysts are also discussed. Finally, the future direction of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysis research is established.

         <title>A 2D Ultrathin Nanopatterned Interlayer to Suppress Lithium Dendrite Growth in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (&lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective (composed of lithiophilic seeds, 2D blocking layer, and vertically porous membrane) is strategically designed for tackling the chronic issue of dendritic growth of lithium (Li). The synergetic interactions between the layers enhance mechanical robustness and facilitate fast and homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, which result in smooth and stabilized Li growth and outstanding cycling stability.








Abstract
A novel strategy for robust and ultrathin (&lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective structures to address uncontrolled Lithium (Li) dendrite growth at Li&#8208;metal battery anodes is reported. Synergetic interaction among Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films, and self&#8208;assembled block&#8208;copolymer (BCP) layers enables effective suppression of dendritic Li growth. While Ag NP layer confines the growth of Li metal underneath the rGO layer, BCP layer facilitates the fast and uniformly distributed flux of Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanically supports the rGO layer. Notably, highly aligned nanochannels with &#8776;15&#160;nm diameter and &#8776;600&#160;nm length scale interpenetrating within the BCP layer offer reversible well&#8208;defined pathways for Li&#8208;ion transport. Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary&#8208;growth of Li metal. Li&#8208;metal anodes modified with the protective layer well&#8208;maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full&#8208;cells paired with high&#8208;loading of LiFePO4 cathodes. The idealized design of multilayer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li&#8208;metal anodes.

     alt="A 2D Ultrathin Nanopatterned Interlayer to Suppress Lithium Dendrite Growth in High-Energy Lithium-Metal Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin (&amp;lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective (composed of lithiophilic seeds, 2D blocking layer, and vertically porous membrane) is strategically designed for tackling the chronic issue of dendritic growth of lithium (Li). The synergetic interactions between the layers enhance mechanical robustness and facilitate fast and homogenized Li-ion flux, which result in smooth and stabilized Li growth and outstanding cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy for robust and ultrathin (&amp;lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective structures to address uncontrolled Lithium (Li) dendrite growth at Li-metal battery anodes is reported. Synergetic interaction among Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films, and self-assembled block-copolymer (BCP) layers enables effective suppression of dendritic Li growth. While Ag NP layer confines the growth of Li metal underneath the rGO layer, BCP layer facilitates the fast and uniformly distributed flux of Li-ion transport and mechanically supports the rGO layer. Notably, highly aligned nanochannels with &#8776;15&#160;nm diameter and &#8776;600&#160;nm length scale interpenetrating within the BCP layer offer reversible well-defined pathways for Li-ion transport. Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary-growth of Li metal. Li-metal anodes modified with the protective layer well-maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited solid-electrolyte interphase formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full-cells paired with high-loading of LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes. The idealized design of multilayer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li-metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supercritical Relaxor Nanograined Ferroelectrics for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are proposed, to achieve record&#8208;high overall energy&#8208;storage properties in lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramic capacitors. Ex/in situ multiscale structure evolution coupled with the energy&#8208;storage process provides clear evidence of the supercritical behavior, as achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone.








Abstract
Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are demonstrated for high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors, showing record&#8208;high overall properties of energy density &#8776;13.1 J cm&#8722;3 and field&#8208;insensitive efficiency &#8776;90% at &#8776;74&#160;kV mm&#8722;1 and superior charge&#8211;discharge performances of high power density &#8776;700 MW cm&#8722;3, high discharge energy density &#8776;6.67 J cm&#8722;3, and ultrashort discharge time &lt;40&#160;ns at 55&#160;kV mm&#8722;1. Ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction provide clear evidence of the supercritical behavior in (Na,K)(Sb,Nb)O3&#8211;SrZrO3&#8211;(Bi0.5Na0.5)ZrO3 ceramics, being achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone. The vanished difference between the ground relaxor state and the high&#8208;field supercritical state eliminates polarization hysteresis. The supercritical evolution with electric field enables a highly delayed polarization saturation with continuously increased polarization magnitudes. The results demonstrate that such a design strategy of compositionally induced and field&#8208;manipulated supercritical behavior can be generalizable for developing desirable energy&#8208;storage dielectrics for applications in ceramic/film capacitors.

         <title>Flexible Metamaterial Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest progress of novel flexible electronics with enhancing and innovating properties and functionalities stemming from the conceptual breakthrough of various metamaterials are reviewed; this burgeoning interdisciplinary field is coined as &#8220;flexible metamaterial electronics.&#8221; The artificial creation of metamaterials is able to break the current fetters and open a new direction for the further development of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Over the last decade, extensive efforts have been made on utilizing advanced materials and structures to improve the properties and functionalities of flexible electronics. While the conventional ways are approaching their natural limits, a revolutionary strategy, namely metamaterials, is emerging toward engineering structural materials to break the existing fetters. Metamaterials exhibit supernatural physical behaviors, in aspects of mechanical, optical, thermal, acoustic, and electronic properties that are inaccessible in natural materials, such as tunable stiffness or Poisson's ratio, manipulating electromagnetic or elastic waves, and topological and programmable morphability. These salient merits motivate metamaterials as a brand&#8208;new research direction and have inspired extensive innovative applications in flexible electronics. Here, such a groundbreaking interdisciplinary field is first coined as &#8220;flexible metamaterial electronics,&#8221; focusing on enhancing and innovating functionalities of flexible electronics via the design of metamaterials. Herein, the latest progress and trends in this infant field are reviewed while highlighting their potential value. First, a brief overview starts with introducing the combination of metamaterials and flexible electronics. Then, the developed applications are discussed, such as self&#8208;adaptive deformability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and multidisciplinary functionality, followed by the discussion of potential prospects. Finally, the challenges and opportunities facing flexible metamaterial electronics to advance this cutting&#8208;edge field are summarized.

         <title>Brain Co&#8208;Delivery of Temozolomide and Cisplatin for Combinatorial Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) cell membrane camouflaged biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with pH&#8208;sensitive polymer as core are developed for effective temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) brain&#8208;targeting co&#8208;delivery, achieving effective antitumor efficacy in both U87MG&#8208; and TMZ&#8208;resistant U251R orthotopic mice models with negligible side effects.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable malignancy with high recurrence and mortality. Combinatorial therapy based on temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) shows promising potential for GBM therapy in clinical trials. However, significant challenges include limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration, poor targeting of GBM tissue/cells, and systemic side effects, which hinder its efficacy in GBM therapy. To surmount these challenges,&#160;new GBM&#8208;cell membrane camouflaged and pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) inspired by the fact that cancer cells readily pass the BBB and localize with homologous cells, are developed. This study's results show that MNPs can efficiently co&#8208;load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH&#8208;sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combination drug therapy. Mice bearing orthotopic U87MG or drug&#8208;resistant U251R GBM tumor and treated with MNPs@TMZ+CDDP show a potent anti&#8208;GBM effect, greatly extending the survival time relative to mice receiving single&#8208;drug loaded nanoparticles. No obvious side effects are apparent in histological analyses or blood routine studies. Considering these results, the study's new nanoparticle formulation overcomes multiple challenges currently limiting the efficacy of combined TMZ and CDDP GBM drug therapy and appears to be a promising strategy for future GBM combinatorial chemotherapy.

         <title>Identifying the Correlation between Structural Parameters and Anisotropic Magnetic Properties in I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V Semiconductors: A Possible Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the single&#8208;crystal growth of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compound series, physical property measurements of their intrinsic anisotropic character, and their theoretical electronic and magnetic structures suggests a possible room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor. These experimental and computational results broaden the scope of intrinsic magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems for spintronics.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured materials are of central importance in a wide range of research fields owing to their unique properties originating from their two dimensionality and anisotropy. Herein, quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compounds are investigated, which are potential antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors. Single crystals of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V compounds are successfully grown using the self&#8208;flux method and their electronic and magnetic properties are analyzed in correlation with structural parameters. Combined with theoretical calculations, the structural analysis indicates that the variation in the bonding angle between V&#63743;Mn&#63743;V is responsible for the change in the orbital hybridization of Mn and V, predominantly affecting their anisotropic semiconducting properties. Anisotropy in the magnetic properties is also found, where AFM ordering is expected to occur in the in&#8208;plane direction, as supported by spin&#8211;structure calculations. Furthermore, a possible ferromagnetic (FM) transition is discussed in relation to the vacancy defects. This study provides a candidate material group for AFM and FM spintronics and a basis for exploring magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems.

         <title>Digital Light Processing 3D Printing of Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels with Sophisticated Architectures as Impact&#8208;Absorption Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital Light Processing 3D printing of hydrogels with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; projection approach is realized by a fast gelation and toughening process with in situ formation of coordination complexes as the physical crosslinks. The high stiffness and antiswelling properties of as&#8208;printed tough supramolecular hydrogel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form sophisticated architectures, favoring the design of hydrogel devices with versatile applications.








Abstract
Processing tough hydrogels into sophisticated architectures is crucial for their applications as structural elements. However, Digital Light Processing (DLP) printing of tough hydrogels is challenging because of the low&#8208;speed gelation and toughening process. Described here is a simple yet versatile system suitable for DLP printing to form tough hydrogel architectures. The aqueous precursor consists of commercial photoinitiator, acrylic acid, and zirconium ion (Zr4+), readily forming tough metallo&#8208;supramolecular hydrogel under digital light because of in situ formation of carboxyl&#8211;Zr4+ coordination complexes. The high&#8208;stiffness and antiswelling properties of as&#8208;printed gel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form high&#8208;fidelity constructs. Furthermore, swelling&#8208;induced morphing of the gel is also achieved by encoding structure gradients during the printing with grayscale digital light. Mechanical properties of the printed hydrogels are further improved after incubation in water due to the variation of local pH and rearrangement of coordination complex. The swelling&#8208;enhanced stiffness affords the printed hydrogel with shape fixation ability after manual deformations, and thereby provides an additional avenue to form more complex configurations. These printed hydrogels are used to devise an impact&#8208;absorption element or a high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensor as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. This work should merit engineering of other tough gels and extend their scope of applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Fast Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection Using III&#8211;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphoteric liganding strategy is developed to simultaneously address In and As dangling bonds on InAs colloidal quantum dot (CQD) surfaces, which provides passivation and charge transport for low&#8208;permittivity CQD solids. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2 ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously&#160;reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency of 30% at 940 nm.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for infrared (IR) light detection due to their tunable bandgap and their solution processing; however, to date, the time response of CQD IR photodiodes is inferior to that provided by Si and InGaAs. It is reasoned that the high permittivity of II&#8211;VI CQDs leads to slow charge extraction due to screening and capacitance, whereas III&#8211;Vs&#8212;if their surface chemistry can be mastered&#8212;offer a low permittivity and thus increase potential for high&#8208;speed operation. In initial studies, it is found that the covalent character in indium arsenide (InAs) leads to imbalanced charge transport, the result of unpassivated surfaces, and uncontrolled heavy doping. Surface management using amphoteric ligand coordination is reported, and it is found that the approach addresses simultaneously the In and As surface dangling bonds. The new InAs CQD solids combine high mobility (0.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) with a 4&#215; reduction in permittivity compared to PbS CQDs. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2&#160;ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30% at 940&#160;nm.

         <title>W Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for CH4 Photooxidation in Water Vapor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere. These single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH to achieve highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor, and the products can be facilely switched from HCOOH to CH3OH by the liquid&#8211;solid phase transition.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven high&#8208;efficiency and direct conversion of methane into high&#8208;value&#8208;added liquid oxygenates against overoxidation remains a great challenge. Herein, facile and mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single&#8208;atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere (W&#8208;SA&#8208;PCN&#8208;m, urea amount m&#160;= 7.5, 15, 30, and 150&#160;g). The single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH, thus achieving highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor under mild conditions. Systematic investigations demonstrate that integration of multifunctions of methane activation, H2O2 generation, and decomposition into one photocatalyst can dramatically promote methane conversion to C1 oxygenates with a yield as high as 4956 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1, superior to that of the most reported non&#8208;precious photocatalysts. Liquid&#8211;solid phase transition can induce the products to facilely switch in&#160;from HCOOH to CH3OH by pulling the catalyst above water with CH3OH/HCOOH ratio from 10% (in H2O) to 80% (above H2O).

         <title>Tailoring the Solvation Sheath of Cations by Constructing Electrode Front&#8208;Faces for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials to construct electrode front&#8208;faces can transfer the high&#8208;energy&#8208;state desolvated solvents from reactive electrode to nonconductive porous material surfaces, thus eliminate the contact chances between desolvated solvents and electrode materials, and reduce solvents&#8208;related decomposition issues. The most recent advances in using advanced electrode front&#8208;faces in rechargeable batteries are comprehensively summarized. Strategies summarized are beneficial for efficient electrolyte design.








Abstract
Solvent molecules within the solvation sheath of cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, Zn2+) are easily to be dehydrogenated especially when coupled with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, and lead to detrimental electrolytes decompositions which finally accelerate capacity decays of rechargeable batteries. Tremendous efforts are devoted to tackle with this long&#8208;lasting issue. Among them, salt&#8208;concentrated strategies are frequently employed to tailor the solvation sheath of cations and improve the stabilities of electrolytes. However, the cost challenges caused by adding extra dose of expensive salts, additives/cosolvents in preparing highly concentrated electrolytes, hinder their further utilizations to some extent. Introducing porous materials&#8208;based electrode front&#8208;faces on the surface of electrodes even within dilute electrolytes can transfer the high&#8208;energy&#8208;state desolvated solvents from the reactive electrodes to the nonconductive porous material surfaces, thus eliminate the contact chances between desolvated solvents and electrode materials, and greatly reduce solvents&#8208;related decomposition issues. Herein, recent advances in using electrode front&#8208;faces to tailor the solvation sheath of metal ions for rechargeable batteries are discussed. Finally, perspectives to the future challenges and opportunities of constructing electrode front&#8208;faces to tailor the solvation sheath of cations by constructing electrode front&#8208;face for rechargeable batteries are provided.

         <title>Versatile Sequential Casting Processing for Highly Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential casting (SC) processing is practical and universal for device performance improvement in both fullerene&#8208; and nonfullerene&#8208;based systems of organic solar cells (OSCs). A swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model is proposed to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Notably, a champion efficiency of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) is reached from SC processing, representing the highest value among binary OSCs.








Abstract
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). Complementary to the widely&#8208;used blend casting (BC) method for BHJ construction, sequential casting (SC) can also enable similar or even better morphology and device performance for OSCs. Here, BC and SC methods on three representative donor:acceptor (D:A) blends are utilized, that is, PM6:PC71BM, PM6:IT&#8208;4F and PM6:L8&#8208;BO. Higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases by taking advantage of beneficial morphology from SC processing are achieved, and a champion PCE of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) based on the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend is reached, representing the record value among binary OSCs. The observations on phase separation and vertical distribution inspire the proposal of the swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Further, the vertical phase segregation is found to deliver an improvement of device performance via affecting the charge transport and collection processes, as evidenced by the D:A&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent photovoltaic properties. Besides, OSCs based on SC processing show advantages on device photostability and upscale fabrication. This work demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of the SC method for BHJ&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Hierarchical Orientation of Wet&#8208;Spun Hybrid Fibers via Rheological Engineering for Zn&#8208;Ion Fiber Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through the introduction of graphene oxide (GO) flakes. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled to integrate into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a GaAs solar cell to deliver a high overall efficiency (9.80%).








Abstract
Wet&#8208;spinning is a promising strategy to fabricate fiber electrodes for real commercial fiber battery applications, according to its great compatibility with large&#8208;scale fiber production. However, engineering the rheological properties of the electrochemical active materials to accommodate the viscoelasticity or liquid crystalline requirements for continuous wet&#8208;spinning remains a daunting challenge. Here, with entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through introducing 2D graphene oxide (GO) flakes in an optimal ratio. By optimizing the viscoelasticity and liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior of the spinning dope, the wet&#8208;spun hybrid fibers display controlled hierarchical orientation. The wet&#8208;spun V2O5/rGO hybrid fiber with the optimal 10:1 mass fraction (V2O5/rGO10:1) exhibits a highly oriented nanoblock arrangement, enabling efficient Zn&#8208;ion migration and an excellent Zn&#8208;ion storage capacity of 486.03 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. A half&#8208;meter long quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and biocompatible Ecoflex encapsulation. The thus&#8208;derived fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is integrated into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a highly efficient GaAs solar cell, which delivers a record&#8208;high overall efficiency (9.80%) for flexible solar charging systems.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance Extension and Spin&#8208;Vibronic&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Based Narrowband Blue Organic Fluorescence Emitters with Over 30% Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole&#8208;derived extended multiple&#8208;resonance structure, driven by the spin&#8208;vibronic model, is designed to reduce the gap between the singlet and triplet excited states and to increase absolute photoluminescence quantum yield. Pure blue organic&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency over 30% and a narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm are realized with extended multiple&#8208;resonance emitters.








Abstract
Achieving narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously is a challenge for next&#8208;generation blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, novel multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed by fusing an indolocarbazole unit with two carbazole skeletons using para&#8208;oriented nitrogen atoms. The resulting rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;system without electron&#8208;accepting atoms exhibits pure blue photoluminescence at 470&#160;nm, reaching a 100% quantum yield with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Higher&#8208;level quantum chemistry calculations confirm an MR effect within the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and an enhanced triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet crossover (104 s&#8722;1) through a reduced energy gap (&#916;EST) coupled with large spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mediated by low&#8208;lying triplet excited states. An OLED fabricated using the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.16) exhibits a record high EQE of 30.9% and a small FWHM of 23&#160;nm. With further optimization of the device structure, a high EQE of 33.8% is achieved without additional outcoupling enhancements owing to the near&#8208;perfect horizontal alignment of the emitting dipoles.

         <title>Reversible Deformation of Artificial Cell Colonies Triggered by Actin Polymerization for Muscle Behavior Mimicry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered artificial cells are developed by encapsulating mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, which initiate the polymerization of actin monomers to form filaments. The artificial cells are deformed by the formation of actin filaments and recovered by their depolymerization via laser irradiation. The linearly hemifused artificial cell colonies are confirmed to exhibit synchronized collective behaviors to mimic muscle tissues.








Abstract
The use of artificial cells to mimic living tissues is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of interaction among cells. Artificial cells hold immense potential in the field of tissue engineering. Self&#8208;powered artificial cells capable of reversible deformation are developed by encapsulating living mitochondria, actins, and methylcellulose. Upon addition of pyruvate molecules, the mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as an energy source to trigger actin polymerization. The reversible deformation of artificial cells occurs with a spindle shape resulting from the polymerization of actins to form filaments adjacent to the lipid bilayer that subsequently returns to a spherical shape resulting from the depolymerization of actin filaments upon laser irradiation. The linear colonies composed of these artificial cells exhibit collective contraction and relaxation to mimic muscle tissues. At maximum contraction, the long axis of each giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) is parallel to each other. All the colonies are synchronized in the contraction phase. The deformation of each GUV in the colonies is influenced by its adjacent GUVs. The muscle&#8208;like artificial cell colonies described here pave the way to develop sustainably self&#8208;powered artificial tissues.

         <title>Turbostratic Boron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen and Boron Nitride by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turbostratic boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen and boron nitride compounds with various chemical compositions can be prepared by the ultrafast and solvent&#8208;free flash Joule heating method. The obtained flash boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen (f&#8208;BCN) is easily exfoliated via various mechanical methods. Compared to commercial hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates, flash boron nitride sheets demonstrate more stable dispersibility in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the addition of f&#8208;BCN as barrier fillers in poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites shows higher corrosion protection efficiency, &#8776;97.3% in 0.5 m H2SO4 and &#8776;92.1% in 3.5 wt% NaCl (aq).








Abstract
Turbostratic layers in 2D materials have an interlayer misalignment. The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well&#8208;aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions.

&lt;p&gt;Turbostratic boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen and boron nitride compounds with various chemical compositions can be prepared by the ultrafast and solvent-free flash Joule heating method. The obtained flash boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen (f-BCN) is easily exfoliated via various mechanical methods. Compared to commercial hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates, flash boron nitride sheets demonstrate more stable dispersibility in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the addition of f-BCN as barrier fillers in poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites shows higher corrosion protection efficiency, &#8776;97.3% in 0.5 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8776;92.1% in 3.5 wt% NaCl (aq).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turbostratic layers in 2D materials have an interlayer misalignment. The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well-aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions. However, direct and rapid synthesis of turbostratic materials remains a challenge owing to their thermodynamically metastable properties. Here, a flash Joule heating (FJH) method to achieve bulk synthesis of boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen ternary compounds with turbostratic structures by a kinetically controlled ultrafast cooling process that takes place within milliseconds (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;to&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; K s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported. Theoretical calculations support the existence of turbostratic structures and provide estimates of the energy barriers with respect to conversion into the corresponding well-aligned counterparts. When using non-carbon conductive additives, a direct synthesis of boron nitride is possible. The turbostratic nature facilitates mechanical exfoliation and more stable dispersions. Accordingly, the addition of flash products to a poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite film coating a copper surface greatly improves the copper's resistance to corrosion in 0.5 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; sulfuric acid or 3.5 wt% saline solution.

         <title>Hot&#8208;casting Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8208;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, we show that we can reduce the amount of residual DMSO in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of pre&#8208;heated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot&#8208;casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions which allows us to reduce the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot&#8208;casting, we are able to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8208;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices showed considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high&#8208;power of ultraviolet&#8208;(UV&#8208;)containing continuous light exposure.

         <title>Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination in water, as well as an alternative to Haber&#8208;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts are usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts were designed and the catalytic activity was retained after operation for more than 2000 hours while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved, obtaining a well balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking was achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering down the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital symmetry matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Engineer ActiveLayer Morphology for Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile top&#8208;down strategy to control the all&#8208;polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) morphology is developed by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing. Optimal intermixing of polymer components and improved molecular packing of bottom layer and top layer can be achieved by choosing a suitable top&#8208;layer processing solvent. Consequently, a favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution is realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0%.








Abstract
A major challenge hindering the further development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) employing polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors is the relatively low fill factor (FF) due to the difficulty in controlling the active&#8208;layer morphology. The issues typically arise from oversized phase separation resulting from the thermodynamically unfavorable mixing between two macromolecular species, and disordered molecular orientation/packing of highly anisotropic polymer chains. Herein, a facile top&#8208;down controlling strategy to engineer the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends is developed by leveraging the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition. Optimal intermixing of polymer components can be achieved in the two&#8208;step process by tuning the bottom&#8208;layer polymer swelling during top&#8208;layer deposition. Consequently, both the molecular orientation/packing of the bottom layer and the molecular ordering&#160;of the top layer can be optimized with a suitable top&#8208;layer&#160;processing solvent. A favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution for efficient charge transport and extraction is therefore realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0% with a FF of 76.1%. The derived devices also possess excellent long&#8208;term thermal stability and can retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after being annealed at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1300 h. These results validate the distinct advantages of employing an LBL processing protocol to fabricate high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Promoting Dinuclear&#8208;Type Catalysis in Cu1&#8211;C3N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear&#8208;type nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition in a 21 wt% carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1&#8211;C3N4) is demonstrated by reducing the inter&#8208;atom distance within the diffusion length of reactants, thus transforming the catalytic pathway from a poorly active single&#8208;site to dinuclear&#8208;type mechanism.








Abstract
Reducing particle size in supported metal catalysts to single&#8208;atom level isolates the active metal sites and maximizes the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the large inter&#8208;atom distance, particularly in low&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), is not favorable for a complex reaction where two (or more) reactants have to be activated. A key question is how to control the inter&#8208;atom distances to promote dinuclear&#8208;type coactivation at the adjacent metal sites. Here, it is reported that reducing the average inter&#8208;atom distance of copper SACs supported on carbon nitride (C3N4) to 0.74 &#177; 0.13&#160;nm allows these catalysts to exhibit a dinuclear&#8208;type catalytic mechanism in the nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure study reveals a dynamic ligand exchange process between nitrile and azide, followed by their coactivation on dinuclear Cu SAC sites to form the tetrazole product. This work highlights that reducing the nearest&#8208;neighbor distance of SAC allows the mechanistic pathway to diversify from single&#8208;site to multisite catalysis.

         <title>Switchable Unipolar&#8208;Barrier Van der Waals Heterostructures with Natural Anisotropy for Full Linear Polarimetry Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted unipolar barrier van der Waals heterostructure with bias&#8208;switchable natural polarization photoresponse is successfully designed, which enables full linear polarimetry detection from 0 to 180&#176;. Moreover, polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with this developed photodetector in the mid&#8208;infrared range.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;resolved photodetection in a compact footprint is of great interest for ultraminiaturized polarimeters to be used in a wide range of applications. However, probing the states of polarization (SOP) in materials with natural anisotropy are usually weak, limited by the material's natural dichroism or diattenuation. Here, a twisted unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to construct a bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection for retrieval of full SOP (from 0 to 180&#176;) for linear polarized incident light is reported. As a demonstration example, this study realizes the concept in a b&#8208;AsP/WS2/b&#8208;AsP vdWH relying on the natural anisotropic properties of the materials without using additional plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures to realize linear polarimetry in the mid&#8208;infrared range. Polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with the developed linear polarimetry by directly displaying the Jones&#8208;vector&#8208;described SOP distribution of certain target object. This method, with the capabilities of detecting full linear SOP, is promising for the next&#8208;generation on&#8208;chip miniaturized polarimeters.

         <title>Conjugated Polymers for Microwave Applications: Untethered Sensing Platforms and Multifunctional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active reconfigurability of different microwave resonating structures is achieved through an emerging family of high&#8208;performance organic mixed&#8208;conductors, characterized by superior charge&#8208;transport properties and redox&#8208;tunability. This novel class of microwave devices displays optimal modulation performances, as well as the potential for unique functionalities in the contexts of autonomous bioelectronics and of reconfigurable microwave optics.








Abstract
In the past two decades, organic electronic materials have enabled and accelerated a large and diverse set of technologies, from energy&#8208;harvesting devices and electromechanical actuators, to flexible and printed (opto)electronic circuitry. Among organic (semi)conductors, organic mixed ion&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are now at the center of renewed interest in organic electronics, as they are key drivers of recent developments in the fields of bioelectronics, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, due to the relatively slow switching dynamics of organic electronics, their application in microwave technology, until recently, has been overlooked. Nonetheless, other unique properties of OMIECs, such as their substantial electrochemical tunability, charge&#8208;modulation range, and processability, make this field of use ripe with opportunities. In this work, the use of a series of solution&#8208;processed intrinsic OMIECs is demonstrated to actively tune the properties of metamaterial&#8208;inspired microwave devices, including an untethered bioelectrochemical sensing platform that requires no external power, and a tunable resonating structure with independent amplitude&#8208; and frequency&#8208;modulation. These devices showcase the considerable potential of OMIEC&#8208;based metadevices in autonomous bioelectronics and reconfigurable microwave optics.

         <title>Formulating High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Heterostructured Layered Oxide Cathodes by Local Chemistry and Orbital Hybridization Modulation for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries&#160;(SIBs) is successfully constructed, and its dynamic formation process, intrinsic structural properties, and electrochemical behavior are elucidated by a series of in situ characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations. The concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating heterostructured cathode materials by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is further demonstrated.








Abstract
It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high&#8208;performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2&#8208;structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic&#8208;scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2&#160;C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high&#8208;performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.

         <title>Walking Dead Tumor Cells for Targeted Drug Delivery Against Lung Metastasis of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is developed by anchoring anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies and doxorubicin&#8208;loaded liposomes on tumor cell corpses to treat lung metastatic TNBC. The cell platform, named &#8220;walking dead tumor cells&#8221;, promotes lung&#8208;metastasis&#8208;targeted drug delivery and enables temporal release of drugs via bioinspired&#8208;activation and nano&#8208;backpack. Improved therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis is achieved by the platform in mouse models.








Abstract
Lung metastasis is challenging in patients with triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate an inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote invasion and colonization. Herein, &#8220;walking dead&#8221; TNBC cells are developed through conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction&#8208;activated linker, and DOX&#8208;loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide&#8211;thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 upon reduction conditions while long&#8208;lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram the lung microenvironment through damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD&#8208;1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6&#8208;bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.

         <title>Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the work function of gate electrodes in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) via chemical doping makes threshold voltage an independently tunable parameter from channel properties, thereby retaining the electrochemical, transport, and amplifying properties of the OECT. This enables simultaneously low&#8208;power and electrochemically stable enhancement mode OECTs.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low&#8208;powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution&#8208;processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air&#8208;sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low&#8208;powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.

     alt="Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying the work function of gate electrodes in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) via chemical doping makes threshold voltage an independently tunable parameter from channel properties, thereby retaining the electrochemical, transport, and amplifying properties of the OECT. This enables simultaneously low-power and electrochemically stable enhancement mode OECTs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low-powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution-processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air-sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low-powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia at Ultra&#8208;low Concentrations via Enrichment Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to NH3 offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultra&#8208;low NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultra&#8208;low concentrations was developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8208;0.3&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE), Cu@C achieved Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;mM NO3&#8722;, which was 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8208;0.9&#160;V versus RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C was 469.5&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which was the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;mM NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism revealed that NO3&#8722; could be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared for the first time to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, salinity of 20 wt%, and a continuous 8 h evaporation is achieved, which to our knowledge is the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) were directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF mono&#8208;cores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a mono&#8208;core structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with CIEs of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) around 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, we report a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enabled us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or digital light printer (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>Future Research Directions in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exquisite Photon Management and Thermodynamic Phase Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased up to 25.7% in 2022, a curiosity about the achievable limit of PCE has prevailed and demands understanding about the underlying fundamentals to step forward. Meanwhile, outstanding long&#8208;term stability of PSCs over 1000&#160;h has been reported at operating condition or under damp heat test with 85 &#176;C/85% RH. Here comes a question whether the phase stability issue of perovskite crystal is completely resolved in the most recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite film or deceives us into believing by significantly slowing the kinetics. On one hand, we thoroughly examine the fundamental origins of a discrepancy between a reported value and its theoretical limit, where the importance of light management is greatly emphasized with introducing external luminescence as a key parameter to narrow the gap.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased up to 25.7% in 2022, a curiosity about the achievable limit of PCE has prevailed and demands understanding about the underlying fundamentals to step forward. Meanwhile, outstanding long-term stability of PSCs over 1000&#160;h has been reported at operating condition or under damp heat test with 85 &#176;C/85% RH. Here comes a question whether the phase stability issue of perovskite crystal is completely resolved in the most recent state-of-the-art perovskite film or deceives us into believing by significantly slowing the kinetics. On one hand, we thoroughly examine the fundamental origins of a discrepancy between a reported value and its theoretical limit, where the importance of light management is greatly emphasized with introducing external luminescence as a key parameter to narrow the gap. On the other hand, the phase stability of perovskite film is understood from thermodynamic point of view to address viable approaches to lower Gibbs free energy with distinguishing the kinetically trapped condition from the thermodynamically stable phase.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, we designed a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl and explored its photovoltaic performance. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices delivered an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrated that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells were fabricated and displayed an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. Our results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atom as High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on account of their outstanding catalytic potential have currently emerged as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays the pivotal role. Herein, we reported a Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs by using a &#226;&#8364;&#732;self&#8208;reduction&#226;&#8364;&#8482; strategy via assistance of rich Ti vacancies on Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene surface, which acted as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (Ni SACs/Ti 3 C 2 T x ) showed an ultralow onset potential of &#8208;0.03 V ( vs. Reversible Hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability towards hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggested a strong coupling of Ni single atom and its surrounding C atoms, which optimized the electronic density of states that increased adsorption energy and decreased reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. Results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapped strategy.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in the bulk material but can also lead to degraded properties in the ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control the charge transfer would be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remotely manipulating the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrently restoring the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cells LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine tune the electronic features of complex multi&#8208;layered heterostructures.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs), as an emerging class of electrode materials, have attracted great attention recently. The efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of c&#8208;MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are reviewed. The recent achievements of developing supercapacitors with c&#8208;MOF electrodes are discussed, from the experimental performance to a fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanism, highlighting their bottlenecks and perspectives.








Abstract
As a class of porous materials with crystal lattices, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring outstanding specific surface area, tunable functionality, and versatile structures, have attracted huge attention in the past two decades. Since the first conductive MOF&#160;is&#160;successfully synthesized in 2009, considerable progress has been achieved for the development of conductive MOFs, allowing their use in diverse applications for electrochemical energy storage. Among those applications, supercapacitors have received great interest because of their high power density, fast charging ability, and excellent cycling stability. Here, the efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of conductive MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are summarized. Using conductive MOFs as a unique platform medium, the electronic and molecular aspects of the energy storage mechanism in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes are discussed, highlighting the advantages and limitations to inspire new ideas for the development of conductive MOFs for supercapacitors.

         <title>Spontaneous Construction of Nucleophilic Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Interphase toward Ultrastable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic carbonyl&#8208;containing interphase with strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability is rationally designed as a spontaneous construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a Zn anode, facilitating homogeneous Zn deposition and leading to the long&#8208;term stability of aqueous ZIBs. The cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network formed by the electronegative carbonyl oxygen can bind water molecules while regulating the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process and mitigating side reactions.








Abstract
Multifunctional interfacial engineering on the Zn anode to conquer dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution, and the sluggish kinetics associated with Zn deposition is highly desirable for boosting the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl&#8208;containing layer on a Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the highly electronegative and highly nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process at the interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000&#160;h (&gt;208&#160;days) with a dendrite&#8208;free surface and negligible by&#8208;products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10&#8208;based full&#8208;cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by the strategy of spontaneous construction of functional solid electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;storage systems.

The stabilized Zn anode enabled by the strategy of spontaneous construction of functional solid electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach toward high-performance zinc-storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Ultrafast Defect&#8208;Controlled Interlayer Electron&#8211;Phonon Coupling in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects open a new ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling in WS2/graphene heterostructures, which involves a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This ultrafast process is directly visualized by femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. Through controlling the defect density in graphene, the interlayer electron&#8211;phonon scattering time ranges from 7.1 to 2.4 ps.








Abstract
Engineering ultrafast interlayer coupling provides access to new quantum phenomena and novel device functionalities in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures. However, due to all the atoms of a monolayer material being exposed at the interfaces, the interlayer coupling is extremely susceptible to defects, resulting in high energy dissipation through heat and low device performance. The study of how defects affect the interlayer coupling at ultrafast and atomic scales remains a challenge. Here, using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy, a new defect&#8208;induced ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling pathway is identified in a WS2/graphene heterostructure, involving a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This interaction manifests as the reduced defect&#8208;related Raman resonant activity and the accelerated electron&#8211;phonon scattering time from 7.1 to 2.4&#160;ps. Furthermore, the ultrafast interlayer coupling process is directly imaged. These insights will advance the fundamental knowledge of heat dissipation in nanoscale devices, and enable new ways to dynamically manipulate electrons and phonons via defects in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Changing Fate: Reprogramming Cells via Engineered Nanoscale Delivery Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials enabling cell reprogramming provide a new paradigm for the restoration of healthy tissue and organs. Future clinical interventions will no longer require invasive surgery, or pharmaceutical regimens; it can be achieved through the controlled reprograming of regenerative cells. The authors review the multiscale delivery vehicles that can support and precisely deliver the raw genetic material and transformative vectors required.








Abstract
The incorporation of nanotechnology in regenerative medicine is at the nexus of fundamental innovations and early&#8208;stage breakthroughs, enabling exciting biomedical advances. One of the most exciting recent developments is the use of nanoscale constructs to influence the fate of cells, which are the basic building blocks of healthy function. Appropriate cell types can be effectively manipulated by direct cell reprogramming; a robust technique to manipulate cellular function and fate, underpinning burgeoning advances in drug delivery systems, regenerative medicine, and disease remodeling. Individual transcription factors, or combinations thereof, can be introduced into cells using both viral and nonviral delivery systems. Existing approaches have inherent limitations. Viral&#8208;based tools include issues of viral integration into the genome of the cells, the propensity for uncontrollable silencing, reduced copy potential and cell specificity, and neutralization via the immune response. Current nonviral cell reprogramming tools generally suffer from inferior expression efficiency. Nanomaterials are increasingly being explored to address these challenges and improve the efficacy of both viral and nonviral delivery because of their unique properties such as small size and high surface area. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research in cell reprogramming, focused on recent breakthroughs in the deployment of nanomaterials as cell reprogramming delivery tools.

         <title>Bioinspired Stretchable Transducer for Wearable Continuous Monitoring of Respiratory Patterns in Humans and Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bio&#8208;inspired composite silicone transducer, consisting of an air channel encapsulated within a silicone elastomer, measures mechanical forces applied to its surface during respiration. The transducer technology reported is suitable for use with furry animals (pets and laboratory animals) and humans for unobtrusive monitoring of respiration over fur or clothing.








Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired continuous wearable respiration sensor modeled after the lateral line system of fish is reported which is used for detecting mechanical disturbances in the water. Despite the clinical importance of monitoring respiratory activity in humans and animals, continuous measurements of breathing patterns and rates are rarely performed in or outside of clinics. This is largely because conventional sensors are too inconvenient or expensive for wearable sensing for most individuals and animals. The bio&#8208;inspired air&#8208;silicone composite transducer (ASiT) is placed on the chest and measures respiratory activity by continuously measuring the force applied to an air channel embedded inside a silicone&#8208;based elastomeric material. The force applied on the surface of the transducer during breathing changes the air pressure inside the channel, which is measured using a commercial pressure sensor and mixed&#8208;signal wireless electronics. The transducer produced in this work are extensively characterized and tested with humans, dogs, and laboratory rats. The bio&#8208;inspired ASiT may enable the early detection of a range of disorders that result in altered patterns of respiration. The technology reported can also be combined with artificial intelligence and cloud computing to algorithmically detect illness in humans and animals remotely, reducing unnecessary visits to clinics.

         <title>Stoichiometric Post&#8208;Modification of Hydrogel Microparticles Dictates Neural Stem Cell Fate in Microporous Annealed Particle Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is used to create plain microgels for stoichiometric post&#8208;modification with various peptides to control neural progenitor cell growth and differentiation in vitro. YIGSR peptide presentation leads to neurosphere formation while IKVAV leads to stem cell spreading and differentiation.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are generated from assembled hydrogel microparticles (microgels). It has been previously demonstrated that MAP scaffold&#160;are porous, biocompatible, and recruit neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the stroke cavity after injection into the stroke core. Here, the goal is to study NPC fate inside MAP&#160;scaffolds in vitro. To create plain microgels that can later be converted to contain different types of bioactivities, the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is utilized, which allows the post&#8208;modification of plain microgels stoichiometrically. As a result of adhesive peptide attachment, NPC spreading leads to contractile force generation which can be recorded by tracking microgel displacement. Alternatively, non&#8208;adhesive peptide integration results in neurosphere formation that grows within the void space&#160;of MAP scaffolds. Although the formed neurospheres do not impose a contractile force on the scaffolds, they are seen to continuously transverse the scaffolds. It is concluded that MAP scaffolds&#160;&#160;can be engineered to either promote neurogenesis or enhance stemness depending on the chosen post&#8208;modifications of the microgels, which can be key in modulating their phenotypes in various applications in vivo.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells Breaking 19% via Manipulating the Vertical Component Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance binary photovoltaic devices based on D18 and L8&#8208;BO are constructed via manipulating the vertical component distribution in a sequential deposition (SD) process. After tuning the spin&#8208;coating speeds of film deposition, the optimal SD device affords a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% (certified, 18.9%) for binary single&#8208;junction organic solar cells, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting device (18.14%).








Abstract
The variation of the vertical component distribution can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transport and recombination. Herein, binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8&#8208;BO materials in a two&#8208;step process. Upon independently regulating the spin&#8208;coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single&#8208;junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting the photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton splitting, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all&#8208;around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performance and vertical component distribution.

After tuning the spin-coating speeds of film deposition, the optimal SD device affords a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% (certified, 18.9%) for binary single-junction organic solar cells, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting device (18.14%).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variation of the vertical component distribution can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transport and recombination. Herein, binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8-BO materials in a two-step process. Upon independently regulating the spin-coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single-junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting the photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton splitting, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all-around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high-efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performance and vertical component distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Capacitors with Confined Redox Electrolytes and Porous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox electrolyte&#8208;enhanced electrochemical capacitors constructed with confined redox electrolytes and porous electrodes feature the properties of high capacitance, high stability, and high energy and power densities. They are expected to occupy a dominant position among different electrochemical energy storage systems and are promising to be employed as power suppliers for various applications.








Abstract
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), including electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, feature high power densities but low energy densities. To improve the energy densities of ECs, redox electrolyte&#8208;enhanced ECs (R&#8208;ECs) or supercapbatteries are designed through employing confined soluble redox electrolytes and porous electrodes. In R&#8208;ECs the energy storage is based on diffusion&#8208;controlled faradaic processes of confined redox electrolytes at the surface of a porous electrode, which thus take the merits of high power densities of ECs and high energy densities of batteries. In the past few years, there has been great progress in the development of this energy storage technology, particularly in the design and synthesis of novel redox electrolytes and porous electrodes, as well as the configurations of new devices. Herein, a full&#8208;screen picture of the fundamentals and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art progress of R&#8208;ECs are given together with a discussion and outlines about the challenges and future perspectives of R&#8208;ECs. The strategies to improve the performance of R&#8208;ECs are highlighted from the aspects of their capacitances and capacitance retention, power densities, and energy densities. The insight into the philosophies behind these strategies will be favorable to promote the R&#8208;EC technology toward practical applications of supercapacitors in different fields.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Glass for Low&#8208;Cost White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of amorphous molecular materials for white&#8208;light generation (WLG) by means of continuous&#8208;wave infrared lasers is introduced, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;. For their fabrication, compounds of the general formula [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) are synthesized in pure and crystalline form and reversibly transformed into amorphous, robust glasses of any shape by mild heating. The materials and WLG properties of the cluster&#8208;glasses are studied by a combined experimental and quantum chemical study.








Abstract
The development of efficient and high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong nonlinear optical properties, in particular second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) or white&#8208;light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white&#8208;light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous&#8208;wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids, is introduced. The cluster&#8208;glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane&#8208;type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and recrystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.

         <title>Enabling Electron Injection for Microbial Electrosynthesis with n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Microbial electrosynthesis &#8211; using renewable electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism &#8211; holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. A key limitation hindering performance are slow electron transfer rates at biotic&#8208;abiotic interfaces. Here, we rationally design and synthesize a new n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte and demonstrate its use as a soft conductive material to encapsulate electroactive bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1. The self&#8208;assembled three&#8208;dimensional living biocomposite amplifies current uptake from the electrode &#8776;674&#8208;fold over controls with the same initial number of cells, thereby enabling continuous synthesis of succinate from fumarate. Such functionality is a result of the increased number of bacterial cells having intimate electronic communication with the electrode and a higher current uptake per cell. This is underpinned by the molecular design of the polymer to have a n&#8208;dopable conjugated backbone for facile reduction by the electrode and zwitterionic side chains for compatibility with aqueous media. Moreover, we employ direct arylation polycondensation instead of the traditional Stille polymerization to avoid non&#8208;biocompatible tin by&#8208;products. By demonstrating synergy between living cells with n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials, these results provide new strategies for improving the performance of bioelectrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Untangling the Mechanisms of Lattice Distortions in Biogenic Crystals across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy (DFXM) method is used to provide unprecedented information on large biogenic crystals across scales. Detailed analysis in 3D establishes correlations between local nanoscale lattice distortions, chemical composition, and the formation process of the biogenic crystal as a whole. Most importantly, it allows a number of mechanisms that drive the process of biomineral formation to be untangled.








Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth, and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional, and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex 3D architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this has only been possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study, the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy method is employed to study the link between 3D crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. Mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition, and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit are unraveled.

         <title>2D&#8208;Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization strategy effectively generates a new species of highly thermally conductive carbon fibers. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude more conductive than commercial PAN&#8208;based carbon fibers. These fibers have great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials, high&#8208;power electronics, and energy storage.








Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch&#8208;based CFs with high crystallinity.

Here, a 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN&#8208;based CFs. The self&#8208;oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non&#8208;graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretch&#8208;induced kinematic reorganization of Ag flakes in a viscoelastic polymer matrix can lead to spontaneous formation of new and efficient conductive pathways with enhanced conductivity, successfully addressing the conductivity&#8211;stretchability dilemma. This study establishes a fundamentally new approach to fabricate filler&#8208;reinforced stretchable conductors, paving the way for the future development of polymer composites for soft, stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic&#8208;filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, it is reported that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by &#8776;4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8776;104 S cm&#8722;1. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Metalloid&#8208;Cluster Ligands Enabling Stable and Active FeN4&#8208;Ten Motifs for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Block metalloid clusters (e.g., Ten) are found to be able to effectively mimic the role of molecular ligands in enzymes. When incorporated into a pyrolyzed FeN4&#8208;carbon framework, the obtained FeN4&#8208;Ten catalyst not only mimics the coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of CYP enzymes, but also keeps the stable nature as a heterogeneous catalyst.








Abstract
In nature, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes containing heme iron centers with an axial thiolate ligand (FeN4&#8208;S), which are among the most finely developed catalysts by natural selection. However, the exceptional ORR activity and selectivity of CYP enzymes originate from their non&#8208;rigid and self&#8208;adaptive coordination network with molecular ligands, which sacrifices the stability of the active motifs under electrochemical reaction conditions. Here, a design strategy to circumvent this dilemma by incorporating Fe&#8208;N4 motifs into carbon matrices instead of the protein scaffold and replacing the axial molecular thiolate ligand with a stable tellurium cluster (Ten) is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations indicate a moderate interaction between Fe 3d and Te 5p orbitals once n&#160;&gt; 2, allowing the Fe&#63743;Te bond to dynamically change its strength to adaptively facilitate the intermediate steps during the ORR process, which renders FeN4&#8208;Ten active sites with superior ORR activity. This adaptive behavior mimics the conformational dynamics of an enzyme during the reaction, but retains the stability nature as a heterogeneous catalyst. The experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed catalyst with a characterized FeN4&#8208;Ten structure outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst both on activity and stability.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;Volume Entropy in Nonequilibrium Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy near the three&#8208;phase contact line and optimized self&#8208;assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod&#8208;superstructure microassembly arrays with long&#8208;range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal&#8208;oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse.








Abstract
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures of nanoparticles with controllable orientation have advantages in applications toward sensors, photoelectric conversion, and field&#8208;effect transistors. The assembly process of nanorods in colloidal systems undergoes a nonequilibrium process from dispersion to aggregation. A variety of assembly methods such as solvent volatilization, electromagnetic field induction, and photoinduction are restricted to suppress local perturbations during the nonequilibrium concentration of nanoparticles, which are adverse to controlling the orientation and order of assembled structures. Here, a confined assembly method is reported by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy in nonequilibrium fluids to fabricate microstructure arrays based on colloidal nanorods with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order. The unique fluid dynamics of the liquid bridge is utilized to form a local region, where the free volume entropy reduction triggers assembly near the three&#8208;phase contact line (TPCL), allowing nanorods to assemble in 2D closest packing parallel to the TPCL for the maximum Gibbs free energy reduction. By manipulating the orientation of liquid flow, microstructures are assembled with programmable geometry, which sustains polarized photoluminescence and polarization&#8208;dependent photodetection. This confined assembly method opens up perspectives on assemblies of nanomaterials with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order as a platform for multifunctional integrated devices.

         <title>Catalytic Growth of Ultralong Graphene Nanoribbons on Insulating Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;long graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of &#8776;2 nm are directly grown on insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrates through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition. These ultranarrow GNRs feature a typical bandgap of &#8776;1 eV, which is suitable for fabricating field&#8208;effect devices. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of a few nanometers are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications due to their structurally tunable bandgaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and exceptional stability. However, the direct growth of micrometer&#8208;long GNRs on insulating substrates, which is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices, remains an immense challenge. Here, the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrate through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is reported. Ultranarrow GNRs with lengths of up to 10&#160;&#181;m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals an average width of 2&#160;nm and a typical bandgap of &#8776;1&#160;eV for similar GNRs grown on conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation of GNRs and carbon nanotubes during the nucleation stage, and van der Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h&#8208;BN substrate throughout the growth stage. This&#160;study provides a scalable, single&#8208;step method for growing micrometer&#8208;long narrow GNRs on insulating substrates, thus opening a route to explore the performance of high&#8208;quality GNR devices and the fundamental physics of 1D moir&#233; superlattices.

Remarkably, the as-grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h-BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of a few nanometers are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications due to their structurally tunable bandgaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and exceptional stability. However, the direct growth of micrometer-long GNRs on insulating substrates, which is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices, remains an immense challenge. Here, the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate through nanoparticle-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is reported. Ultranarrow GNRs with lengths of up to 10&#160;&#181;m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as-grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h-BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals an average width of 2&#160;nm and a typical bandgap of &#8776;1&#160;eV for similar GNRs grown on conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation of GNRs and carbon nanotubes during the nucleation stage, and van der Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h-BN substrate throughout the growth stage. This&#160;study provides a scalable, single-step method for growing micrometer-long narrow GNRs on insulating substrates, thus opening a route to explore the performance of high-quality GNR devices and the fundamental physics of 1D moir&#233; superlattices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembly of AIEgen&#8208;Based Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets and Seaweed Cellulose Nanofibrils for Humidity Sensing and UV&#8208;Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)&#8208;based composites, with strong fluorescence emission sensitive to relative humidity, are fabricated by integrating 4.0 wt% aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in a water suspension. The composite films also show efficient UV&#8208;shielding capacity without compromise of the optical transmittance and excellent mechanical properties, owing to the metal&#8211;carboxylate coordination between the 2D MOF nanosheets and the CNFs.








Abstract
Integrating synthetic low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with a sustainable biopolymer is a promising strategy to endow composites with attractive structural and functional properties for expanded applications. Herein, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based MOF bulk crystals are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are assembled with low amounts (0.3 to 4.0&#160;wt%) of the 2D nanosheets to generate luminescent composites. The 2D nanosheets are adsorbed onto the CNFs in dilute water suspensions owing to the flexibility of the MOF nanosheets and the high aspect ratio of the CNFs. Transparent films are prepared by solution casting from a water suspension of the CNF&#8208;MOF assembly. The fluorescence emission of the composite films is enhanced because of the favored affinity between MOF nanosheets and CNFs. Remarkably, these films demonstrate excellent UV&#8208;shielding capacity and high optical transmittance at the visible wavelength range. The composite films also show reversible changes in fluorescence emission intensity in response to ambient humidity. The tensile strength and modulus of the composite films are also enhanced owing to the increased adhesion between CNFs through the adsorbed MOF nanosheets. This work provides a novel pathway to fabricate luminescent CNFs&#8208;based composites with tunable optical properties for functional materials.

         <title>Local Spin&#8208;State Tuning of Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst by S&#8208;Coordinated Doping for Kinetics&#8208;Boosted Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed monovalent iron(I) site with a medium&#8208;spin state is developed to promote cleavage of the N&#8801;N bonds and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of N2 hydrogenation kinetics.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) is envisaged as alternative technique to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for NH3 synthesis. However, how to develop highly active e&#8208;NRR catalysts faces daunting challenges. Herein, a viable strategy to manipulate local spin state of isolated iron sites through S&#8208;coordinated doping (FeSA&#8208;NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S in the coordination of FeSA&#8208;NSC can induce the transition of spin&#8208;polarization configuration with the formation of a medium&#8208;spin&#8208;state of Fe (t2g6 eg1), which is beneficial for facilitating eg electrons to penetrate the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of nitrogen. As a consequence, a record&#8208;high current density up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, together with a high NH3 selectivity of &#8776;10% in a flow cell reactor. Both experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the monovalent Fe(I) atomic center in the FeSA&#8208;NSC after the S doping accelerates the N2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *N2 to *NNH.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.








Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single&#8208;network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low&#8208;viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.

         <title>Controlled Doping of Electrocatalysts through Engineering Impurities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of ab&#160;initio calculations and atom probe tomography is used to evidence and rationalize B&#8208;doping of Pd nanocatalysts. The doping level is adjusted by controlling the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis conditions, that is, chemical potential and kinetics. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, an influence of B&#8208;doping on the electrocatalytic behavior toward the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby can power, for example, cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet&#8208;chemistry, gaining control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab&#160;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, they thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy.&#8221;

         <title>Ni&#8211;Co Bimetallic Hydroxide Nanosheet Arrays Anchored on Graphene for Adsorption&#8208;Induced Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of transition metal hydroxide NixCoy&#8211;graphene oxide (GR) composites forming porous aerogels with hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure are synthesized by using a simple in situ growth method. Through doping with an appropriate amount of electron&#8208;rich Co, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits the best photocatalytic performance due to excellent CO2 adsorption capacity, photoinduced electron/hole separation, and electron&#8208;transport efficiency.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can be implemented to use CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a resource in an energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly way, in which suitable catalytic materials are required to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Insufficient accessible active sites on the catalyst surface and inhibited electron transfer severely limit the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, porous aerogels are constructed from composites comprising different ratios of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide (NixCoy) grown on reduced graphene oxide (GR) into a hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure using a facile in situ growth method. Detailed characterization shows that this structure exposes numerous active sites for enhanced adsorption&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Moreover, under the synergistic effect of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide, the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as charge&#8208;carrier separation and transfer are excellent. As a result, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.

         <title>Dendrimersome Synthetic Cells Harbor Cell Division Machinery of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. The interactions between this active cell machinery and the synthetic membrane are tailored by adjusting its composition. Such fine&#8208;tuning enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system and constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements.








Abstract
The integration of active cell machinery with synthetic building blocks is the bridge toward developing synthetic cells with biological functions and beyond. Self&#8208;replication is one of the most important tasks of living systems, and various complex machineries exist to execute it. In Escherichia coli, a contractile division ring is positioned to mid&#8208;cell by concentration oscillations of self&#8208;organizing proteins (MinCDE), where it severs membrane and cell wall. So far, the reconstitution of any cell division machinery has exclusively been tied to liposomes. Here, the reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. By tuning the membrane composition, the interaction of biological machinery with synthetic membranes can be tailored to reproduce its dynamic behavior. This constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements, as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering emergent biological behavior from the bottom&#8208;up.

         <title>Designing a Redox Heterojunction for Photocatalytic &#8220;Overall Nitrogen Fixation&#8221; under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>

In a heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in different components, realizing synchronous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products&#8212;photocatalytic &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221; reactions.








Abstract
Ammonia and nitrates are the most fundamental and significant raw ingredients in human society. Till now, industrial synthetic ammonia by Haber&#8211;Bosch process and industrial synthetic nitrates by the Ostwald process have encountered increasingly serious challenges, i.e., high energy consumption, high cost, and environment&#8208;harmful gas emissions. Therefore, developing alternative approaches to achieve nitrogen fixation to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the well&#8208;established Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald processes has fascinated scientists for many years, especially the simultaneous formation of ammonia and nitrate directly from N2 molecules, which has been rarely studied. Herein, a heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system is designed to successfully achieve &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation,&#8221; a sustainable and simultaneous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products under mild conditions. In this heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CdS and WO3 components. As a result, N2 molecules can be activated and reduced to ammonia products with yields of 35.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a multi&#8208;electron process, and synchronously oxidized into nitrate products with yields of 14.2&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a hole&#8208;induced oxidation coupling process. This work provides a novel insight and promising approach to realize artificial nitrogen fixation under mild condition.

         <title>Twisting Linear to Orbital Angular Momentum in an Ultrasonic Motor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact ultrasonic motor built with a meta engine block that enables high&#8208;efficiency momentum twisting and contactless rotation of sound&#8208;absorbing objects is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Without dependence on multiple sources or geometric symmetry, this passive device deeply simplifies the orbital angular momentum production in 2D acoustic systems and offers new possibilities for the miniaturization and integration of vortex devices.








Abstract
An ultrasonic motor built with a contactless meta engine block (MEB) is designed and experimentally demonstrated for twisting the linear momentum of sound emanating from a Helmholtz resonator&#8208;based metasurface into orbital angular momentum (OAM). The MEB is capable of hosting highly efficient excitations of eigenmodes carrying desired OAM whose Bessel acoustic intensity patterns are enhanced by over ten times compared to the incident wave. Thanks to this efficiency, bidirectional ultrasonic OAM is capable of driving loads at speeds up to 1000&#160;rpm at 4 W and remarkable sound radiation torque levels. Moreover, the possibility of using arbitrarily shaped MEBs is also demonstrated by engineering its physical boundary condition based on an analytically derived criterion to guarantee the high twisting efficiency of man&#8208;made OAM. The results show how noninvasive driving of an ultrasonic motor can be made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

         <title>A Stacked Plasmonic Metamaterial with Strong Localized Electric Field Enables Highly Efficient Broadband Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by coupling a broadband plasmonic metamaterial absorber with a single Cu atoms based alloy as catalytic sites. The design perfectly synergizes the effects of photothermal conversion, plasmonic hot electrons, and strong localized electric field.








Abstract
Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO2 photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that are implemented in such an application are restricted in a narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with a designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, a concept of coupling a Au&#8208;based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites, respectively, is reported for gas&#8208;phase light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in a broad spectral range (370&#8211;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, and also induces strong localized electric field in favor of transfer of hot electrons and reduced energy barrier in CO2 hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of a strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light&#8208;driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Melting and Solvation Reconfiguration of Phase&#8208;Change Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous CO2 can promote the melting and reconfigure the solvation structure of a phase&#8208;change electrolyte, thereby enhancing interactions between salt anions and Li+ cations to upgrade the solid electrolyte interphase layer. Ultimately, a Li&#8211;LiFePO4 battery with CO2&#8208;saturated electrolyte exhibits prolonged cycle life. Furthermore, a Li&#8211;CO2 battery with the baseline electrolyte can cycle stably for nearly 100 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are a unique and exciting class of materials with bright prospects in wide&#8208;ranging sustainable technologies such as thermal and electrochemical energy storage. While impressive, the effect of gaseous species on PCMs remains largely unexplored hitherto. Here, a gaseous co&#8208;solvent is reported that can facilitate melting and modulate physical properties such as viscosity and ion conduction of PCMs. Especially for the appealing application of PCMs as electrolytes, gaseous species also have a critical influence on both Li+&#8208;electrolyte structure and resultant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, theoretical simulations and experimental analysis evidence that CO2 can promote melting while reconfiguring the solvation structure of a succinonitrile (SCL)&#8208;derived Li+ phase&#8208;change electrolyte (Li+&#8208;PCE) model system. Due to the enhanced interaction between Li+ cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) anions in the reconfigured solvation structure, more TFSI&#8208;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich component and extra CO2&#8208;derived Li2CO3 form in the upgraded SEI layer, thereby endowing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Li&#8208;metal batteries with prolonged cyclability. These findings may stimulate widespread interest in gas leverage to innovate electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Polarization Engineering of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Molecular Oxygen and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Thio)urea&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are rationally designed, showing an outstanding photocatalytic activity toward production of H2O2 in water (3268.1 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with a quantum yield of 8.6% at 400 nm for the thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF) via reducing molecular oxygen (O2). This is much higher than most of the reported metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts in nonsacrificial systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is seriously inhibited by its sluggish charge kinetics. Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF (Bpt&#8208;CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc&#8208;CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400&#160;nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional&#8208;groups&#8208;mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Dynamic Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Tunable Handedness and Intensity Enabled by Achiral Dichroic Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes, P1 and N1, are designed as anisotropic chromophores in the long and short molecular axes with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl derivatives in SLC1717 medium. Dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) handedness and intensity are achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are chiral supramolecular systems that self&#8208;assemble into a highly regular helical arrangement in a liquid crystal (LC) medium. Such an arrangement is highly beneficial for the chiral enlargement effect on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Dichroic dyes with rod&#8208;like molecular structures can exhibit fluorescence anisotropy along both the long and short molecular axes owing to their transition dipole moment (TDM) vectors. In this work, a pair of donor&#8211;accepter (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes is prepared, namely, 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene derivative (P1, whose TDM vector is parallel to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&gt; F&#8869;) and anthraquinone derivative (N1, whose TDM vector is perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&lt; F&#8869;). CLCs can be fabricated by doping P1 or N1 together with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;derived inducers into SLC1717 medium. Dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity is achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity enabled by TDM regulation of achiral dichroic dyes in a CLC medium.

         <dc:description>
A precise site&#8208;dependent photonic material has the ability of modifying momentum&#8208;space properties and maintaining the coherence of bulk states in transport. Artificial honeycomb lattices with an effective force are constructed to realize highly controllable Zener tunneling and the coherence protection of particles transmitting on artificial quantum materials.








Abstract
Quantum coherence is the central element of particle states, and it characterizes the overall performance of various quantum materials. Bloch oscillation is a fundamental coherent behavior of particles under a static potential, which can be easily destroyed by Zener tunneling in multiband 2D lattice materials. The control of Zener tunneling therefore plays the key role in quantum engineering for complicated physical systems. Here, the inhibition and reconstruction of Zener tunneling in photonic honeycomb lattices are experimentally demonstrated. &#160;Deformed honeycomb lattices are integrated and an effective static potential is realized on the 2D lattice materials. Zener tunneling disappears in stretch&#8208;type lattices and wave packets stay in the dispersionless upper energy band. On the contrary, Zener tunneling is greatly enhanced in compression&#8208;type lattices and wave packets exhibit directional oscillations without branches, which manifest the preserved coherence of the wave packets. The results demonstrate the protection of photonic coherence by structurally controlling the Zener tunneling, representing a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum&#160;materials.

&lt;p&gt;A precise site-dependent photonic material has the ability of modifying momentum-space properties and maintaining the coherence of bulk states in transport. Artificial honeycomb lattices with an effective force are constructed to realize highly controllable Zener tunneling and the coherence protection of particles transmitting on artificial quantum materials.

         <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Aqueous Colloidal Suspensions: Evidence of Density Inversion at the Isotropic&#8208;Liquid Crystal Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new low&#8208;density liquid crystalline (LC) phase in aqueous colloidal suspensions of rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is demonstrated. This behavior is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal CNCs/water interactions. The scale bar in the image is 100&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The colloidal suspensions of aqueous cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to form liquid crystalline (LC) systems above certain critical concentrations. From an isotropic phase, tactoid formation, growth, and sedimentation have been determined as the genesis of a high&#8208;density cholesteric phase, which, after drying, originates solid iridescent films. Herein, the coexistence of a liquid crystal upper phase and an isotropic bottom phase in CNC aqueous suspensions at the isotropic&#8211;nematic phase separation is reported. Furthermore, isotropic spindle&#8208;like domains are observed in the low&#8208;density LC phase and high&#8208;density LC phases are also prepared. The CNCs isolated from the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density LC phases are found to have similar average lengths, diameters, and surface charges. The existence of an LC low&#8208;density phase is explained by the presence of air dissolved in the water present within the CNCs. The air dissolves out when the water solidifies into ice and remains within the CNCs. The self&#8208;adjustment of the cellulose chain conformation enables the entrapment of air within the CNCs and CNC buoyancy in aqueous suspensions.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Line&#8208;Guided Growth of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slip lines on metal surfaces are found to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of graphene. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the orientation of graphene grown on a variety of metal facets, further enabling the controllable synthesis of single&#8208;crystal graphene and grain&#8208;boundary engineering of bicrystal graphene on designed metal facets.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging 2D materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process is demonstrated on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. Not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bicrystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations, are successfully synthesized by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bicrystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8776;21&#176; and &#8776;11&#176; are constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bicrystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Enhanced Dual&#8208;Directional Sulfur Redox via a Biotemplated Single&#8208;Atomic Fe&#8211;N2 Mediator Promises Durable Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8211;N2 single&#8208;atomic catalyst accommodated by a biomorphic hierarchical C3N4 support from a biomass template readily boosts the dual&#8208;directional conversion kinetics of lithium sulfide and realizes high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is considered as an appealing candidate for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of high energy and low cost. Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single&#8208;atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (&#8776;6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA&#8208;CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA&#8208;CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA&#8208;CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li&#8211;S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Activatable Cancer Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy using Semiconducting Polymer Nanobodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanobody (SPNAb) is developed for cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Ultrasound irradiation of SPNAb can not only induce immunogenic cell death by sonodynamic therapy but also activate anti&#8208;CTLA4 antibodies to in situ trigger checkpoint blockade, resulting in enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Despite the great promises of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combination cancer therapy, its clinical applications are hindered by the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activities of therapeutic agents and the lack of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, the development of semiconducting polymers as efficient sonosensitizers and further development of sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanobodies (SPNAb) for activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. Conjugation of anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies onto the polymer nanoparticles through a 1O2&#8208;cleavable linker affords SPNAb with relatively low CTLA&#8208;4 binding affinity. Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNAb generates 1O2 not only to elicit a sonodynamic effect to induce immunogenic cell death, but also to release anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies and trigger in situ checkpoint blockade. Such a synergistic therapeutic action mediated by SPNAb modulates the tumoricidal function of T&#8208;cell immunity by promoting the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, resulting in effective tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, durable immunological memory, and prevention of relapse. Therefore, this study represents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sonodynamic strategy using semiconducting polymers for precise spatiotemporal control over immunotherapy.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy and Safe Lithium Battery Enabled by Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry in a Fireproof Gel Electrolyte</title>

Solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of a molecular Li2S cathode and Si anode in a fireproof gel electrolyte enables a high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery with long life, good temperature adaptability, negligible self&#8208;discharge, and remarkable safety against extreme abuse in the air, water, or even on fire.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed thriving efforts in pursuing high&#8208;energy batteries at an unaffordable cost of safety. Herein, a high&#8208;energy and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery is proposed by solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of polymer&#8208;based molecular Li2S cathode in a fireproof gel electrolyte. This chemistry fully eliminates not only the negative effect of extremely reactive Li metal and oxygen species on cell safety but also the damage of electrode reversibility by soluble redox intermediates. The molecular Li2S cathode exhibits an exceptional lifetime of 2000 cycles, 100% Coulombic efficiency, high capacity of 830 mA&#160;h g&#8722;1 with ultralow capacity loss of 0.005&#8211;0.01% per cycle and superior rate capability up to 10 C. Meanwhile, it shows high stability in the carbonate&#8208;involving electrolyte for maximizing the compatibility with carbonate&#8208;efficient Si anode. The optimized cell chemistry exerts high energy over 750&#160;W&#160;h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles with fast rate response, high&#8208;temperature adaptability, and no self&#8208;discharge. A fire&#8208;retardant composite gel electrolyte is developed to further strengthen the intrinsic safe redox between the Li2S cathode and the Si anode, which secures remarkable safety against extreme abuse of overheating, short circuits, and mechanical damage in air/water or even when on fire.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electroplating for Aqueous Zinc Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;metal anodes, which are desirable for various aqueous zinc battery chemistries, degrade over repeated cycling due to dendrite growth. It is found that dendrites can be prevented by ensuring no defective regions form during zinc deposition, thus removing sites for dendrite nucleation and ensuring purely planar deposition. This allows unprecedentedly high charging rates to be achieved.








Abstract
Despite being one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;level energy storage, practical aqueous zinc batteries are limited by dendrite formation, which leads to significantly compromised safety and cycling performance. In this study, by using single&#8208;crystal Zn&#8208;metal anodes, reversible electrodeposition of planar Zn with a high capacity of 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at an unprecedentedly high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This dendrite&#8208;free electrode is well maintained even after prolonged cycling (&gt;1200 cycles at 50 mA cm&#8722;2). Such excellent electrochemical performance is due to single&#8208;crystal Zn suppressing the major sources of defect generation during electroplating and heavily favoring planar deposition morphologies. As so few defect sites form, including those that would normally be found along grain boundaries or to accommodate lattice mismatch, there is little opportunity for dendritic structures to nucleate, even under extreme plating rates. This scarcity of defects is in part due to perfect atomic&#8208;stitching between merging Zn islands, ensuring no defective shallow&#8208;angle grain boundaries are formed and thus removing a significant source of non&#8208;planar Zn nucleation. It is demonstrated that an ideal high&#8208;rate Zn anode should offer perfect lattice matching as this facilitates planar epitaxial Zn growth and minimizes the formation of any defective regions.

         <title>Integrating Bi@C Nanospheres in Porous Hard Carbon Frameworks for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D carbon framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres wrapped by a carbon layer (Bi@C&#8834;CFs) is synthesized via thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework nanorods. Due to this novel and unique architecture design, the hybrid electrode indicates superior electrochemical performance as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative technology because of their merits in abundance and cost. Realizing their real applications, however, remains a formidable challenge. One is that among the limitations of anode materials, the alloy&#8208;type candidates tolerate fast capacity fading during cycling. Here, a 3D framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with a metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated carbon layer by thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanorods is synthesized as an anode material for SIBs. Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design promotes excellent sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity of 308.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of a homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Importantly, deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the performance improvement is illuminated, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.

         <title>Microstructured Hydrogels to Guide Self&#8208;Assembly and Function of Lung Alveolospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epithelial cell organoids provide a system to probe tissue development and disease in vitro and for cell transplantation. Within the lung field, alveolar organoids almost exclusively depend on Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions. In this work, the design of an accessible hydrogel system with predefined microcavities to generate alveolar organoids through self&#8208;assembly and maintenance of progenitor cell fate and function is described.








Abstract
Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within 3D Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, a method is described that relies on hyaluronic acid hydrogels for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self&#8208;assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel&#8208;free conditions. By engineering predefined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure is reduced when compared to 3D culture, while maintaining the alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2&#8208;derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible system for the culture of iPSC&#8208;derived lung progenitors and the method can be expanded to the culture of primary mouse tissue derived AT2 and other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.

Melt electrowriting&#8208;printed thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) scaffolds with biomimetic geometry are integrated into customized microscopy&#8208;compliant bioreactor. Filling of the bioreactor with a hydrogel precursor solution induces fusion of adjacent filaments in the scaffolds (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Subsequent temperature decrease below the lower critical solution temperature produces perfusable microchannels with circular cross&#8208;sections, biomimetic volume&#8208;ratio between mother and daughter channels, and leakage&#8208;free fluid connection that enable rapid endothelialization.








Abstract
A facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels is presented. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using melt electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. The aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#160;&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that are deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes that approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Intrinsically High Magnetic Performance in Core&#8211;Shell Structural (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;Based Permanent Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) in (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;based magnet is demonstrated via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process, resulting in the relatively high anisotropy field of 9.24 T in the optimized alloy. It provides an innovative strategy and has important significance for the design of high&#8208;performance magnets.








Abstract
ThMn12&#8208;type SmFe12&#8208;based permanent magnets have exhibited great potential in advanced magnet motors because of their high temperature stability of magnetic properties. However, the applications could be seriously limited due to the trade&#8208;off between phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties. In this work, an effective solution is demonstrated by constructing the core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process. The anisotropy field for the (Sm0.75Y0.25)(Fe0.8Co0.2)11.25Ti0.75 alloy is mostly optimized to be 9.24 T at room temperature. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the pinning process of domain walls by the magnetic&#8208;hardening Sm&#8208;rich shell, which is directly observed by in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and reconstructed by micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, the phase stability and saturation magnetization are simultaneously increased, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Y, Co, and Ti substitutions. More importantly, the high &#956;0Ms value of 1.52 T is comparable to the reported (Sm,Zr)Fe12&#8208;based bulk alloys that contain a larger amount of soft &#945;&#8208;Fe phases, indicating that this strategy is more promising toward bulk magnets. The present study provides a significant concept for the development of advanced permanent magnets and also has implications for understanding the structural origin of intrinsic magnetic configurations.

         <title>Enhancing Transition Dipole Moments of Heterocyclic Semiconductors via Rational Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution for Sensitive Near Infrared Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic semiconductors with stretched geometry show enhanced transition dipole moments, leading to large absorption coefficients of up to 4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1 beyond 900&#160;nm in thin films. The self&#8208;powered organic photodetectors in this work show high detectivity (1012 to 2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones) over a broad spectrum of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm, comparable with some commercial inorganic photodetectors.








Abstract
Designing ultrastrong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing organic semiconductors is a critical prerequisite for sensitive NIR thin film organic photodetectors (OPDs), especially in the region of beyond 900&#160;nm, where the absorption coefficient of commercial single crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) is below 103 cm&#8722;1. Herein, a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic core (named as BPPT) with strong electron&#8208;donating property and stretched geometry is developed. Relative to their analogue Y6, BPPT&#8208;contained molecules, BPPT&#8208;4F and BPPT&#8208;4Cl, show substantially upshifted and more delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals, and larger transition dipole moments, leading to bathochromic and hyperchromic absorption spectra extending beyond 1000&#160;nm with very large absorption coefficients (up to 3.7&#8211;4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) as thin films. These values are much higher than those (104 to 1 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) of typical organic semiconductors, and 1&#8211;2 orders higher than those of commercial inorganic materials, such as c&#8208;Si, Ge, and InGaAs. The OPDs based on BPPT&#8208;4F or BPPT&#8208;4Cl blending polymer PBDB&#8208;T show high detectivity of above 1012 Jones in a wide wavelength range of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm with excellent peak values of 1.3&#8211;2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones, respectively, which are comparable with and even better than those commercial inorganic photodetectors.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Pathway on Spinel Oxides via Surficial Geometrical&#8208;Site Occupation Modification Driven by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production, which proceeds via four&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron pathways, respectively. Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&#8722; or the 2e&#8722; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo2O4 can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated as a critical technology for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production. Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo2O4 oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; ORR. Interestingly, the as&#8208;synthesized MnCo2O4&#8208;pristine (MnCo2O4&#8208;P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75&#160;V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo2O4&#8208;activation (MnCo2O4&#8208;A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four&#8208;electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92&#160;V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo2O4&#8208;A toward the 4e&#8722; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-A toward the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unusual Mesoporous Titanium Niobium Oxides Realizing Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual mesoporous titanium niobium oxides@carbon (Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C) with large pore sizes and highly crystallized nanocrystals embedded in carbon frameworks are synthesized via a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy. As an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C shows exceptional performances at room temperature and even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, the sluggish ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics brought by the large radius of Na+ seriously limits the performance of SIBs, let alone at low temperatures. Herein, a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize unusual Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C for high&#8208;performance SIBs operating at room and low temperatures is proposed. The confinement self&#8208;assembly of the acid&#8211;base pair around the micelles and confined crystallization by the carbon layer realize the formation of ordered and stoichiometric mesoporous frameworks with opened ion channels. Thus, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics at 25 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which are one order higher than that of the nonporous one. A high reversible capacity of 233 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate (a specific capacity of 103 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and cycling performances (&lt;0.03% fading per cycle) can be observed at 25&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8211;x@C can still deliver the 161 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 60% and outstanding cycling stability (99 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles). It is believed this strategy opens a new avenue for constructing novel mesoporous electrode materials for low&#8208;temperature energy storage.

         <title>Recyclable, Healable, and Tough Ionogels Insensitive to Crack Propagation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irreversible covalent crosslinking in the matrix polymer network is avoided. The reversible entangled microdomains of the microspheres and linear segments in tough ionogels act as elastic physical crosslinking points to provide mechanical stability, dissipate stress concentration, and prevent crack propagation in any load direction. The entangled networks can be disentangled to restore the damaged mechanical properties and realize recycling.








Abstract
Most gels and elastomers introduce sacrificial bonds in the covalent network to dissipate energy. However, long&#8208;term cyclic loading caused irreversible fatigue damage and crack propagation cannot be prevented. Furthermore, because of the irreversible covalent crosslinked networks, it is a huge challenge to implement reversible mechanical interlocking and reorganize the polymer segments to realize the recycling and reuse of ionogels. Here, covalent crosslinking of host materials is replaced with entanglement. The entangled microdomains are used as physical crosslinking while introducing reversible bond interactions. The interpenetrating, entangled, and elastic microdomains of linear segments and covalent&#8208;network microspheres provide mechanical stability, eliminate stress concentration at the crack tip under load, and achieve unprecedented tear and fatigue resistance of ionogels in any load direction. Moreover, reversible entanglements and noncovalent interactions can be disentangled and recombined to achieve recycling and mechanical regeneration, and the recyclability of covalent&#8208;network microdomains is realized.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Modules via Bilayer&#8208;Merged&#8208;Annealing Assisted Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic solar modules by blade coating are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing strategy, achieving impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.79% with an active area of 18.73 cm2, which represents the best organic solar minimodule by blade coating so far.








Abstract
Although encouraging progress is being made on spin&#8208;coated prototype cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) still face significant challenges, yet to be explored, for upscaling the multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers in the construction of large&#8208;area modules. Herein, high&#8208;performance opaque and semitransparent organic solar modules are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing (BMA)&#8208;assisted blade&#8208;coating strategy, achieving impressive efficiencies of 14.79% and 12.01% with respect to active area of 18.73 cm2, which represent the best organic solar minimodules so far. It is revealed that the BMA strategy effectively resolves the de&#8208;wetting issues between polar charge transport layer solution and non&#8208;polar bulk heterojunction blends, hence improving the film coverage, along with electronic and electric contacts of multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers. As result, organic solar modules coated under ambient conditions successfully retain the high&#8208;efficiency of small&#8208;area cells upon 312 times area scaling&#8208;up. Overall, this work provides a facile and effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar modules under ambient conditions.

         <title>Energy Conversion Analysis of Multilayered Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Synergistic Rain and Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance instantaneous triboelectric nanogenerator (I&#8208;TENG) and a quantitative analysis method named &#8220;kinetic energy calculation and current integration&#8221; (KECCI) are developed to promote the understanding of energy flows and working principles of TENGs in&#8208;depth. Furthermore, multi&#8208;layered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics to work synergistically. This work guides the further development of TENG and promotes its commercialization process.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology that offers excellent potential for the conversion of mechanical energy from rain into electricity for hybrid energy applications. However, a high&#8208;performance TENG is yet to be achieved because a quantitative analysis method for the energy conversion process is still lacking. Herein, a quantitative analysis method, termed the "kinetic energy calculation and current integration" (KECCI) method, which significantly improves the understanding of the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion process, is presented. Based on the KECCI method, a high&#8208;performance TENG is developed by systematically optimizing a biomimetic surface structure and instant switch design, with 1.25&#160;mA short&#8208;circuit current (Isc), 150&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), and a high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 24.89%. Furthermore, a multilayered TENG device is proposed for continuously harvesting the kinetic energy of raindrops for further improvement in the energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Finally, the multilayered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics, achieving all&#8208;weather energy harvesting. This work presents a validated theoretical basis that will guide further development of TENGs toward higher performances, which will promote the commercialization of hybrid TENG systems for all&#8208;weather applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology that offers excellent potential for the conversion of mechanical energy from rain into electricity for hybrid energy applications. However, a high-performance TENG is yet to be achieved because a quantitative analysis method for the energy conversion process is still lacking. Herein, a quantitative analysis method, termed the "kinetic energy calculation and current integration" (KECCI) method, which significantly improves the understanding of the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion process, is presented. Based on the KECCI method, a high-performance TENG is developed by systematically optimizing a biomimetic surface structure and instant switch design, with 1.25&#160;mA short-circuit current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;), 150&#160;V open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;), and a high energy-conversion efficiency of 24.89%. Furthermore, a multilayered TENG device is proposed for continuously harvesting the kinetic energy of raindrops for further improvement in the energy-conversion efficiency. Finally, the multilayered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics, achieving all-weather energy harvesting. This work presents a validated theoretical basis that will guide further development of TENGs toward higher performances, which will promote the commercialization of hybrid TENG systems for all-weather applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Acoustic Meta&#8208;Engine
In article number 2201575, Bin Liang, Jian&#8208;Chun Cheng, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers report a metasurface&#8208;inspired compact motor that is capable of converting linear to angular momentum for audible and ultrasonic waves. With speed of up to 1000 rpm, noninvasive driving is made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

(Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;Based Magnets
In article number 2203503, Xuefeng Zhang, Wei Li, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the construction of a core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) in a (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;based magnet via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process, resulting in the synchronous enhancement of magnetic properties and phase stability in the optimized alloy. An innovative strategy is thus provided, which has important significance for the design of high&#8208;performance magnets.

Bacterial Cell Division
In article number 2202364, Petra Schwille, Cesar Rodriguez&#8208;Emmenegger, and co&#8208;workers show the reconstitution of a bacterial divisome in fully synthetic dendrimersomes. The fine&#8208;tuning of interactions between the active cell machinery and synthetic membrane enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system. This constitutes a breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering biological behavior and beyond.

Zener Tunneling
In article number 2110044, Xian&#8208;Min Jin and co&#8208;workers report the realization of highly controllable Zener tunneling for protecting photonic coherence. The excited photonic states flow collectively along the energy band due to almost&#8208;total Zener tunneling, below which the excited states on the lattice materials undergo a directionally oscillating trajectory, directly associated with the above energy band. These results represent a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum materials.

Cellulose Nanocrystals
Rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystal aqueous colloidal suspensions can be prepared from eucalyptus kraft pulp. In article number 2108227, Maria Helena Godinho and co&#8208;workers show the formation of a liquid crystalline (LC) phase atop an isotropic phase, inverted from the typical high&#8208;density LC phase. The bounciness of the particles is attributed to the presence of air. The behavior observed is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal cellulose nanocrystal/water interactions.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Intercalation Chemistry for the Synthesis and Modification of Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation chemistry is extensively investigated to synthesize and modulate 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with atomic thickness due to the diverse host&#8211;guest configurations and impact in their layered framework. Recent advances regarding 2D TMD materials, through intercalation exfoliation, from the views of host, guest, and solvent, are reviewed.








Abstract
Intercalation chemistry is of great importance in solid&#8208;state physics and chemistry for the ability to modulate electronic structures for constructing new materials with exotic properties. This ancient and versatile discipline has recently become prevailing in the synthesis and regulation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with atomic thickness due to diverse host&#8211;guest configurations and their impact on layered frameworks, which bring in extensive applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and other energy&#8208;based devices. In order to prepare 2D TMD materials with desired structure and properties, it is essential to gain in&#8208;depth understanding of the key role the intercalation chemistry plays in the preparation process. A focused review on recent advances regarding 2D TMD materials through intercalation exfoliation from the view of host, guest, and solvent interactions is provided. The effect of intercalation chemistry on TMD nanosheets synthesis and modification is comprehensively reviewed. The interactions between host and guest from the aspects of lattice strain, interlayer distance, and carrier density are considered. Finally, a prospectus of the future research opportunities for the intercalation chemistry of 2D materials is provided.

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive review comprises recent development in direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) 3D printing technology for the development of 3D structures from various materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and multimaterials. The work describes the fundamentals and engineering of ink rheology required for DIW. In addition, a multitude of applications, current challenges, and future prospects of the technology are discussed.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile 3D printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing is presented. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries are discussed. Finally, the current challenges and limitations of this technique are highlighted, followed by its prospects as&#160;a&#160;guideline toward possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Application of Nanostructured TiO2 in UV Photodetectors: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 28, July 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured TiO2 application in UV photodetectors is been comprehensively reviewed. More importantly, an in&#8208;depth illustration of optoelectronic properties and technological issues is discussed in detail. This review provides a roadmap for material design and functional application for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
As a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor material, titanium dioxide (TiO2), which possesses three crystal polymorphs (i.e., rutile, anatase, and brookite), has gained tremendous attention as a cutting&#8208;edge material for application in the environment and energy fields. Based on the strong attractiveness from its advantages such as high stability, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost fabrication, the construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors (PDs) based on TiO2 nanostructures is being extensively developed. An elaborate microtopography and device configuration is the most widely used strategy to achieve efficient TiO2&#8208;based PDs with high photoelectric performances; however, a deep understanding of all the key parameters that influence the behavior of photon&#8208;generated carriers, is also highly required to achieve improved photoelectric performances, as well as their ultimate functional applications. Herein, an in&#8208;depth illustration of the electrical and optical properties of TiO2 nanostructures in addition to the advances in the technological issues such as preparation, microdefects, p&#8208;type doping, bandgap engineering, heterojunctions, and functional applications are presented. Finally, a future outlook for TiO2&#8208;based PDs, particularly that of further functional applications is provided. This work will systematically illustrate the fundamentals of TiO2 and shed light on the preparation of more efficient TiO2 nanostructures and heterojunctions for future photoelectric applications.

         <title>Effect of magnetic impurities on superconductivity in LaH10</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyhydrides are a novel class of superconducting materials with extremely high critical parameters, which is very promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, complete experimental study of the best so far known superconductor, lanthanum superhydride LaH10, encounters a serious complication because of the large upper critical magnetic field HC2(0), exceeding 120&#8211;160&#160;T. W e found that partial replacement of La atoms by magnetic Nd atoms results in significant suppression of superconductivity in LaH10: each atomic % of Nd causes decrease in TC by 10&#8211;11&#160;K, helping us to control the critical parameters of this compound. Strong pulsed magnetic fields up to 68&#160;T w ere used to study the Hall effect, magnetoresistance and the magnetic phase diagram of ternary metal polyhydrides for the first time. Surprisingly, (La,Nd)H10 demonstrates completely linear HC2(T)&#160;&#8733;&#160;|T&#160;&#8211;&#160;TC|, which calls into question the applicability of the Werthamer&#8211;Helfand&#8211;Hohenberg model for polyhydrides. The suppression of superconductivity in LaH10 by magnetic Nd atoms and the robustness of TC with respect to nonmagnetic impurities (e.g., Y, Al, C) under Anderson's theorem gives new experimental evidence of the isotropic (s&#8208;wave) character of conventional electron&#8208;phonon pairing in the lanthanum superhydride.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high porous MgO micro&#8208;particles for heat energy storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by the industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy. Among such systems, the hydration and dehydration reactions of MgO/Mg(OH)2 are eco&#8208;friendly, have relatively low toxicity and risk, and have a large reserves. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for a heat storage system. In this study, ultra&#8208;high porous particles were used to maximize the heat storage efficiency of pure MgO. Due to its large surface area, the heat storage rate was 90.3% of the theoretical value and the reaction rate was very high. In addition, as structural collapse, likely to be caused by volume changes between reactions, is blocked as the porous region is filled and emptied, the cycle stability is secured. Ultra&#8208;high porous MgO micro&#8208;particles can be used to build eco&#8208;friendly heat storage systems.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in Seawater Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by the low N2 solubility in electrolyte while the large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst could also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for NRR. Here, we report that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8208;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8208;acceptor based conjugated polymers is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time to suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it was found that a semi&#8208;crystalline conjugated polymer catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations revealed the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8208;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of non&#8208;volatile memory, memristor technology and electronic components with ultra&#8208;small feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. We demonstrate the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modelling, we clarify the contribution of domain walls within the bulk and show the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain wall based technology.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micron&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for the ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, we develop a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude, by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is mainly contributed to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8764;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8764;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254 dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables to be used in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring and human&#8208;computer interaction.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risk from cross infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8208;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by human puts forward a high demand for the photodetection performance. Here, we construct a SrTiO3&#8208;x/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gesture, numbers and letters in real time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into the noncontact human&#8208;machine interaction system.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced By Pyro&#8208;phototronic Effect Based On A Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect existed in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost 10 times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA/mW, which is &#8764;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Unity of Opposites between Soluble and Insoluble Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on Li&#8211;S chemistry show promise as possible for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices because of their ultra&#8208;high capacities and energy densities. Research over the past decade has demonstrated that the morphology of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in electrolytes (soluble or insoluble) plays a decisive role in battery performance. Early studies have focused mainly on inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs and invested considerable effort to realize this objective. However, in recent years, a completely different view has emerged that the dissolution of LPSs during battery discharge/charge should be promoted. At this critical juncture in the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;S batteries, it is time to summarize and discuss both sides of the contradiction. This perspective provides an overview of these two opposite views pertaining to soluble and insoluble LPSs, including their historical environment, classical strategies, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the future morphology of LPSs in Li&#8211;S batteries is predicted based on a multi&#8208;angle review of research studies conducted thus far, and the reasoning behind this conjecture is thoroughly discussedi.

&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable batteries based on Li&#8211;S chemistry show promise as possible for next-generation energy storage devices because of their ultra-high capacities and energy densities. Research over the past decade has demonstrated that the morphology of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in electrolytes (soluble or insoluble) plays a decisive role in battery performance. Early studies have focused mainly on inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs and invested considerable effort to realize this objective. However, in recent years, a completely different view has emerged that the dissolution of LPSs during battery discharge/charge should be promoted. At this critical juncture in the large-scale application of Li&#8211;S batteries, it is time to summarize and discuss both sides of the contradiction. This perspective provides an overview of these two opposite views pertaining to soluble and insoluble LPSs, including their historical environment, classical strategies, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the future morphology of LPSs in Li&#8211;S batteries is predicted based on a multi-angle review of research studies conducted thus far, and the reasoning behind this conjecture is thoroughly discussedi.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monolayer SixCy, constitutes an important family of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable band gaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with layered structure, fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, we report the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates. A combination of scanning&#8208;tunneling&#8208;microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray&#8208;photoelectron&#8208;spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a band gap of &#8764;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;based Micro&#8208;nano Fibers Via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts are of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers towards room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, we report interfacial engineering enhanced thermoelectric properties of micro&#8208;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8764;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#956;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Electroconductive, Adhesive, Non&#8208;swelling, and Viscoelastic Hydrogels for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogel through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non&#8208;swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low&#8208;current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel has demonstrated a tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8208;electronics interfaces, promising next&#8208;generation bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic non&#8208;collinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. Spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly non&#8208;collinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of non&#8208;collinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound&#8208;Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System Using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well&#8208;classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system, which automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their two&#8208;dimensional limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many two&#8208;dimensional semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, we review the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. We discuss the advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials. Then, we project for the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements, studying the physics of two&#8208;dimensional materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Single&#8208;crystalline Perovskite p&#8208;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>

Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8208;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realize sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8208;n junction photodetectors based on organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices are generally made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, we demonstrate a type of ultrasensitive photodetectors based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8208;n junction nanowire arrays. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8208;n junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405&#160;nm to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65 &#215; 102 A/W at 532&#160;nm. These results would provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A room temperature ferroelectric resonant tunnelling diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resonant tunnelling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunnelling diode exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, we report the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunnelling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviours in all perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tuneable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8764;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy band gap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8208;electron correlations, as follows from our density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Our study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunnelling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>

Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique three&#8208;dimensional (3D) geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissue. Using 1.4&#8208;nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissue are labeled, and then nanogold acts as nucleation sites for metal particle growth. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

         <title>Rapid Ultra&#8208;Tough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#8208;COOH and &#8208;NH2 groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, we show that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultra&#8208;tough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000J/m2) in 5&#8211;10mins without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion was shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000J/m2 in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Exposing Single&#8208;Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, we report the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single&#8208;Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>

Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, we achieve the controlled formation of conduction channels with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. Our work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ge Bidirectional Diffusion to Simultaneously Engineer Back Interface and Bulk Defects in the Absorber for Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe2 at the back interface, is realized by an easy&#8208;handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe2 is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge&#8208;involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.








Abstract
Aiming at a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a VOC of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multistep Targeting and Multistage Intervention Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform is proposed. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

A round&#8208;robin study involving 61 labs is performed, and it is shown that the determination of Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) areas from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI) is presented, which expands on the Rouquerol criteria, and which makes an unambiguous BET area calculation possible.








Abstract
Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was&#160;developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Despite its widespread use, the calculation of BET surface areas causes a spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, for this analysis, 18 already&#8208;measured raw adsorption isotherms were&#160;provided to sixty&#8208;one labs, who were&#160;asked to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round&#8208;robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values. Here, the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is demonstrated to be a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas. To solve this major issue, a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials is developed. The software, called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI), expands on the well&#8208;known Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8211;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capillary suction is a phenomenon in which surface tension spontaneously drives flow into confined geometries. This physics is leveraged to demonstrate a method for the passive assembly of soft materials using templated Hele&#8211;Shaw cells. These pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized patterns and material properties.








Abstract
Natural materials are highly organized, frequently possessing intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here, a new frugal methodology is reported to fabricate pixelated soft materials. This approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8211;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets to be tailored and thereby their local material&#160;properties to be tuned.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>A Unique Fe&#8211;N4 Coordination System Enabling Transformation of Oxygen into Superoxide for Photocatalytic C&#63743;H Activation with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. In this work, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride, that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C&#63743;H bonds is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. However, activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low&#8208;spin Fe&#8211;N4&#160;system (t2g6eg0) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O2, producing O2&#8226;&#8722;. The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O2&#8226;&#8722; ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C&#63743;H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic phase control is the source of fascinating correlated phenomena and the frontier research direction in materials science and spintronic devices. Magnetic anisotropy control and a dramatically enhanced Tc up to 400 K are realized in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 during a high&#8208;pressure loading&#8211;deloading process, shedding light on exploring the exchange interaction mechanism and realizing practical spintronic applications.








Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness toward novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8211;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>More Powerful Twistron Carbon Nanotube Yarn Mechanical Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7&#8208;fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12&#8208;fold those reported for previous materials&#8208;based technologies for key frequency ranges.








Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here, it is shown that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during precoiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1 and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation are 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, which are 24&#8208; and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz is over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1 and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays are stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>

         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastiff DNA&#8211;hydroxyapatite bulk composites are fabricated by in situ mineralization in a long&#8208;range ordered DNA scaffold. The as&#8208;prepared composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus and a long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial behavior. A new type of artificial dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial ability is thus developed for dental restoration applications.








Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, a facile strategy is developed for the fabrication of ultrastiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enables the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of 1D and 2D HAP minerals is thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus of &#8776;25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a&#160;new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties is developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endows the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic&#8208;Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale cavities of ultrathin (111)&#8208;exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d&#8208;band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long&#8208;serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, atomic&#8208;scale cavities (ASCs) are proposed as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and successfully introduced into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performance with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with &#8776;30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work highlights a new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8211;OH Bonds in a Catalyst Facilitates the Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is a complex reaction including electrochemical step and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process. The interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects of Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS enable the activated Ni2+&#8211;OH to exhibit an excellent NOR activity. More importantly, spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps, including proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, hydration, and rearrangement, lead to diverse nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation pathways of different NOR systems.








Abstract
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, the nonuniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For the NOR, involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni2+&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Integration of a Zinc Metasilicate Interface Layer Guiding Well&#8208;Regulated Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry strategy with industrial operability is developed to realize large&#8208;scale integration of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O nanosheet arrays on Zn foil. Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location electron microscopy characterization is designed to visualize and uncover the in situ integration mechanism of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O layer. The life spans of symmetric cells, and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the life span of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, new&#8208;type Zn&#8211;A&#8211;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties are developed to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8211;nucleation&#8211;growth&#8221; mechanism that is confirmed by a well&#8208;designed Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on a low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, the Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultralow polarization, the life spans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with a high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, are increased by 3&#8211;7 times with the Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation of Zn@ZSO foil contributes to a 0.5 Ah multilayer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospects for practical application.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

         <title>CsPbCl3&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Widened Bandgap and Inhibited Phase Segregation in a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and its Application to NiOx&#8208;Based Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

The bandgap of Cs0.22FA0.78Pb (I0.85Br0.15)3 is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding 3 mol% CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters. Adding extra 2 mol% CsCl can enrich Cl at the NiOx/perovskite interface, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface and improving the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. This enables efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCE up to 27.26%.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8211;i&#8211;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br &gt; 20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, the bandgap is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriches the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improves the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSC increases from 17.82% to 19.76%, which leads to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). The perovskite to an n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is also applied to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

A direct deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography method, which enables fabrication of microstructures in bulk polystyrene cell culture substrates, is presented. Pipelines for generating ink&#8208;based DUV masks and micropattern virtualization further increase the remarkable straightforwardness of the process. This, combined with the high applicability, can significantly improve accessibility of this class of microfabrication techniques to a broad biological research community.








Abstract
Tissue&#8208;culture&#8208;ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. An economical and easily accessible method is developed and validated for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5 and 10&#160;&#181;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via Binding&#8208;Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over a Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation strategy based on a Co&#8211;Cr cooperated single&#8208;atom Cr1/CoSe2 electrocatalyst is presented, turning the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction and styrene oxidation into mutual benefits via the migration of the *OOH intermediate from the Co to the Cr site, achieving an efficient and mild selective oxidation of styrene without any exogenous oxidizing reagent.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals; especially, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6&#160;VAg/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;Infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ identification of biomolecules in aqueous solutions by IR spectroscopy is important for exploring biological processes. However, the strong and broad IR absorption of water overwhelms the vibrations of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable graphene plasmonic aqueous IR biosensor is exploited to directly probe a protein's vibrations and characterize the deuterium effects, which provides a platform for studying nanoscale biological processes.








Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in situ and noninvasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad IR absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmons is exploited to identify &#8776;2&#160;nm&#8208;thick proteins in physiological conditions. The acquired in situ tunability makes it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8776;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

         <title>Targeted Drug/Gene/Photodynamic Therapy via a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dendritic&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Based Nanococktail for Treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI&#8208;Resistant Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI)&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli&#8208;responsive block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles for targeted co&#8208;delivery of gefitinib and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP)&#8208;siRNA. The nanosystem can block the EGFR signaling pathway with gefitinib, inhibit the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis by photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, a nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed by employing amphiphilic and block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell&#8208;line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent antitumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine can sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by downregulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanococktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes.

     alt="Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a time-consuming, laborious, and resource-intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data-driven approach that utilizes machine-learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme-like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme-like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme-like activity. Here, a data-driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine-learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme-like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme-like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;Doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions is designed by integrating Co&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles with highly crystalline poly(triazine imide), of which the surface Co&#8208;embedded CeCo conjunction features functionalized Co species toward the boosted directional electron&#8208;driving effect from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, thus promoting electronic transferability for multiple electrons&#8208;involving CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction.








Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involving reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction, is reported. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, this study identifies that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating the driving of electrons from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involving CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8211;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential toward targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

         <title>Biaxially Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of biaxial strain and layer numbers of MoS2 nanoshells on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated in detail. Calculations reveal the superiority of biaxial strain over uniaxial strain and identify the ideal Mo coordination and S vacancies for maximal catalytic activity.








Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial strain and the TMD layer number on the local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of a single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure are realized, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between the 1 and 5 layers. In particular, an electrode with the bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability testing. Density functional theory calculations reveal the contribution of the optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of 2D TMD electrocatalysts.

         <title>Active Ultrahigh&#8208;Q (0.2 &#215; 106) THz Topological Cavities on a Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106 is shown. On&#8208;chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter&#8208;/intrachip bandwidth density and energy&#8208;efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

On-chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high-speed and large-volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low-loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter-/intrachip bandwidth density and energy-efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low-loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh-quality (&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;) factor of 0.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. The topologically protected large &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; factor cavity enables energy-efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on-chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular design rules are established to overcome the trade&#8208;off between electronic and ionic conduction in OECTs. The gDPP&#8208;TTVTT copolymer achieves the best operational stability and maximum transconductance of 61.9 S cm&#8722;1. The long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer prevents morphological and electrostatic disruptions to the conjugated backbone, maintaining high electronic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, while increasing ion density for efficient and stable OECTs.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene&#8208;based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge&#8208;transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Visualizing Atomically Layered Magnetism in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a layered material possessing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at low temperatures (T&#160;&lt;&#160;132&#160;K). At higher temperatures or in the presence of modest magnetic fields, AFM correlations are suppressed, yielding a magnetic phase with a comparatively high sheet susceptibility (&#967;2D). Magnetic force microscopy is sensitive to &#967;2D and identifies local nanoscale magnetic ordering.








Abstract
2D materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8211;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8776;16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self-built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron-rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained under the electric field for ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with the dual self-built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the pure WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by modeling informed selection of the Mo&#8211;Au system, evolving grain boundary segregation behavior is explored through in situ electron microscopy thermal aging experiments on nanometallic multilayers. Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature&#8208;dependent stability transitions.








Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

         <title>Stable Zinc Anodes Enabled by a Zincophilic Polyanionic Hydrogel Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique polyanionic hydrogel is employed as an artificial protective layer for reversible Zn&#8208;metal anodes. The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc&#8208;ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of the Zn&#8208;metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO3&#8722; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti&#8208;catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV3O8&#183;1.5 H2O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn&#8208;anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.

         <title>A Vinylene&#8208;Linker&#8208;Based Polymer Acceptor Featuring a Coplanar and Rigid Molecular Conformation Enables High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vinylene&#8208;linker&#8208;based polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) with rigid and coplanar chain conformations is synthesized, exhibiting redshifted absorption and ordered packing. When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 17.1% than PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based ones and exhibit robust mechanical stability in flexible devices, suggesting the potential for commercial application.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY-V-&#947;-based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all-PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY-V-&#947;-based all-PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all-PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene-linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

         <title>A New Polystyrene&#8211;Poly(vinylpyridinium) Ionic Copolymer Dopant for n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Polymer Thermoelectrics with High and Stable Conductivity Relative to the Seebeck Coefficient giving High Power Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer dopant is designed and synthesized. It can dope n&#8208;type conjugated polymers to make n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer conducting materials and thermoelectrics, analogous to poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate). An electron conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1, mobility of 0.86 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved.








Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8211;poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;hexylpyridinium fluoride) (PSpF) with fluoride anions is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is thought to be the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF&#8208;doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88&#160;&#176;C and outstanding thermal stability are recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium) salt copolymers with fluoride anions are promising for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to the Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability, and broad processing window.

Cell Adhesion
In article number 2110340, Ramasamy Paulmurugan, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report template&#8208;mediated in situ tuning of nanoligand size and spacing. They demonstrate that submolecular ligand spacing and magnetic ligand anchoring facilitate adhesion&#8208;structure assembly&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;healing polarization of host macrophages. Increasing the ligand spacing significantly suppresses macrophage adhesion whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly inhibits it.

Ex&#8208;Solution Catalysts
In article number 2201109, WooChul Jung, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, and co&#8208;workers reconceptualize the ex&#8208;solution process with the design of a host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework as an oxide precursor. The critical challenges of ex&#8208;solution, which emerge through conventional synthesis methods, are addressed all at once through this strategy. The ex&#8208;solved nanoparticles promote oxygen chemisorption and function as primary active sites for acetone oxidation reactions in an example process, attaining record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.

Pixelated Soft Materials
In article number 2109682, P.&#8208;T. Brun and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a robust and predictive approach for the passive assembly of pixelated soft materials. They harness capillary suction in curable elastomers that self&#8208;assemble into complex tessellation patterns before they cure. The resulting pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized material properties.

Nanoporous Materials
In article number 2201502, David Fairen&#8208;Jimenez and co&#8208;workers conduct a round&#8208;robin exercise by providing 18 already&#8208;measured adsorption isotherms to sixty&#8208;one labs and show that the reproducibility of the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) area determination in micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials remains a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach&#8212;called BETSI&#8212;that expands on the Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible is developed.

Nanocrystalline Alloys
In article number 2200354, Jason Trelewicz and co&#8208;workers connect nanocrystalline stability regimes with temperature&#8208;dependent segregation states through in situ mapping of microstructural evolution in Mo&#8211;Au nanometallic multilayers combined with thermodynamic predictions of stable solute configurations. These findings provide a framework for decoupling thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the stability of nanocrystalline alloys exhibiting a transition from grain&#8208;boundary segregation to solute clustering and nanophase separation at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Recent Advances in Intelligent Wearable Medical Devices Integrating Biosensing and Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) are intensively investigated for personalized healthcare and smart therapy. Recent advances in wearable biosensing&#8722;delivery integrated therapeutic systems are summarized, with an emphasis on functional materials, responsiveness models, working mechanisms, and practices, to provide deep insights into the design, fabrication, and bioapplication of IWMDs.








Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug&#8208;delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances of SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the related interface optimization strategies and applications. The fundamental properties of SnO2 are discussed, with a focus on the defect chemistry, and various preparation methods for improving SnO2 and SnO2/perovskite interface. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for further development of SnO2&#8208;based PSCs are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the regular n&#8211;i&#8211;p device architecture have reached above 25% certified efficiency with continuously reported improvements in recent years. A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO2 as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this article, the key advances in SnO2 development are reviewed, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO2 for highly efficient and stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs. In addition, the general materials chemistry associated with SnO2 along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies are discussed, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics. Finally, some SnO2 implementations related to scalable processes and flexible devices are highlighted, and perspectives on the future development of efficient and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules are also provided.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality, often need time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, we show how crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. We developed aqueous ink formulations that, in the presence of polymeric latexes, enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy was generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulator, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables three&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several cm) in a robust and controlled way.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Obstructed Surface States as the Descriptor for Predicting Catalytic Active Sites in Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic obstructed surfaces states can be a descriptor for the fast and precise identification of catalytic active sites. High&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicted by simply counting the density of obstructed Wannier charge centers under the framework of classic d band theory.








Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real&#8208;space&#8208;invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes utilizing a Europium&#8208;Activated Calcium Oxide Phosphor with External Quantum Efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum efficiency of a CaO:Eu NIR phosphor is significantly improved and stabilized at high temperature. By utilizing GeO2 decomposition, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are effectively repaired. A record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR&#8208;emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology is innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach record photoelectric efficiency (100 mA@23.4%) and output power (100 mA&#8202;@&#8202;319.5 mW). This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LED light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium&#8208;Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;storage kinetics of a sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox&#8208;active MoC/Mo2C nanoparticles at the cathode. First&#8208;principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.








Abstract
This is the first report of molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single&#8208;Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase&#8208;Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are characterized using Raman, X&#8208;ray, and neutron scattering to quantify the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD). Combining single&#8208;particle and bulk analysis for static and dynamic systems enables a label&#8208;free dynamic monitoring of PLD activity in LNPs. This demonstrates that particle structure drives the interaction of lipid nanocarriers with PLD.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA) is combined with small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP&#8211;phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. This analysis demonstrates that PLD, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large&#8208;scale production of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potential in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of a simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy is reported for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8722;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which can also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Powering &#8776;50 &#181;m Motion by a Molecular Event in DNA Crystals</title>

A major challenge in material design is to translate molecular events to macroscale properties. In this work, self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals are shown to reversibly expand and contract over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli.








Abstract
A major challenge in material design is to couple nanoscale molecular and supramolecular events into desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Here, a novel self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal actuator is reported, which has reversible, directional expansion and contraction for over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and redox potential. The macroscopic actuation is powered by cooperative dissociation or cohesion of thousands of DNA sticky ends at the designed crystal contacts. The increase in crystal porosity and cavity in the expanded state dramatically enhances the crystal capability to accommodate/encapsulate nanoparticles/proteins, while the contraction enables a &#8220;sponge squeezing&#8221; motion for releasing nanoparticles. This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self&#8208;propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled&#8208;release systems.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the perovskite Sr0.9TiO3&#8722;&#948;, the perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.7Mn0.3O3&#8722;&#948; (STMn0.3) with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits superior adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of lithium polysulfides, and improves the utilization of sulfur. The STMn0.3 battery still delivers a superior initial specific capacity of 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle after 1500&#160;cycles at 2 C, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency lithium&#8211;sulfur battery.








Abstract
Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li&#8211;S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1&#8722;xMnxO3&#8722;&#948; (STMnx) (x&#160;=&#160;0.1&#8211;0.3) with different oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentration and adsorptive&#8208;catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li&#8211;S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in&#160;situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3&#160;with high oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8211;S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Native Ligand Carbonization Renders Common Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Durable for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction: Annealing Temperature Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native surface ligands (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) attached to Pt nanoparticles during synthesis can be directly converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells upon thermal annealing, rendering common Pt particles highly stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This in situ ligand carbonization strategy is general and can also be applied to improve the stability of commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Using Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20 000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Coupling Localized Laser Writing and Nonlocal Recrystallization in Perovskite Crystals for Reversible Multidimensional Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing multifield modulation of coupled localized laser writing and nonlocal moisture treatment on metal halide perovskites crystals enables the creation and manipulation of localized photoluminescence for optical encryption from 2D to 3D and 4D, such as reversible encryption&#8211;reading, repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing, and even spatially and temporally resolved reading with high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution has been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in nonluminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. Further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as revealed by density functional theory simulations, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of moisture&#8208;induced CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8211;reading and repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to 3D and 4D by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multifield modulation on perovskite crystals can enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing.

Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light&#8208;irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

     alt="Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2-bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid-to-liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real-time self-healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 14.14% (CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br), and 23.37% (FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in-service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non-radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all-inorganic CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions between Layered Indium Selenide for Integrated Photonic Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition between two topologically similar layered structures in In2Se3 breaks the speed and energy limitations of photonic memory, via reversible nonvolatile refractive index change induced by a single nanosecond pulse. In this work, the atomistic phase&#8208;change pathway between the layered structures is unraveled with in situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and integrated photonic switching with a transferred epitaxial layer is demonstrated. Detailed analysis on the volumetric effect and by nonlinear spectroscopy are provided to harness the mode coupling and loss in the hybrid device.








Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states. The slow or energy&#8208;hungry amorphous&#8211;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the scalability and performance of devices. Leveraging an integrated photonic platform, nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3) triggered by a single nanosecond pulse is demonstrated. The high&#8208;resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With interlayer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, switching between the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contains low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8211;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular&#8208;beam&#8208;epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab initio calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure of incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz, introduced by a 1.5&#160;&#181;m&#8208;long In2Se3&#8208;covered layer, resulted from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands, and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic substrate modulation perturbs the electronic states of graphene, duplicates Dirac cones, and effectively couples the two valleys of the Dirac states in epitaxial monolayer graphene. The intervalley interaction is controlled by the substrate lattice constant. Moir&#233; flat bands emerge at certain magic values of the substrate lattice constant.








Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the 2D material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals, and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates is proposed. Graphene/SiC heterostructure is taken as a prototypical example and it is demonstrated experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and, consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of the Dirac states and indicates that moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3)R30o\[(\sqrt 3 \; \times \;\sqrt 3 )R{30^o}\] supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.&#160;

         <title>Van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) method to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of effective piezoelectric domains is presented. The vdWE method facilitates the detection of piezoelectricity and make the application of piezoelectric biological tissues possible. The vdWE&#8208;processed SIS (small intestinal submucosa) ultrathin film reaches the thickness of 100 nm and exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process is reported to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, the piezoelectric property is revealed of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8722;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of &#8776;250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain modulation strategy to constrain phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber by reinforcing the energy barrier for ion migration is reported. With compressive strain, the single&#8208;junction devices yield one of smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top&#8208;cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light&#8208;stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single&#8208;junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open-circuit.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide-bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top-cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light-stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide-bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light-induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide-bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single-junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open-circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>Identification of the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of Pt sites, Ptzn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 and Ptads&#8208;S2 are identified on Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.








Abstract
For single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8722; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but leaves more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle.&#8221;

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

         <title>Stable Universal 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Input Single&#8208;Molecule Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule logic devices are ideal candidates for ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements to perform high&#8208;density computing. Gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au single&#8208;electron transistors not only hold the advantage of controlling molecular orbitals (MOs) via bias and gate voltages, but also exhibit a unique electronic structure with two adjacent MOs. This provides a single&#8208;electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.








Abstract
Controllable single&#8208;molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements for high&#8208;density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single&#8208;electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single&#8208;electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real&#8208;time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (Vb) and gate (Vg) voltages. Reliable and low&#8208;voltage (&#448;Vb&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;Vg&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron&#8208;transport calculations. Stable multi&#8208;logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1&#8208;input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2&#8208;input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.

This provides a single-electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single-molecule device.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllable single-molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra-minimalistic circuit elements for high-density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Fc-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single-electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single-electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real-time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) and gate (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) voltages. Reliable and low-voltage (&#448;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron-transport calculations. Stable multi-logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1-input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2-input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High&#8208;Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high&#8208;entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag&#8208;decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. This work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabrication of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) with only 25&#160;mol% bromide are enabled by steric engineering via alloying dimethylammonium and chloride. The WBG single&#8208;junction cells, with a high efficiency of 17.7%, exhibit promising operational stability under 1&#8208;sun illumination (T90 of 1045 h). This strategy enables all&#8208;perovskite tandem with an impressive stabilized efficiency of 26.0%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG, &#8776;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is a crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here, a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable WBG perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems is reported. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The WBG PSCs exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskites enabled by steric engineering, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is further obtained. The strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable WBG subcells for multijunction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Multitasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitasking, flexible sensor sheet for monitoring of weather information via a flexible resistive sensor and reservoir computing is reported. This sensor and reservoir computing combination enables the device to estimate water droplet volume and wind velocity with a small training dataset. An important advance is to realize multiple parameter detection simultaneously using only one flexible sensor.








Abstract
Natural disasters are reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multitasking sensors located on nonplanar surfaces, a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity is devised. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time&#8208;series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221; to extract the volume and velocity from a single sensor as multitasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind&#8208;change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multitasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <title>Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenide &#8220;TMCC:&#8221; A New Family of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) can be considered an atomic&#8208;level combination of TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Realized by electrochemical&#8208;assisted delamination, Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C are the first examples of TMCCs to be delaminated into single layers. These newly developed 2D TMCCs are 50% stronger than TMDC counterparts and have a wide range of applications.








Abstract
Here, a new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

&lt;p&gt;Here, a new family of 2D transition metal carbo-chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well-known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C and Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid-state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C. The delaminated Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C outperforms both multilayered Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C and delaminated NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an electrode material for Li-ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing using Memristor Arrays with Ultrathin 2D PdSeOx/PdSe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure is demonstrated using controllable ultraviolet&#8211;ozone treatment. By confining the formation of conductive filaments in the heterostructure, the memristor achieves a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image&#8208;recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.








Abstract
In&#8208;memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide&#8208;based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni&#8208;based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in energy conversion.

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;Accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as the matrix for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the acquisition of serum metabolic fingerprints. Fe&#8208;MOF&#8208;UL with favorable charge transfer and mitigated thermal dissipation achieves &#8776;10&#160;000&#8208;fold signal enhancement and leads to high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis of three major cancers, promising a universal detection tool for human cancers.








Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life; therefore, a high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffering of cancers. While biopsies and imaging methods are widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, a new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expected due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effectiveness with high body tolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, allowing favorable charge transfer within the molecule&#8211;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes, are developed. Consequently, a surprising signal enhancement of &#8776;10 000&#8208;fold is achieved, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve of 0.908&#8211;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8211;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record&#8208;high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability compared to the host system.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the nonradiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl is designed and incorporated into a PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectrum, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the nonradiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Progress and Future Prospects of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Metal&#8208;Compound&#8208;Based Passivating Contacts for Silicon Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the increasing interest in searching for high&#8208;quality low&#8208;cost passivating contacts for c&#8208;Si solar cells, the fundamentals and development status of wide&#8208;bandgap metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions in developing highly transparent passivating contacts with excellent carrier selectivity are discussed. Based on in&#8208;depth data analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies for metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts design and device integration are pointed out.








Abstract
Advanced doped&#8208;silicon&#8208;layer&#8208;based passivating contacts have boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells to over 26%. However, the inevitable parasitic light absorption of the doped silicon layers impedes further PCE improvement. To this end, alternative passivating contacts based on wide&#8208;bandgap metal compounds (so&#8208;called dopant&#8208;free passivating contacts (DFPCs)) have attracted great attention, thanks to their potential merits in terms of parasitic absorption loss, ease&#8208;of&#8208;deposition, and cost. Intensive research activity has surrounded this topic with significant progress made in recent years. Various electron&#8208;selective and hole&#8208;selective contacts based on metal compounds have been successfully developed, and a champion PCE of 23.5% has been achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell with a MoOx&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective contact. In this work, the fundamentals and development status of DFPCs are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions for enhancing the carrier selectivity of DFPCs are discussed. Based on comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies and future prospects for DFPCs design and device implementation are pointed out. By tuning the carrier concentration of the metal compound and the work function of the capping transparent electrode, high PCEs over 26% can be achieved for c&#8208;Si solar cells with DFPCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing stable aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit throughout the entire alloy composition range. Furthermore, an experimental and theoretical atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor (single&#8208;layer NbSe2) with structural disorder is reported.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8722;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948;&#160;&lt; 1) is investigated using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2) is studied. The measurements enable extraction of the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder and further shown that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. Mo doping is shown to decrease the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. These results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

Flexible Sensors
In article number 2201663, Kohei Nakajima, Kuniharu Takei, and co&#8208;workers propose a multitasking flexible sensor realized by using reservoir computing analysis to estimate rain&#8208;droplet volume and wind flow for future weathercasting. Surface morphology and conditions of the sensor are investigated to detect continuous water&#8208;droplet conductivity precisely, and an optimized reservoir computing algorithm is applied for water&#8208;volume and wind&#8208;flow estimations using a single sensor.

Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
In article number 2200492, Miguel M. Ugeda and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the feasibility of synthesis and stability of aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit and report the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and behavior of the collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor with structural disorder.

Catalytic Active Sites
In article number 2201328, Guowei Li, B. Andrei Bernevig, Claudia Felser, and co&#8208;workers propose a descriptor to predicate the position of catalytic active sites fast and precisely. By a simple checking of the space group and the position of obstructed surface states for the given obstructed insulators, high&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicated.

Spinodal Architected Materials
In article number 2109304, Glaucio H. Paulino and co&#8208;workers report spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy to unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. Mechanical anisotropy and porosity are spatially tailored to directly target mechanical function (e.g., stiffness) and indirectly promote biological function (e.g., fluid transport conduits). Applications to medical (e.g., prosthetics) and mechanical components are demonstrated.

Single&#8208;Molecule Devices
In article number 2202135, Zong&#8208;Liang Li, Christian A. Nijhuis, Enrique Del Barco, and co&#8208;workers report a single&#8208;electron logic calculator formed by a gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au transistor. The unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals in the Fc moiety are controlled by the orthogonal bias and gate voltages, resulting in the implementation of all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of engineering, biology, and materials science is providing unprecedented opportunities to integrate living microbes into hydrogel matrices. This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self&#8208;replication, self&#8208;adaption, and environmental responsiveness.








Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells are described, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviors and how cells affect hydrogel properties. The interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications, are also discussed. Finally, current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings are highlighted.

         <title>Thermoplasmonics in Solar Energy Conversion: Materials, Nanostructured Designs, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments of thermoplasmonics in the solar energy field. The physics fundamentals behind thermoplasmonics are elaborated, basic strategies of material and nanostructured designs toward more efficient photothermal conversion are summarized. Then, recent advances are reviewed for targeted applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaics. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. Here, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the wide variety of electromechanical responses of liquid metal stretchable electronics reported in the literature are reviewed. Complementing this review with&#160;our&#160;own measurements, the relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that of a bulk conductor. Then, possible explanations for the discrepancies are dicussed and suggestions are provided on experimental design for future research.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature is reviewed and pure EGaIn is investigated using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. The results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, possible explanations for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are provided on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable research.
