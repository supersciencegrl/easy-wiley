         <title>Multidimensional Interactive Cascading Nanochips for Detection of Multiple Liver Diseases via Precise Metabolite Profiling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It is challenging to detect and differentiate multiple diseases with high complexity/similarity from the same organ. Metabolic analysis based on nanomatrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NMALDI&#8208;MS) is a promising platform for disease diagnosis, while the enhanced property of its core nanomatrix materials has plenty room for improvement. Herein, a multidimensional interactive cascade nanochip composed of iron oxide nanoparticles/MXene/gold nanoparticles, IMG, is reported for serum metabolic profiling to achieve high&#8208;throughput detection of multiple liver diseases. MXene serves as a multi&#8208;binding site and an electron&#8208;hole source for ionization during NMALDI&#8208;MS analysis. Introduction of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with surface plasmon resonance properties facilitate surface charge accumulation and rapid energy conversion. Iron oxide nanoparticles are integrated into the MXene/Au nanocomposite to sharply reduce the thermal conductivity of the nanochip with negligible heat loss for strong thermally&#8208;driven desorption, and construct a multi&#8208;interaction proton transport pathway with MXene and AuNPs for strong ionization. Analysis of these enhanced serum fingerprint signals detected from the IMG nanochip through a neural network model results in differentiation of multiple liver diseases via a single pass and revelation of potential metabolic biomarkers. The promising method could rapidly, accurately screen various liver diseases, thus allowing timely treatment of liver diseases.

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Mechanoluminescence from 0D Hybrid Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions are achieved in 0D chiral Mn&#8208;based hybrid manganese halides with large conjugate ligands. These compounds exhibit highly bright and sensitive green CPML emissions with an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect, and then are demonstrated as chiral stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in multilevel confidential information encryption.








Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have application prospects in many fields, due to their abundant host&#8211;guest structures and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). However, CPLs in HMHs are predominantly excited by light or electricity, limiting their use in multivariate environments. It is necessary to explore a novel excitation method to extend the application of chiral HMHs as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive optical materials. In this work, an enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid manganese bromides, [H2(2R,4R)&#8208;(+)/(2S,4S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;2,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane]MnBr4 [(R/S)&#8208;1] is presented, which exhibits efficient CPL emissions with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and high dissymmetry factors of &#177; 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Notably, (R/S)&#8208;1 compounds exhibit unprecedented and bright circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions under mechanical stimulation. Moreover, (R/S)&#8208;1 possess high mechanical force sensitivities with mechanoluminescence (ML) emissions detectable under 0.1 N force stimulation. Furthermore, this ML emission exhibits an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect in the temperature range of 300&#8211;380 K, which is revealed to originate from a thermal activation energy compensation mechanism from trap levels to Mn(II) 4T1 level. Based on their intriguing optical properties, these compounds as chiral force&#8208;responsive materials are demonstrated in multilevel confidential information encryption.

         <title>Deshielding Anions Enable Solvation Chemistry Control of LiPF6&#8208;Based Electrolyte toward Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dilemma of solvation chemistry control for Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes is tackled by introducing deshielding anions. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NO3&#8722; is chosen. Graphite anodes exhibit enhanced capacity retention of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C than the counterpart electrolyte (32.3%). This strategybypasses the solubility limitation of commonly used LiPF6 and enable its application under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Severe capacity decay under subzero temperatures remains a significant challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the sluggish interfacial kinetics. Current efforts to mitigate this deteriorating interfacial behavior rely on high&#8208;solubility lithium salts (e.g., Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI))&#8208;based electrolytes to construct anion participated solvation structures. However, such electrolytes bring issues of corrosion on the current collector and increased costs. Herein, the most commonly used Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) instead, to establish a peculiar solvation structure with a high ratio of ion pairs and aggregates by introducing a deshielding NO3&#8722; additive for low&#8208;temperature LIBs is utilized. The deshielding anion significantly reduces the energy barrier for interfacial behavior at low temperatures. Benefiting from this, the graphite (Gr) anode retains a high capacity of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which is far superior to the 32.3% and 19.4% capacity retention of counterpart electrolytes. Moreover, the LiCoO2/Gr full cell exhibits a stable cycling performance of 100 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C due to the inhibited lithium plating. This work heralds a new paradigm in LiPF6&#8208;based electrolyte design for LIBs operating at subzero temperatures.

         <title>A Novel N&#8208;Type Molecular Dopant With a Closed&#8208;Shell Electronic Structure Applicable to the Vacuum&#8208;Deposition Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;type materials are known to lag behind p&#8208;type materials in the organic electronics field, which is not only for semiconducting materials but also for n&#8208;type dopants, the status quo of which is not quite satisfactory. Here, a novel n&#8208;type molecular dopant applicable to the vacuum&#8208;deposition process is reported, as well as its applications to organic thermoelectric materials and field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a new efficient versatile n&#8208;type dopant with a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure are described. By employing the tetraphenyl&#8211;dipyranylidene (DP0) framework with two 7&#960;&#8208;electron systems modified with N,N&#8208;dimethylamino groups as the strong electron&#8208;donating substituent, 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis[4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyranylidene (DP7), a closed&#8208;shell molecule with an extremely high&#8208;lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital, close to 4.0&#160;eV below the vacuum level, is successfully developed. Thanks to its thermal stability, DP7 is applicable to vacuum deposition, which allows utilization of DP7 in bulk doping for the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials and contact doping for reducing contact resistance in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors. As vacuum&#8208;deposition processable n&#8208;type dopants are very limited, DP7 stands out as a useful n&#8208;type dopant, particularly for the latter purpose.

         <title>Robust, Sprayable, and Multifunctional Hydrogel Coating through a Polycation Reinforced (PCR) Surface Bridging Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging method is developed to achieve robust and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations provide superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, leading to ultra&#8208;tough adhesion (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2), remarkable fatigue resistance, and facile construction. This PCR technique offers novel insight for the development of hydrogel hybrid devices.








Abstract
The sprayable hydrogel coatings that can establish robust adhesion onto diverse materials and devices hold enormous potential; however, a significant challenge persists due to monomer hydration, which impedes even coverage during spraying and induces inadequate adhesion post&#8208;gelation. Herein, a polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging strategy is presented to achieve tough and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations offer superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, facilitating an effective spraying application. This PCR&#8208;based hydrogel coatings demonstrate tough adhesion performance to inert PTFE and silicone, including remarkable shear strength (161&#160;&#177;&#160;49&#160;kPa for PTFE), interfacial toughness (198&#160;&#177;&#160;27&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for PTFE), and notable tolerance to cyclic tension (10&#160;000 cycles, 200% strain, silicone). Meanwhile, this method can be applied to various hydrogel formulations, offering diverse functionalities, including underwater adhesion, lubrication, and drug delivery. Furthermore, the PCR concept enables the conformal construction of durable hydrogel coatings onto sophisticated medical devices like cardiovascular stents. Given its simplicity and adaptability, this approach paves an avenue for incorporating hydrogels onto solid surfaces and potentially promotes untapped applications.

         <title>220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz Compatible Bipolar Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright bipolar quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with the external quantum efficiency exceeding 22% are developed by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al/Ag bridging layer. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting device can be driven directly by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics.








Abstract
Alternating current (AC)&#8208;driven quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are superior to direct current&#8208;driven QLEDs because they can be directly integrated into household AC electricity and have high stability. However, achieving high&#8208;performance AC&#8208;driven QLEDs remains challenging. In this work, a bipolar QLED with coplanar electrodes is realized by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al bridging layer. The bipolar QLED can be turned on with either a positive or a negative bias voltage, with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.9%. By replacing the Al with Ag, the resistances of the electron transport layers are effectively reduced, and thus the bipolar QLED shows an enhanced brightness of 16370&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 15&#160;V. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting light source can be directly driven by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics. The bipolar QLED can also be realized by vertically stacking a regular QLED and an inverted QLED with a metallic intermediate connection layer. It is demonstrated that the coplanar or vertical bipolar QLEDs could find potential applications in household AC electricity play&#8208;and&#8208;plug solid&#8208;state lighting and single&#8208; or double&#8208;sided displays.

         <title>Recyclable Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials with Superior Latent Heat via Reversible Anhydride&#8208;Alcohol Crosslinking for Efficient Thermal Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials with superior thermal energy storage capacity and dual recyclability are developed here by reacting anhydride copolymers with polyethylene glycol. Novel combined grafted and crosslinked crystalline structure promises a peak latent heat up to 156.8 J g&#8722;1; reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks enable outstanding recyclability. The potential of efficient solar energy conversion/storage/release has also been explored.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) with crosslinked polymer structures have received sustained interest due to their remarkable shape stability, enabling their application independently without the need for encapsulation or supporting materials. However, the crosslinking structure also compromises their latent heat and poses challenges to their recyclability. Herein, a novel strategy harnessing the internal&#8208;catalyzed reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinking reaction to fabricate SSPCMs with superior latent heat and exceptional dual recyclability is presented. Easily accessible anhydride copolymers (e.g., propylene&#8208;maleic anhydride alternating copolymers), provide abundant reactive anhydride sites within the polymer matrix; polyethylene glycol serves as both the grafted phase change component and the crosslinker. The resulting SSPCMs attain a peak latent heat value of 156.8 J g&#8722;1 which surpasses all other reported recyclable crosslinked SSPCMs. The materials also exhibit certain flexibility and a tunable tensile strength ranging from 6.6 to 11.0 MPa. Beyond that, leveraging the reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks, the SSPCMs demonstrate dual recyclability through bond&#8208;exchange remolding and reversible&#8208;dissociation&#8208;enabled dissolving&#8208;recrosslinking without any reactive chemicals. Furthermore, by integrating solar&#8208;thermal conversion fillers like polydopamine nanoparticles, the potential of the system in efficient conversion, storage, and release of solar energy is highlighted.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation in ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Water&#8208;Splitting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re1&#8722;xVxSe2 alloy nanosheets consisted of atomic structures that boost synergically the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction over a wide composition range.








Abstract
It is challenging to control the electronic structure of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) for extended applications in renewable energy devices. Here, ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 (Re1&#8722;xVxSe2) alloy nanosheets over the whole composition range via a colloidal reaction is synthesized. Increasing x makes the nanosheets more metallic and induces a 1T&#8243;&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition at x = 0.5&#8211;0.6. Compared to the MoSe2&#8208;VSe2 and WSe2&#8208;VSe2 alloy nanosheets, ReSe2 and VSe2 are mixed more homogeneously at the atomic scale. The alloy nanosheets at x = 0.1&#8211;0.7 exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that alloying caused the Re and V atoms to be synergically more active in the HER. Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) and density of state calculations confirm that alloying and Se vacancies effectively activate the metal sites toward HER. The composition dependence of HER performance is explained by homogenous atomic mixing with the increased Se vacancies. The study provides a strategy for designing new TMD alloy nanosheets with enhanced catalytic activity.

         <title>A Photolithographable Electrolyte for Deeply Rechargeable Zn Microbatteries in On&#8208;Chip Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caffeine is introduced to ZnSO4 solution, forming a photolithographable electrolyte with an ultraviolet light curable polymer. Zn&#8208;rich interphase is built up over cycling, and stabilizes the Zn anode and hence reversibility of both half and full cells over a broad dimension from several centimeters down to hundreds of micrometers.








Abstract
Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV&#8208;crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn2+ ions forms a Zn2+&#8208;conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO3 and 2ZnCO3&#183;3Zn(OH)2 over cycling. The resulting Zn&#8208;rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on&#8208;chip microbatteries, the resulting solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO2 full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss&#8208;roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm2. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on&#8208;chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.

&lt;p&gt;Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions forms a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 2ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;3Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over cycling. The resulting Zn-rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on-chip microbatteries, the resulting solid-electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss-roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on-chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries has been hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. Since grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes like Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants, here we have proposed a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure was obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores was fine&#8208;tuned through changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allowed, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density was increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 gradually up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects was confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. Our study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Nanofluid&#8208;Guided Janus Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Harvesting electricity from widespread water evaporation provides an alternative route to cleaner power generation technology. However, current evaporation power generation (EPG) mainly depends on the dissociation process of certain functional groups (e.g., SO3H) in water, which suffers from low power density and short&#8208;term output. Herein, we prepare the Janus membrane combining nanofluid and water&#8208;grabbing material for EPG, where the nanoconfined ionic liquids (NCILs) serve as ion sources instead of the functional groups. Benefiting from the selective and fast transport of anions in NCILs, such EPG demonstrates excellent power performance with a voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#956;A, and maximum power density of 16.55 &#956;W cm&#8722;2 while operating for at least 180 hours consistently. Molecular dynamics simulation and surface potential analysis reveal the molecular mechanism, that is the diffusion of Cl&#8722; anions during evaporation is much faster than that of cations, generating the voltage and current across the membrane. Furthermore, the device performs well in varying environmental conditions, including different water temperatures and sources of evaporating water, showcasing its adaptability and integrability. Overall, the nanofluid&#8208;guided Janus membrane can efficiently transform low&#8208;grade thermal energy in evaporation into electricity, showing a competitive advantage over other sustainable applied approaches.

         <title>Gold Recovery from E&#8208;Waste by Food&#8208;waste Amyloid Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The demand for gold recovery from E&#8208;waste has grown steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource&#8208;intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side&#8208;stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from E&#8208;waste. To do so, AF aerogels were prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in E&#8208;waste. The results demonstrate that the AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg/g) and selectivity, making it an efficient and adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from E&#8208;waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high&#8208;purity gold nuggets, constituted by approximately 90.8&#160;wt.% gold (21&#8208;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8208;economic analysis of the process finally consolidated the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side&#8208;streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from E&#8208;waste.

         <title>Inhibition of Vanadium Cathodes Dissolution in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathode dissolution significantly limits the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, particularly at low currents. An artificial constructed on V6O13 cathodes (ZnOTf&#8208;LDH) is revealed to repel water, impede vanadium shuttling, and facilitate zinc transport. This suppresses vanadium dissolution and enables stable cycling for over 200 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1. The method is applicable to different vanadium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have experienced a rapid surge in popularity, as evident from the extensive research with over 30 000 articles published in the past 5 years. Previous studies on AZIBs have showcased impressive long&#8208;cycle stability at high current densities, achieving thousands or tens of thousands of cycles. However, the practical stability of AZIBs at low current densities (&lt;1C) is restricted to merely 50&#8211;100 cycles due to intensified cathode dissolution. This genuine limitation poses a considerable challenge to their transition from the laboratory to the industry. In this study, leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an artificial interphase that achieves both hydrophobicity and restriction of the outward penetration of dissolved vanadium cations, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium and suppressing the vanadium dissolution following Le Chatelier's principle, is described. The approach has resulted in one of the best cycling stabilities to date, with no noticeable capacity fading after more than 200 cycles (&#8776;720&#160;h) at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.47C). These findings represent a significant advance in the design of ultrastable cathodes for aqueous batteries and accelerate the industrialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bridging the Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis by Supramolecular Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Varied Packing Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of {Cu12} based tetrahedral (Td) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with varied packing modes are self&#8208;assembled, which act as highly active homogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. The varied packing of Td cages from hexagonal to cubic mode in the MOC enables one&#8208;step heterogenous separation of the catalyst, co&#8208;catalyst, and product, which perfectly bridges the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Integrating the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has proved to be an optimal strategy for developing catalytic systems with high efficiency, selectivity, and recoverability. Supramolecular metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), assembled by the coordination of metal ions with organic linkers into discrete molecules, have performed solvent processability due to their tunable packing modes, endowing them with the potential to act as homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in different solvent systems. Here, the design and synthesis of a series of stable {Cu3} cluster&#8208;based tetrahedral MOCs with varied packing structures are reported. These MOCs, as homogeneous catalysts, not only show high catalytic activity and selectivity regardless of substrate size during the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, but also can be easily recovered from the reaction media through separating products and co&#8208;catalysts by one&#8208;step work&#8208;up. This is because that these MOCs have varied solubilities in different solvents due to the tunable packing of MOCs in the solid state. Moreover, the entire catalytic reaction system is very clean, and the purity of cyclic carbonates is as high as 97% without further purification. This work provides a unique strategy for developing novel supramolecular catalysts that can be used for homogeneous catalysis and recycled in a heterogeneous manner.

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Immune Cells Using Synthetic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of in vivo cell reprogramming platforms for in situ cell therapy. Following infusion into the patients, the nanoparticles directly transfer the transgene cargos (plasmid DNA, mRNA, etc.) into the cell of interest (T lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.) and transiently program the targeted cells to express transgenes inside the body.








Abstract
In the past decade, adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the complexity and high costs involved in manufacturing current adoptive cell therapy greatly inhibit its widespread availability and access. To address this, in situ cell therapy, which directly reprograms immune cells inside the body, has recently been developed as a promising alternative. Here, an overview of the recent progress in the development of synthetic nanomaterials is provided to deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA for in situ reprogramming of T cells and macrophages, focusing especially on in situ CAR therapies. Also, the main challenges for in situ immune cell reprogramming are discussed and some approaches to overcome these barriers to fulfill the clinical applications are proposed.

         <title>A Hybrid Nanoadjuvant Simultaneously Depresses PD&#8208;L1/TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and Activates cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Overcome Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Resistance</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation and activing the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to reverse tumor hypoxia and impair DNA damage repair. This Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb system effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects.








Abstract
Currently, certain cancer patients exhibit resistance to radiotherapy due to reduced DNA damage under hypoxic conditions and acquired immune tolerance triggered by transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) and membrane&#8208;localized programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1). Meanwhile, cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 induces radiotherapy resistance through accelerating DNA damage repair (DDR). However, the disability of clinically used PD&#8208;L1 antibodies in inhibiting cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 limits their effectiveness. Therefore, a nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer to radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation through depressing PD&#8208;L1 and TGF&#8208;&#946;1 by triphenylphosphine&#8208;derived metformin, and activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by generating Mn2+ from MnO2 and producing more dsDNA via reversing tumor hypoxia and impairing DDR. Thus, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects. Overall, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb has the potential to be clinically applied for overcoming radio&#8208;immunotherapy resistance.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Ionic Conductors with Tunable Resistance Switching Temperature Enabled by Phase Transformation of Polymer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) with tunable resistance switching temperature are designed by polymer cocrystal phase. These obtained PTICs have ultrahigh temperature sensitivity in the resistance switching region and can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) show significant prospects for functional applications due to their reversible resistance switching property. However, the representative design principle of PTICs is utilizing the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of ionic liquids, and the resistance switching temperatures of such PTICs cannot be tuned as desired. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to design PTICs with on&#8208;demand resistance switching temperatures by using the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of polymer cocrystal phase, whose melting temperature shows a linear relationship with the polymer compositions. Owing to the melt of polymer cocrystal domains and the tunable migration of ions in the resistance switching region, the obtained PTICs display ultrahigh temperature sensitivity with a superior temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;8.50% &#176;C&#8722;1 around human body temperature, as compared to various ionic conductors previously reported. Therefore, the PTICs can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation. It is believed that this work may inspire future researches on the development of advanced soft electrical devices.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Thermal Insulation and Impact Resistance in Transparent Bulk Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transparent bulk glass is utilized for light transmission and protection against external hazards, but it is hindered by poor protective properties. Through synergistic effects between nacre&#8208;inspired structures and shear&#8208;stiffening materials, the fabricated glass composite (NSG) demonstrates optimal impact resistance over a wide range of impact velocities. Moreover, NSG exhibits superior light transmittance, thermal insulation, and other comprehensive application properties.








Abstract
Transparent bulk glass is highly demanded in devices and components of daily life to transmit light and protect against external temperature and mechanical hazards. However, the application of glass is impeded by its poor functional performance, especially in terms of thermal isolation and impact resistance. Here, a glass composite integrating the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and shear stiffening gel (SSG) material is proposed. Benefiting from the combination of these two elements, this nacre&#8208;inspired SSG/glass composite (NSG) exhibits superior thermal insulation and impact resistance while maintaining transparency simultaneously. Specifically, the low thermal conductivity of the SSG combined with the anisotropic heat transfer capability of the nacre&#8208;inspired structure enhances the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal insulation of NSG. The deformations over large volumes in nacre&#8208;inspired facesheets promote the deformation region of the SSG core, synergistic effect of tablet sliding mechanism in nacre&#8208;inspired structure and strain&#8208;rate enhancement in SSG material cause the superior impact resistance of overall panels in a wide range of impact velocities. NSG demonstrates outstanding properties such as transparency, light weight, impact resistance, and thermal insulation, which are major concerns for the application in engineering fields. In conclusion, this bioinspired SSG/glass composite opens new avenues to achieve comprehensive performance improvements for transparent structural materials.

         <title>Interior&#8208;Confined Vacancy in Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for Ultra&#8208;Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface repair strategy is proposed to reduce the content of Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF). KMHCF with 2% VFeCN is obtained at 90 &#176;C, and VFeCN is mainly concentrated in the lattice interior. The eliminated surface VFeCN can inhibit the Mn2+ dissolution into the electrolyte, resulting in excellent cycling performance in potassium ion batteries.








Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are viewed as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities and redox potentials. However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, we propose a repair method that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF&#8208;H). The KMHCF&#8208;H obtained at 90 &#176;C contains only 2% VFeCN, and the VFeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe&#8211;CN&#8211;Mn surface structure of the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode with repaired surface VFeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half&#8208;cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles) and full&#8208;cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). This thermal repair method enables scalable preparation of KMHCF with a low content of vacancies, holding substantial promise for practical applications of PIBs.

         <title>Polymer Donor with a Simple Skeleton and Minor Siloxane Decoration Enables 19% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized. The polymer with a simple skeleton enables organic solar cells with over 19% efficiency and supplies active layers with processing endurance in high humidity air.








Abstract
Development of polymer donors with simple chemical structure and low cost is of great importance for commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a simply 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized in comparison with its alternating copolymer PTQ11. Relative to molecular weight (Mn) of 28.3&#160;kg mol&#8722;1 for PTQ11, the random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with minor siloxane decoration is beneficial for achieving higher Mn up to 51.1&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. In addition, PMQ&#8208;Si605 can show stronger aggregation ability and faster charge mobility as well as more efficient exciton dissociation in active layer as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. With L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F as acceptor, its PMQ&#8208;Si605 based OSCs display power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.08%, much higher than 16.21% for PTQ11 based devices. With another acceptor BTP&#8208;H2 to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PMQ&#8208;Si605, further elevated PCEs of 18.50% and 19.15% can be achieved with the binary and ternary OSCs, respectively. Furthermore, PMQ&#8208;Si605 based active layers are suitable for processing in high humidity air, an important factor for massive production of OSCs. Therefore, the siloxane decoration on polymer donors is promising, affording PMQ&#8208;Si605 as a high&#8208;performing and low cost candidate.

         <title>Toward the Commercialization of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first introduces the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications. Then it identifies critical challenges in commercialization and corresponding solutions, including strategies for power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement over large areas, stability improvements, toxicity reduction, and so on. Finally, it includes some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future.








Abstract
Perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) devices are undergoing rapid development and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% at the cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light&#8208;related stability. Moreover, the solution&#8208;process nature makes the fabrication process of perovskite photovoltaic devices feasible and compatible with some mature high&#8208;volume manufacturing techniques. All these features render perovskite solar modules (PSMs) suitable for terawatt&#8208;scale energy production with a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In this review, the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications are first introduced. Then critical challenges are identified in their commercialization and propose the corresponding solutions, including developing strategies to realize high&#8208;quality films over a large area to further improve power conversion efficiency and stability to meet the commercial demands. Finally, some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future, mainly focusing on further dealing with toxicity and recycling of the whole device, and the attainment of highly efficient perovskite&#8208;based tandem modules, which can reduce the environmental impact and accelerate the LCOE reduction are put forwarded.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Memtransistors with Magnetized Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic CrI3 is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer, which achieves reliable memtransistor operations based on the electrical control of the magnetic proximity effect.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized bands in pristine and proximity&#8208;induced magnetic materials are promising building blocks for future devices. Conceptually new memory, logic, and neuromorphic devices are conceived based on atomically thin magnetic materials and the manipulation of their spin&#8208;polarized bands via electrical and optical methods. A critical remaining issue is the direct probe and the optimized use of the magnetic coupling effect in van der Waals heterostructures, which requires further delicate design of atomically thin magnetic materials and devices. Here, a spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic material, CrI3, is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer. The microscopic working principle is clarified by the first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis of the transport data. Reliable memtransistor operations (i.e., memory and logic device&#8208;combined operations), as well as a spin&#8208;selective probe of Landau levels in the magnetized graphene, are achieved by using the subtle manipulation of the magnetic proximity effect via electrical means.

         <title>Synergy of Pd2+/S2&#8722;&#8208;Doped TiO2 Supported on 2&#8208;Methylimidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Polypyrrole/Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Nitrogen Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd2+&#8208; and S2&#8722;&#8208;doped TiO2 immobilized on 2&#8208;methylimidazolium functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide (2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO) exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward nitrogen oxidation reaction due to the synergistic effect of each component. Especially, the sulfate radicals in situ formed on Pb/S&#8211;TiO2@2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO further promote nitrogen adsorption and decrease the reaction energy barrier, resulting in the acceleration of nitrogen oxidation reaction.








Abstract

         <title>Resistive Memory Devices at the Thinnest Limit: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2D monolayer materials as dielectric or channel layers, resistive memory technology can be in principles scaled down to its thinnest limits. This review is aimed to systematically evaluate the potential and challenges of utilizing the thinnest advanced materials for memristor and memtransistor&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
The Si&#8208;based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling&#8208;down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in&#8208;memory computing and energy&#8208;efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle and device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformities hinder its mass production. 2D materials, as a new type of semiconductor, is successfully employed in various micro/nanoelectronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology. This review evaluates the potential of using the thinnest advanced materials, that is, monolayer 2D materials, for memristor or memtransistor applications, including resistive switching behavior and atomic mechanism, high&#8208;frequency device performances, and in&#8208;memory computing/neuromorphic computing applications. The scaling&#8208;down advantages of promising monolayer 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride are presented. Finally, the technical challenges of these atomic devices for practical applications are elaborately discussed. The study of monolayer&#8208;2D&#8208;material&#8208;based resistive memory is expected to play a positive role in the exploration of beyond&#8208;Si electronic technologies.

         <title>Performance Enhancement of the Li6PS5Cl&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries by Scavenging Lithium Dendrites with LaCl3&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the ability of Li6PS5Cl against Li dendrites for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries, inserting a thin layer of LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte inside Li6PS5Cl produces a sandwich&#8208;structured composite electrolyte, which presents greatly&#8208;improved critical current density, cycling lifetime and rate capability. The enhancing mechanism is assigned to the Li&#8208;scavenging capability of the LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte.








Abstract
Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) is a very attractive sulfide solid electrolyte for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, it cannot suppress the growth of lithium dendrites and then can only tolerate a small critical current density (CCD) before getting short&#8208;circuited to death. Learning from that a newly&#8208;developed LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte (LTLC) can afford a very large CCD, a three&#8208;layer sandwich&#8208;structured electrolyte is designed by inserting LTLC inside LPSC. Remarkably, compared with bland LPSC, this hybrid electrolyte LPSC/LTLC/LPSC presents extraordinary performance improvements: the CCD gets increased from 0.51 to 1.52&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the lifetime gets prolonged from 7&#160;h to &gt;500&#160;h at the cycling current of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and the cyclability gets extended from 10 cycles to &gt;200 cycles at the cycling rate of 0.5&#160;C and 30&#160;&#176;C in Li|electrolyte|NCM721 full cells. The enhancing reasons are assigned to the capability of LTLC to scavenge lithium dendrites, forming a passive layer of Ta, La, and LiCl.

         <title>Pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene Stabilizes Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces for Sodium&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells of 145 Wh Kg&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (FPPN) simultaneously serves as a functional electrolyte additive to stabilize cathode electrolyte interphase and solid electrolyte interlayer. The fluorine atoms&#160;and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated &#9472;P&#63742;N&#9472; structure of FPPN can promote reduction and oxidation, respectively. 5 Ah sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with FPPN demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The energy density is as high as 145 Wh kg&#8208;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries are competitive candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage batteries due to the abundant sodium resource. However, the electrode interface in the conventional electrolyte is unstable, deteriorating the cycle life of the cells. Introducing functional electrolyte additives can generate stable electrode interfaces. Here, pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (FPPN) serves as a functional electrolyte additive to stabilize the interfaces of the layered oxide cathode and the hard carbon anode. The fluorine substituting groups and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated &#9472;P&#63742;N&#9472; structure decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and increase the highest occupied molecular orbital of FPPN, respectively, realizing the preferential reduction and oxidization of FPPN on the anode and cathode simultaneously, which results in the formation of a uniform, ultrathin, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interlayer and cathode electrolyte interphase. The sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells of 5 Ah capacity rather than coin cells are assembled to evaluate the effect of FPPN. It can retain a high capacity of 4.46 Ah after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a low decay ratio of 0.01% per cycle. The pouch cell also achieves a high energy density of 145&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a wide operating temperature of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C. This work can attract more attention to the rational electrolyte design for practical applications.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2d Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement of domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial FGT synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8764;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.

Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance-state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement of domain wall number modulation in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi-domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full-current-driven artificial FGT synapses with multi-state switching, a high accuracy of &#8764;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, we propose the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8764;6&#8764;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of our system displayed a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reached a meager energy cost (&#8764;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. We anticipate that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

         <title>Engineered Surfaces that Promote Capture of Latent Proteins to Facilitate Integrin&#8208;Mediated Mechanical Activation of Growth Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional osteogenic platforms utilize active growth factors to repair bone defects that are extensive in size, but they can adversely affect patient health. Here, we report an unconventional osteogenic platform that functions by promoting capture of inactive osteogenic growth factor molecules to the site of cell growth for subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation, using a recombinant fragment of latent transforming growth factor beta&#8208;binding protein&#8208;1 (rLTBP1). We show that rLTBP1 binds to the growth factor&#8208; and integrin&#8208;binding domains of fibronectin on poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces, which immobilises rLTBP1 and promotes the binding of latency associated peptide (LAP), within which inactive TGF&#8208;&#946;1 is bound. rLTBP1 facilitates the interaction of LAP with integrin &#946;1 and the subsequent mechanically driven release of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 to stimulate canonical TGF&#8208;&#946;1 signalling, activating osteogenic marker expression in&#8208;vitro and complete regeneration of a critical&#8208;sized bone defect in&#8208;vivo.

         <title>In Situ Insights into Cathode Calcination for Predictive Synthesis: Kinetic Crystallization of LiNiO2 from Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Calcination is a solid&#8208;state synthesis process widely deployed in battery cathode manufacturing. However, its inherent complexity associated with elusive intermediates hinders predictive synthesis of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Here, we use correlative in situ X&#8208;ray absorption/scattering spectroscopy to investigate the calcination of nickel&#8208;based cathodes, focusing specifically on LiNiO2 synthesized from hydroxides. By combining in situ observation with data&#8208;driven analysis, we reveal concurrent lithiation and dehydration of Ni(OH)2 and, consequently, the low&#8208;temperature crystallization of layered LiNiO2 alongside lithiated rocksalts despite its thermodynamic unfavorability. Following early nucleation, layered LiNiO2 undergoes sluggish crystallization and structural ordering while depleting rocksalts until full lithiation. Subsequent high&#8208;temperature sintering induces rapid crystal growth, accompanied by undesired delithiation and structural degradation. These observations are further corroborated by mesoscale modeling, emphasizing that, even though calcination is thermally driven and favors transformation towards thermodynamically equilibrium phases, the actual phase propagation and crystallization can be kinetically tuned via lithiation to achieve structural and morphological control during the calcination process.

         <title>Rapid Volumetric Bioprinting of Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)&#8208;based hydrogels are widely applied to additive biomanufacturing strategies for relevant applications. The extracellular matrix components and growth factors of dECM play a crucial role in cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation. However, the generally poor mechanical properties and printability have remained as major limitations for dECM&#8208;based materials. In this study, heart&#8208;derived dECM (h&#8208;dECM) and meniscus&#8208;derived dECM (Ms&#8208;dECM) bioinks in their pristine, unmodified state supplemented with the photoinitiator of tris(2,2&#8208;bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate and sodium persulfate, demonstrate cytocompatibility with volumetric bioprinting processes. This recently developed bioprinting modality illuminates a dynamically evolving light pattern into a rotating volume of the bioink, and thus decouples the requirement of mechanical strengths of bioprinted hydrogel constructs with printability, allowing for the fabrication of sophisticated shapes and architectures with low&#8208;concentration dECM materials that set within tens of seconds. As exemplary applications, cardiac tissues are volumetrically bioprinted using the cardiomyocyte&#8208;laden h&#8208;dECM bioink showing favorable cell proliferation, expansion, spreading, biomarker expression, and synchronized contractions; whereas the volumetrically bioprinted Ms&#8208;dECM meniscus structures embedded with human mesenchymal stem cells present appropriate chondrogenic differentiation outcomes. This study supplies expanded bioink libraries for volumetric bioprinting and broadens utilities of dECM towards tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Giant Negative Photoresponse in Van Der Waals Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/Graphene Trilayer Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The positive photoconductive (PPC) effect is a well&#8208;established primary detection mechanism employed by photodetectors. In contrast, the negative photoconductive (NPC) effect has not been extensively investigated thus far, and research on the NPC effect is still in its early stage. Herein, a quaternary van der Waals material, AgBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is discovered to achieve a giant NPC effect. Through experimental observations in a Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/ Graphene&#8208;based vertical photodetector, we have identified an irreversible conversion from common PPC photoresponse to atypical NPC photoresponse. Notably, this device demonstrates an exceptionally high negative responsivity (R) of 4.9 &#215; 105 A/W, surpassing the previous records for NPC photodetectors. Additionally, it exhibits remarkable optoelectronic performances, including an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.3 &#215; 108% and a detectivity (D) of 3.60 &#215; 1012 Jones. The exceptionally high NPC photoresponse observed in our device can be attributed to the swift suppression of photogenerated free carriers at robust recombination centers (RCs) situated at significant depths, induced by the elevated drain&#8208;source voltage bias. The remarkably high NPC photoresponse also positions AgBiP2Se6 as a promising 2D material for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and an excellent platform for systematic exploration of the NPC effect.

Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1&#160;M&#160;LiBOB in&#160;GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10,000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8208;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25,000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

         <title>Printable Liquid Metal Foams That Grow When Watered</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pastes and &#8220;foams&#8221; containing liquid metal as the continuous phase (LMFs) exhibit metallic properties while displaying paste or putty&#8208;like rheological behavior. These properties enable LMFs to be patterned into soft and stretchable electrical and thermal conductors through processes conducted at room temperature, such as printing. The simplest LMFs, featured in this work, are made by stirring liquid metal in air, thereby entraining oxide&#8208;lined air &#8220;pockets&#8221; into the liquid metal. Here, we report that mixing small amounts of water (as low as 1wt%) into such LMFs gives rise to significant foaming by harnessing known reactions that evolve hydrogen and produce oxides. The resulting structures can be &#8764;4&#8208;5x their original volume and possess a fascinating combination of attributes: porosity, electrical conductivity, and responsiveness to environmental conditions. This expansion can be utilized for a type of 4D printing in which patterned conductors &#8220;grow&#8221;, fill cavities, and change shape and density with respect to time. Excessive exposure to water in the long term ultimately consumes the metal in the LMF. However, when exposure to water is controlled, the metallic properties of porous LMFs can be preserved. We characterize the physical changes of water&#8208;containing LMFs and explore prospective applications including a &#8220;growing&#8221; conductor that fills a gap in a circuit and an untethered pressure&#8208;driven actuator. We also demonstrate the printability of LMFs and present a printed pattern that changes shape over time.

         <title>Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, we pioneer a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs&#8221;. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanocarbons: From Synthesis and Structure to Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocarbons are emerging at the forefront of nanoscience, with diverse carbon nanoforms emerging over the last two decades. Early cancer diagnosis and therapy, driven by advanced chemistry techniques, play a pivotal role in mitigating mortality rates associated with cancer. Nanocarbons, with an attractive combination of well&#8208;defined architectures, biocompatibility, and nanoscale dimension, offer an incredibly versatile platform for cancer imaging and therapy. This paper aims to review the underlying principles regarding the controllable synthesis, fluorescence origins, cellular toxicity, and surface functionalization routes of several classes of nanocarbons: carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and carbon nanohorns. This review also highlights recent breakthroughs regarding the green synthesis of different nanocarbons from renewable sources. It also presents a comprehensive and unified overview of the latest cancer&#8208;related applications of nanocarbons and how they could be designed to interface with biological systems and work as cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools. The commercial status for large&#8208;scale manufacturing of nanocarbons is also presented. Finally, it proposes future research opportunities aimed at engendering modifiable and high&#8208;performance nanocarbons for emerging applications across medical industries. This work is envisioned as a cornerstone to guide interdisciplinary teams in crafting fluorescent nanocarbons with tailored attributes that can revolutionize cancer diagnostics and therapy.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) has been impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here we report our findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. We methodically computed the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, our findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate our computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600&#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600&#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000 hours when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

&lt;p&gt;The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon-neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass-derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for A Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object's motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, we present a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) that implements the Hassenstein&#8208;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, we developed a neuromorphic system employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the NGSIM dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

         <title>Facilitating Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Orbital Hybridization for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Marvelous Air Stability, Controllable High Voltage, and Anion Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on orbital hybridization theory, the challenges of layered oxide cathodes in terms of air stability, high voltage, anion redox chemistry, and improving the intrinsic characteristics through interactions between the 3d/4d transition metal and the O 2p atomic orbitals are summarized. This strategy of modulating orbitals hybridization will promote the development of sodium layered oxide cathodes and its commercialization process.








Abstract
Layered oxides have become the research focus of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low cost, simple synthesis process, and high specific capacity. However, the poor air stability, unstable phase structure under high voltage, and slow anionic redox kinetics hinder their commercial application. In recent years, the concept of manipulating orbital hybridization has been proposed to simultaneously regulate the microelectronic structure and modify the surface chemistry environment intrinsically. In this review, the hybridization modes between atoms in 3d/4d transition metal (TM) orbitals and O 2p orbitals near the region of the Fermi energy level (EF) are summarized based on orbital hybridization theory and first&#8208;principles calculations as well as various sophisticated characterizations. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms are explored from macro&#8208;scale to micro&#8208;scale, including enhancing air stability, modulating high working voltage, and stabilizing anionic redox chemistry. Meanwhile, the origin, formation conditions, and different types of orbital hybridization, as well as its application in layered oxide cathodes are presented, which provide insights into the design and preparation of cathode materials. Ultimately, the main challenges in the development of orbital hybridization and its potential for the production application are also discussed, pointing out the route for high&#8208;performance practical sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>4D Printed Non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;Plate Jellyfish Inspired Soft Robot in Diverse Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robot movement in organic solvents is a formidable challenge in robot technology. This study proposes a 4D&#8208;programmable strategy based on a low&#8208;crosslinked network to fabricate a non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate and jellyfish&#8208;inspired soft robot capable of swimming in diverse organic solvents.








Abstract
Soft robots have the potential to assist and complement human exploration of extreme and harsh environments (i.e., organic solvents). However, soft robots with stable performance in diverse organic solvents are not developed yet. In the current research, a non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate under&#8208;liquid soft robot inspired by jellyfish based on phototropic liquid crystal elastomers is fabricated via a 4D&#8208;programmable strategy. Specifically, the robot employs a 3D&#8208;printed non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate, designed with Archimedean orientation, which undergoes autonomous deformation to release internal stress when immersed in organic solvents. With the assistance of near&#8208;infrared light illumination, the organic solvent inside the robot vaporizes and generates propulsion in the form of bubble streams. The developed NEP&#8208;Jelly&#8208;inspired soft robot can swim with a high degree of freedom in various organic solvents, for example, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, and trichloromethane, which is not reported before. Besides bionic jellyfish, various aquatic invertebrate&#8208;inspired soft robots can potentially be prepared via a similar 4D&#8208;programmable strategy.

         <title>High Performance and Reprocessable In Situ Generated Nanofiber Reinforced Composites Based on Liquid Crystal Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of NDA with kinked structure into liquid crystal polyarylate promotes the formation of in situ generated NFRC which possesses superior reprocessability and unprecedent thermomechanical properties. And the NFRC based TENG exhibits superior electrical output performance retention rate (&gt; 90%) after being reprocessed and adapts to diverse working modes.








Abstract
Polymers are playing important roles in the rapid development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs); However, most polymers cannot meet the high requirements of thermomechanical performance; Thus, various polymeric composites are developed for triboelectric layer. These composites are hardly recycled since their reinforcements are unevenly distributed after reprocessing, which limits the sustainable development of TENGs. To solve the above challenges, in situ generated nanofiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) based on single&#8208;component liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP) are designed and prepared via a one&#8208;step polycondensation. Nonlinear naphthalene (NDA) widens the processing window of LCP without destabilizing the liquid crystal phase. The NDA&#8208;rich domains act as a matrix while the NDA&#8208;poor domains with higher rigidity form oriented nanofibers to achieve self&#8208;reinforcement. The resultant NFRCs possess high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt; 220 &#176;C) and storage modulus (E&#8242; = 0.1&#160;GPa at 350 &#176;C), which are far beyond existing triboelectric polymers, typically Tg &lt; 110 &#176;C and E&#8242; &lt; 0.1&#160;MPa (flowable) at 350 &#176;C. Furthermore, NFRC&#8208;based TENG exhibits superior electrical output performance and retention rate (&gt;90%) after reprocessing; Overall, this work offers a new design principle to prepare self&#8208;reinforced composites, which paves a way to explore high performance materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Surface Area Mesoporous Sc2O3 with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies as New and Advanced Electrocatalyst for Electrochemical Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New high&#8208;surface area Sc2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies (VO) is designed for high efficient electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid, a green and sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived terephthalic acidfor the establishment of a circular plastic economy.








Abstract
Scandium oxide (Sc2O3) is considered as omnipotent &#8220;Industrial Ajinomoto&#8221; and holds promise in catalytic applications. However, rarely little attention is paid to its electrochemistry. Here, the first nanocasting design of high&#8208;surface area Sc2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies (mesoporous VO&#8208;Sc2O3) for efficient electrochemical biomass valorization is reported. In the case of the electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), quantitative HMF conversion, high yield, and high faradic efficiency of FDCA via the hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid pathway are achieved by this advanced electrocatalyst. The beneficial effect of the VO on the electrocatalytic performance of the mesoporous VO&#8208;Sc2O3 is revealed by the enhanced adsorption of reactants and the reduced energy barrier in the electrochemical process. The concerted design, in situ and ex situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations shown in this work should shed light on the rational elaboration of advanced electrocatalysts, and contribute to the establishment of a circular carbon economy since the bio&#8208;plastic monomer and green hydrogen are efficiently synthesized.

&lt;p&gt;New high-surface area Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with abundant oxygen vacancies (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed for high efficient electro-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, a green and sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived terephthalic acidfor the establishment of a circular plastic economy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scandium oxide (Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is considered as omnipotent &#8220;Industrial Ajinomoto&#8221; and holds promise in catalytic applications. However, rarely little attention is paid to its electrochemistry. Here, the first nanocasting design of high-surface area Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with abundant oxygen vacancies (mesoporous V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for efficient electrochemical biomass valorization is reported. In the case of the electro-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), quantitative HMF conversion, high yield, and high faradic efficiency of FDCA via the hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid pathway are achieved by this advanced electrocatalyst. The beneficial effect of the V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; on the electrocatalytic performance of the mesoporous V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed by the enhanced adsorption of reactants and the reduced energy barrier in the electrochemical process. The concerted design, in situ and ex situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations shown in this work should shed light on the rational elaboration of advanced electrocatalysts, and contribute to the establishment of a circular carbon economy since the bio-plastic monomer and green hydrogen are efficiently synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Reproducible is the Synthesis of Zr&#8211;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks? An Interlaboratory Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It performed an interlaboratory study of the synthesis of the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224. Ten participants independently synthesized the two MOFs and the products are analyzed, primarily by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The success rates are low (one&#8208;three samples corresponding to a pure sample of the correct phase), thus highlighting the problems with irreproducibility in MOF synthesis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of materials that offer great promise in various applications. However, the synthesis remains challenging: for example, a range of crystal structures can often be accessed from the same building blocks, which complicates the phase selectivity. Likewise, the high sensitivity to slight changes in synthesis conditions may cause reproducibility issues. This is crucial, as it hampers the research and commercialization of affected MOFs. Here, it presents the first&#8208;ever interlaboratory study of the synthetic reproducibility of two Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOFs, PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224, to investigate the scope of this problem. For PCN&#8208;222, only one sample out of ten was&#160;phase pure and of the correct symmetry, while for PCN&#8208;224, three are phase pure, although none of these show the spatial linker order characteristic of PCN&#8208;224. Instead, these samples resemble dPCN&#8208;224 (disordered PCN&#8208;224), which has recently been reported. The variability in thermal behavior, defect content, and surface area of the synthesised samples are also studied. The results have important ramifications for field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their crystallization, by highlighting the synthetic challenges associated with a multi&#8208;variable synthesis space and flat energy landscapes characteristic of&#160;MOFs.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Exhibiting Amplified Spontaneous Emission Waveguides with Standard Red Chromaticity of the Rec.2020 Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel organic crystals that display mechanical elasticity and flexible optical waveguides and amplified spontaneous emissions with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.71, 0.29), matching the red emission standard of the rec.2020 gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, are reported.








Abstract
The use of mechanically flexible molecular crystals as optical transuding media is demonstrated for a plethora of applications; however, the spectral peaks of optical outputs located mainly in the range of 400&#8211;600&#160;nm are insufficient for practical telecommunication and full&#8208;color display applications. Herein, two elastically bendable organic crystals are reported that show red emission of the rec.709 gamut under 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation yet generate rec.2020 gamut red optical waveguides and amplified spontaneous emissions when irradiated by a 355&#160;nm laser. Capitalizing on the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and donor&#8211;acceptor character, as well as mechanical elasticity, these organic crystals exhibit flexible optical waveguides with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.70, 0.29), nearly identical to the red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut required for ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) displays. Notably, one of the elastic crystals functions as a soft resonance cavity, resulting in amplified spontaneous emission waveguides with CIE coordinates of (0.71, 0.29) and the standard red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut, both in straight and bent states. This study presents a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;purity red&#8208;emissive crystalline materials to create all&#8208;organic, lightweight, and mechanically compliant optical telecommunication and UHD display devices.

         <title>Bloch Point Quadrupole Constituting Hybrid Topological Strings Revealed with Electron Holographic Vector Field Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic monopoles are found to link skyrmions and antiskyrmions into hybrid 3D textures via vector field electron tomography. These hybrid strings have a 3D topology that is tunable via the application of an external field, changes in sample thickness, and DMI strength. This discovery paves the way for topologically tunable spintronics devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic (anti)skyrmions are robust string&#8208;like objects heralded as potential components in next&#8208;generation topological spintronics devices due to their low&#8208;energy manipulability via stimuli such as magnetic fields, heat, and electric/thermal current. While these 2D topological objects are widely studied, intrinsically 3D electron&#8208;spin real&#8208;space topology remains less explored despite its prevalence in bulky magnets. 2D&#8208;imaging studies reveal peculiar vortex&#8208;like contrast in the core regions of spin textures present in antiskyrmion&#8208;hosting thin plate magnets with S4 crystal symmetry, suggesting a more complex 3D real&#8208;space structure than the 2D model suggests. Here, holographic vector field electron tomography captures the 3D structure of antiskyrmions in a single&#8208;crystal, precision&#8208;doped (Fe0.63Ni0.3Pd0.07)3P (FNPP) lamellae at room temperature and zero field. These measurements reveal hybrid string&#8208;like solitons composed of skyrmions with topological number W = &#8722;1 on the lamellae's surfaces and an antiskyrmion (W = + 1) connecting them. High&#8208;resolution images uncover a Bloch point quadrupole (four magnetic (anti)monopoles that are undetectable in 2D imaging) which enables the observed lengthwise topological transitions. Numerical calculations corroborate the stability of hybrid strings over their conventional (anti)skyrmion counterparts. Hybrid strings result in topological tuning, a tunable topological Hall effect, and the suppression of skyrmion Hall motion, disrupting existing paradigms within spintronics.

         <title>Repeatedly Programmable Liquid Crystal Dielectric Elastomer with Multimodal Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple electric actuation modes can be achieved in a single liquid crystal dielectric elastomer based on its reversible shape changing between the permanent and temporary shape. The independent programmability of these two shapes offers high freedom to fabricate multimodal dielectric actuators with designable actions, which can be triggered at a low electric field due to the space charge mechanism.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are actuatable under an electric field, whose large strain and fast response speed compare favorably with natural muscles. However, the actuation of DE&#8208;based devices is generally limited to a single mode and cannot be reconfigured after fabrication, which pales in comparison to biological counterparts given the ability to alter actuation modes according to external conditions. To address this, liquid crystal dielectric elastomers (LC&#8208;DEs) that can alter the dielectric actuation modes based on the thermally triggered shape&#8208;changing are prepared. Specifically, the two shapes through the LC phase transition possess different bending stiffness, which leads to distinct actuation modes after an electric field is applied. Moreover, the two shapes can be individually programmed/reprogrammed, that is, the one before the transition is regulated through force&#8208;directed solvent evaporation and the one after the transition is via bond exchange&#8208;enabled stress relaxation. As such, the multimodal dielectric actuation behaviors upon temperature change can be readily diversified. Meanwhile, the space charge mechanism endows LC&#8208;DEs with the significantly reduced driving e&#8208;field (8 V &#181;m&#8722;1) and bidirectional actuation manners. It is believed this unique adaptivity in the actuation modes under a low electric field shall offer versatile designs for practical soft robots.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are particularly attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage and electric vehicles due to their exceptional safety, abundant resource availability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The growing demand for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries underscores the significance of sodium solid electrolytes. However, the existed challenges of sodium solid electrolytes hinder their practical application despite continuous research efforts. Herein, we review recent advancements and the challenges for sodium solid electrolytes from material to battery level. The in&#8208;depth understanding of their fundamental properties, synthesis techniques, crystal structures and recent breakthroughs are presented. Moreover, critical challenges on inorganic sodium solid electrolytes are emphasized, including the imperative need to enhance ionic conductivity, fortifying interfacial compatibility with anode/cathode materials, and addressing dendrite formation issues. Finally, potential applications of these inorganic sodium solid electrolytes are explored in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries and emerging battery systems, offering insights into future research directions.

         <title>Functionality Modulation Towards Thianthrene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is of significant importance but has been rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in HER and OER. Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, we have introduced a systematic strategy for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C = C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed us to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieved a current density of 10 mAcm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of approximately 65&#160;mV (in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4) and around 283&#160;mV (in 1&#160;M KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibited superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, our investigations demonstrated that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 hours of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

         <title>Intestinal Delivery of Probiotics: Materials, Strategies, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Probiotics with diverse and crucial functions and properties have attracted broad interest from many researchers, who adopt intestinal delivery of probiotics to modulate the gut microbiota. However, the major problems faced for the therapeutic applications of probiotics are the viability and colonization of probiotics during their processing, intake, and subsequent delivery to the gut. The challenges of simple oral delivery (stability, controllability, targeting, etc.) have greatly limited the use of probiotics in clinical therapies. Nanotechnology can endow the probiotics to be delivered to the intestine with improved survival rate and increased resistance to the adverse environment. Additionally, the progress in synthetic biology has created new opportunities for efficiently and purposefully designing and manipulating the probiotics. In this article, we present a brief overview of the types of probiotics for intestinal delivery, the current progress of different probiotic encapsulation strategies, including the chemical, physical, and genetic strategies and their combinations, and the emerging single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategies using nanocoating methods. The action mechanisms of probiotics that are responsible for eliciting beneficial effects are also briefly discussed. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic applications of engineered probiotics, and the future trends toward developing engineered probiotics with advanced features and improved health benefits.

         <title>Tunable 2D Electron&#8208; and 2D Hole States Observed at Fe/SrTiO3 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of carriers &#8208; either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged holes. Here, we provide direct evidence for individually emerging n&#8208; or p&#8208;type 2D band dispersions in STO&#8208;based heterostructures using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of an adjacent Fe&#8208;based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty band gap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208; derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, an 2D electron system is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole&#8208;type interfaces, which as of yet had been exclusively assigned to the emergence of 2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a redox overlayer. This will extend the spectrum of phenomena in oxide electronics, including the realization of combined n/p&#8208;type all&#8208;oxide transistors or logic&#160;gates.

         <title>Hot&#8208;carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, we introduce tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices showed excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Material Volumetric Additive Manufacturing of Hydrogels Using Gelatin as A Sacrificial Network And 3d Suspension Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging layerless method for the rapid processing of reactive resins into 3D structures, where printing is much faster (seconds) than other lithography and direct ink writing methods (minutes to hours). As a vial of resin rotates in the VAM process, patterned light exposure defines a 3D object and then resin that has not undergone gelation can be washed away. Despite the promise of VAM, there are challenges with the printing of soft hydrogel materials from non&#8208;viscous precursors, including into multi&#8208;material constructs. To address this, we use sacrificial gelatin to modulate resin viscosity to support the cytocompatible VAM printing of macromers based on poly(ethylene glycol), hyaluronic acid (HA), and polyacrylamide. After printing, gelatin is removed by washing at an elevated temperature. To print multi&#8208;material constructs, the gelatin&#8208;containing resin is used as a shear&#8208;yielding suspension bath (including HA to further modulate bath properties) where an ink can be extruded into the bath to define a multi&#8208;material resin that can then be processed with VAM into a defined object. Multi&#8208;material constructs of methacrylated HA and gelatin methacrylamide are printed (as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept) with encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells, where the local hydrogel properties define cell spreading behavior with culture.

&lt;p&gt;Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging layerless method for the rapid processing of reactive resins into 3D structures, where printing is much faster (seconds) than other lithography and direct ink writing methods (minutes to hours). As a vial of resin rotates in the VAM process, patterned light exposure defines a 3D object and then resin that has not undergone gelation can be washed away. Despite the promise of VAM, there are challenges with the printing of soft hydrogel materials from non-viscous precursors, including into multi-material constructs. To address this, we use sacrificial gelatin to modulate resin viscosity to support the cytocompatible VAM printing of macromers based on poly(ethylene glycol), hyaluronic acid (HA), and polyacrylamide. After printing, gelatin is removed by washing at an elevated temperature. To print multi-material constructs, the gelatin-containing resin is used as a shear-yielding suspension bath (including HA to further modulate bath properties) where an ink can be extruded into the bath to define a multi-material resin that can then be processed with VAM into a defined object. Multi-material constructs of methacrylated HA and gelatin methacrylamide are printed (as proof-of-concept) with encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells, where the local hydrogel properties define cell spreading behavior with culture.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Integrating Light Diffusion and Conversion Layers for Highly Efficient Multicolored Fiber&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell integrated with light diffusion and conversion layers efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for more light harvesting, producing a record power conversion efficiency of 13.11%. It can be also made with color&#8208;tunable appearance and further integrated with fiber battery as next&#8208;generation power system.








Abstract
Fiber solar cells as promising wearable power supplies have attracted increasing attentions recently, while further breakthrough on their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and realization of multicolored appearances remain urgent needs particularly in real&#8208;world applications. Here, a fiber&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (FDSSC) integrated with a light diffusion layer composed of alumina/polyurethane film on the outmost encapsulating tube and a light conversion layer made from phosphors/TiO2/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) film on the inner counter electrode is designed. The incident light is diffused to more surfaces of fiber electrodes, then converted on counter electrode and reflected to neighboring photoanode, so the FDSSC efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for remarkably enhanced light harvesting, producing a record PCE of 13.11%. These efficient FDSSCs also realize color&#8208;tunable appearances, improving their designability and compatibility with textiles. They are further integrated with fiber batteries as power systems, providing a power solution for wearables and emerging smart textiles.

         <title>Surface Engineered Single&#8208;atom Systems for Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support surface engineering to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a promising strategy for energy conversion due to the various advantageous properties. This review summarizes the research progress in surface&#8208;engineered SACs for energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and different devices, which is anticipated to promote the rational design and development of SACs with surface engineering for advanced energy conversion.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are demonstrated to show exceptional reactivity and selectivity in catalytic reactions by effectively utilizing metal species, making them a favorable choice among the different active materials for energy conversion. However, SACs are still in the early stages of energy conversion, and problems like agglomeration and low energy conversion efficiency are hampering their practical applications. Substantial research focus on support modifications, which are vital for SAC reactivity and stability due to the intimate relationship between metal atoms and support. In this review, a category of supports and a variety of surface engineering strategies employed in SA systems are summarized, including surface site engineering (heteroatom doping, vacancy introducing, surface groups grafting, and coordination tunning) and surface structure engineering (size/morphology control, cocatalyst deposition, facet engineering, and crystallinity control). Also, the merits of support surface engineering in single&#8208;atom systems are systematically introduced. Highlights are the comprehensive summary and discussions on the utilization of surface&#8208;engineered SACs in diversified energy conversion applications including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and energy conversion devices. At the end of this review, the potential and obstacles of using surface&#8208;engineered SACs in the field of energy conversion are discussed. This review aims to guide the rational design and manipulation of SACs for target&#8208;specific applications by capitalizing on the characteristic benefits of support surface engineering.

         <title>Digital Multiphase Composites via Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphase composites created using additive manufacturing exhibit a wide range of mechanical behaviors relevant to synthetic tissues, and allow designers to exert unprecedented control over local material properties.








Abstract
Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi&#8208;dimensional material property requirements. In this work, continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties is demonstrated in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents are experimentally characterized, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, inverse material design is enabled; the method is showcased by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. The properties of these composites are placed in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue&#160;mimics.

         <title>Controlling Film Formation and Host&#8208;Guest Interactions to Enhance the Thermoelectric Properties of Nickel&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general, dynamically controlled on&#8208;surface synthesis method and controlling host&#8208;guest interactions, record electrical conductivity (100 &#8211; 200 S cm&#8211;1) and high thermoelectric power factors up to 10 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are demonstrated in nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;based 2D conductive coordination polymers and their charge transport physics are elucidated.








Abstract
2D conjugated coordination polymers (cCPs) based on square&#8208;planar transition metal&#8208;complexes (such as MO4, M(NH)4, and MS4, M = metal) are an emerging class of (semi)conducting materials that are of great interest for applications in supercapacitors, catalysis, and thermoelectrics. Finding synthetic approaches to high&#8208;performance nickel&#8208;nitrogen (Ni&#8208;N) based cCP films is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a general, dynamically controlled on&#8208;surface synthesis that produces highly conductive Ni&#8208;N&#8208;based cCP films is developed and the thermoelectric properties as a function of the molecular structure and their dependence on interactions with ambient atmosphere are studied. Among the four studied cCPs with different ligand sizes hexaminobenzene&#8208; and hexaaminotriphenylene&#8208;based films exhibit record electrical conductivity (100&#8211;200 S cm&#8211;1) in this Ni&#8208;N based cCP family, which is one order of magnitude higher than previous reports, and the highest thermoelectric power factors up to 10 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 among reported 2D cCPs. The transport physics of these films is studied and it is shown that depending on the host&#8208;guest interaction with oxygen/water the majority carrier type and the value of the Seebeck coefficient can be largely regulated. The high conductivity is likely reflecting good interconnectivity between (small) ordered domains and grain boundaries supporting disordered metallic transport.

         <title>Injectable Self&#8208;Expanding/Self&#8208;Propelling Hydrogel Adhesive with Procoagulant Activity and Rapid Gelation for Lethal Massive Hemorrhage Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable antibacterial hydrogels with self&#8208;expanding/self&#8208;propelling, wet tissue adhesiveness, procoagulant activity, and rapid gelation are prepared based on CO2 foaming and Schiff base crosslinking. Due to the combination of efficient coagulation, plugging of bleeding site, and tissue adhesiveness, the hydrogel is effective in stopping fatal massive and/or noncompressible hemorrhages on wet tissue surfaces, at the extremity junctions and at the torso.








Abstract
Developing hydrogels that can quickly reach deep bleeding sites, adhere to wounds, and expand to stop lethal and/or noncompressible bleeding in civil and battlefield environments remains a challenge. Herein, an injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel bioadhesive with procoagulant activity and rapid gelation is reported. This hydrogel combines spontaneous gas foaming and rapid Schiff base crosslinking for lethal massive hemorrhage. Hydrogels have rapid gelation and expansion rate, high self&#8208;expanding ratio, excellent antibacterial activity, antioxidant efficiency, and tissue adhesion capacity. In addition, hydrogels have good cytocompatibility, procoagulant ability, and higher blood cell/platelet adhesion activity than commercial combat gauze and gelatin sponge. The optimized hydrogel (OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30) exhibits better hemostatic ability than combat gauze and gelatin sponge in rat liver and femoral artery bleeding models, rabbit volumetric liver loss massive bleeding models with/without anticoagulant, and rabbit liver and kidney incision bleeding models with bleeding site not visible. Especially, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 rapidly stops the bleedings from pelvic area of rabbit, and swine subclavian artery vein transection. Furthermore, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 has biodegradability and biocompatibility, and accelerates Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected skin wound healing. This injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel opens up a new avenue to develop hemostats for lethal massive bleeding, abdominal organ bleeding, and bleeding from coagulation lesions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing hydrogels that can quickly reach deep bleeding sites, adhere to wounds, and expand to stop lethal and/or noncompressible bleeding in civil and battlefield environments remains a challenge. Herein, an injectable, antibacterial, self-expanding, and self-propelling hydrogel bioadhesive with procoagulant activity and rapid gelation is reported. This hydrogel combines spontaneous gas foaming and rapid Schiff base crosslinking for lethal massive hemorrhage. Hydrogels have rapid gelation and expansion rate, high self-expanding ratio, excellent antibacterial activity, antioxidant efficiency, and tissue adhesion capacity. In addition, hydrogels have good cytocompatibility, procoagulant ability, and higher blood cell/platelet adhesion activity than commercial combat gauze and gelatin sponge. The optimized hydrogel (OD-C/QGQL-A30) exhibits better hemostatic ability than combat gauze and gelatin sponge in rat liver and femoral artery bleeding models, rabbit volumetric liver loss massive bleeding models with/without anticoagulant, and rabbit liver and kidney incision bleeding models with bleeding site not visible. Especially, OD-C/QGQL-A30 rapidly stops the bleedings from pelvic area of rabbit, and swine subclavian artery vein transection. Furthermore, OD-C/QGQL-A30 has biodegradability and biocompatibility, and accelerates Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA)-infected skin wound healing. This injectable, antibacterial, self-expanding, and self-propelling hydrogel opens up a new avenue to develop hemostats for lethal massive bleeding, abdominal organ bleeding, and bleeding from coagulation lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity of Fe3GeTe2 Crystal with Native Heterostructure for Ultraviolet to Terahertz Ultra&#8208;Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing negative photoconductivity effect in Fe3GeTe2 9crystal with native heterostructure is first reported. The resulting ferromagnetic&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature photodetector exhibits excellent responsivity of 103&#8211;100&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 level and ultra&#8208;broadband detection range covering UV&#8211;vis&#8208;IR&#8208;THz band. It surpasses most broad&#8208;spectrum photodetectors and offers the opportunity for Fe3GeTe2 materials in spin optoelectronics with ultra&#8208;low power consumption.








Abstract
Gaining insight into the photoelectric behavior of ferromagnetic materials is significant for comprehensively grasping their intrinsic properties and broadening future application fields. Here, through a specially designed Fe3GeTe2/O&#8208;Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure, first, the broad&#8208;spectrum negative photoconductivity phenomenon of ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe3GeTe2 is reported that covers UV&#8211;vis&#8208;infrared&#8208;terahertz bands (355&#160;nm to 3000&#160;&#181;m), promising to compensate for the inadequacies of traditional optoelectronic devices. The significant suppression of photoexcitation conductivity is revealed to arise from the semimetal/oxidation (sMO) interface&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;response mechanism, in which the electron excitation origins from the semiconductor photoconductivity effect in high&#8208;energy photon region, and semimetal topological band&#8208;transition in low&#8208;energy photon region. High responsivities ranging from 103 to 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 are acquired within ultraviolet&#8208;terahertz bands under &#177;0.1&#160;V bias voltage at room temperature. Notably, the responsivity of 2.572 A W&#8722;1 at 3000&#160;&#181;m (0.1 THz) and the low noise equivalent power of 26 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 surpass most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mainstream terahertz detectors. This research provides a new perspective for revealing the photoelectric conversion properties of Fe3GeTe2 crystal and paves the way for the development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Probing Electronic Band Structures of Dielectric Polymers via Pre&#8208;Breakdown Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer dielectrics with higher operational electric fields are essential elements to fulfill the future needs of pulse power, power conditioning, and electrification applications. A novel methodology is demonstrated to detect the field&#8208;and&#8208;temperature dependent conduction under extremely high prebreakdown electric field (&gt;700&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1).








Abstract
The electronic band structure, especially the defect states at the conduction band tail, dominates electron transport and electrical degradation of a dielectric material under an extremely high electric field. However, the electronic band structure in a dielectric is barely well studied due to experimental challenges in detecting the electrical conduction to an extremely high electric field, i.e., prebreakdown. In this work, the electronic band structure of polymer dielectric films is probed through an in situ prebreakdown conduction measurement method in conjunction with a space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited&#8208;current spectroscopic analysis. An exponential distribution of defect states at the conduction band tail with varying trap levels is observed in accordance with the specific morphological disorder in the polymer dielectric, and the experimental defect states show also a favorable agreement with the calculated density of states from the density functional theory. The methodology demonstrated in this work bridges the molecule&#8208;structure&#8208;determined electronic band structure and the macro electrical conduction behavior with a highly improved understanding of material properties that control the electrical breakdown, and paves a way for guiding the modification of existing material and the exploration of novel materials for high electric field applications.

         <title>Facilitating Interskin Communication in Artificial Polymer Systems through Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial liquid crystal polymer skins are employed to construct an intelligent chemical communication system, enabling the releasing, transferring, and sensing of chemical signals. Once receiving the chemical messages, the polymer skin as a receiver displays both transmittance and electric signal change. By infusing the sender and the receiver with different reagents, a reaction takes place to generate desired species.








Abstract
Chemical communication is a ubiquitous process in nature, and it has sparked interest in the development of electric&#8208;sense&#8208;based robotic perception systems with chemical components. Here, a novel liquid crystal polymer is introduced that combines the transferring, receiving, and sensing of chemical signals, providing a new principle to achieve chemical communication in robotic systems. This approach allows for the transfer of cargo between two polymer coatings, and the transfer can be monitored through an electrical signal. Additionally, cascade transfer can be achieved through this approach, as the transfer of cargo is not limited to only two coatings, but can continue from the second to a third coating. Furthermore, the two coatings can be infused with different reagents, and upon exchange, a reaction takes place to generate the desired species. The novel method of chemical communication that is developed presents a notable improvement in embodied perception. This advancement facilitates human&#8211;robot and robot&#8211;robot interactions and enhances the ability of robots to efficiently and accurately perform complex tasks in their environment.

         <title>Boosting Efficient and Sustainable Alkaline Water Oxidation on a W&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT Pair&#8208;Sites Catalyst Synthesized via Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general potential cycling topochemical transformation (&#8220;PCTT&#8221;) strategy is used to convert M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT pair sites (M = W, Mo, Mn, V) under the modulation of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals; this TT process can be confirmed by in situ
XAFS. The prepared tungsten&#8208;based pair&#8208;sites catalyst makes a breakthrough of 3000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 high current density and 1000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, the O&#9472;O bond formation process on two Co sites is well confirmed by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory, which breaks the limit of the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;sites.








Abstract
The development of facile methods for constructing highly active, cost&#8208;effective catalysts that meet ampere&#8208;level current density and durability requirements for an oxygen evolution reaction is crucial. Herein, a general topochemical transformation strategy is posited: M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are directly converted into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT (M&#8201;=&#8201;W, Mo, Mn, V) pair&#8208;sites catalysts under the role of incorporating of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals modulators through potential cycling. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy is used to track the dynamic topochemical transformation process at the atomic level. The W&#8208;Co9S8 breaks through the low overpotential of 160&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. A series of pair&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a large current density of approaching 1760&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.68&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline water oxidation and achieve a &#8776;240&#8208;fold enhancement in the normalized intrinsic activity compare to that reported CoOOH, and sustainable stability of 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the O&#9472;O bond formation is confirmed via a two&#8208;site mechanism, supported by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which breaks the limit of adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;site.

         <title>MBene with Redox&#8208;Active Terminal Groups for an Energy&#8208;Dense Cascade Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional transition metal borides (MBene) with &#8208;Br redox&#8208;active functional groups is first synthesized using CuBr2 molten salt etchant. When used as the host of iodine species, the cascade reactions of I&#8208;/I0 and Br&#8208;/Br0 can be realized. Specifically, the iodine&#8208;coated Mo1.33Y0.52B2Br1.22 (I2@MBene&#8208;Br) delivers higher specific energy and specific power than those of conventional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBenes), new members of the 2D materials family, hold great promise for use in the electrocatalytic and energy storage fields because of their high specific area, high chemical activity, and fast charge carrier mobility. Although various types of MBenes are reported, layered MBenes featuring redox&#8208;active terminal groups for high energy output are not yet produced. A facile and energy&#8208;efficient method for synthesizing MBenes equipped with redox&#8208;active terminal groups for cascade Zn||I2 batteries is presented. Layered MBenes have ordered metal vacancies and &#9472;Br terminal groups, enabling the sequential reactions of I&#8722;/I0 and Br&#8722;/Br0. The I2&#8208;hosting MBene&#8208;Br cathode results in a specific energy as high as 485.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 899.7&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a specific power as high as 6007.7&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 180.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, far exceeding the best records for Zn||I2 batteries. The results of this study demonstrate that the challenges of MBene synthesis can be overcome and reveal an efficient path for producing high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active electrode materials for energy&#8208;dense cascade aqueous batteries.

         <title>Charge Carrier Induced Structural Ordering And Disordering in Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of charge density on the stability and operation of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor is examined. Operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that charge carriers initially induce order within the crystallites at low charge densities, but further carrier density increases lead to a structural disordering of the crystallites, irreversibly decreasing conductivity and mobility.








Abstract
Operational stability underpins the successful application of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) in a wide range of fields, including biosensing, neuromorphic computing, and wearable electronics. In this work, both the operation and stability of a p&#8208;type OMIEC material of various molecular weights are investigated. Electrochemical transistor measurements reveal that device operation is very stable for at least 300 charging/discharging cycles independent of molecular weight, provided the charge density is kept below the threshold where strong charge&#8211;charge interactions become likely. When electrochemically charged to higher charge densities, an increase in device hysteresis and a decrease in conductivity due to a drop in the hole mobility arising from long&#8208;range microstructural disruptions are observed. By employing operando X&#8208;ray scattering techniques, two regimes of polaron&#8208;induced structural changes are found: 1) polaron&#8208;induced structural ordering at low carrier densities, and 2) irreversible structural disordering that disrupts charge transport at high carrier densities, where charge&#8211;charge interactions are significant. These operando measurements also reveal that the transfer curve hysteresis at high carrier densities is accompanied by an analogous structural hysteresis, providing a microstructural basis for such instabilities. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the structural dynamics and material instabilities of OMIEC materials during device operation.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate The Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, we developed a robust approach using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting (SPDF) of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. Our results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for clinical translation of drugs.

Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability were predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction (MEC) strategy was proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;Acrylamidopyridine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#956;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3. Moverover, profiting from the protection of poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite was markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gained a robust power conversion effiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintained 91% of their initial PCE for 13,008 hours in a desiccated ambient environment and retained 92% PCE after storage for 4,000 hours with a relative humidity of 50&#177;10%, which is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art long&#8208;term stability among the reported contributions.

         <title>Evolution of Grain Boundaries Promoted Hydrogen Production for Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of efficient and durable high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, we have successfully driven the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density. The optimal MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo demonstrated ultrahigh current density (&gt; 2 A cm&#8722;2) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;M KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects led to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell was also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. Our strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>Responsively Degradable Nanoarmor&#8208;Assisted Super Resistance And Stable Colonization of Probiotics for Enhanced Inflammation&#8208;Targeted Delivery</title>

Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Amorphous MnO2 Lamellae Encapsulated Covalent Triazine Polymer&#8208;Derived Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped Carbon for Orr/Oer Bifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of znic&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in&#8208;situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1 and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversations and beyond.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Noble&#8208;Metal Nanostructures Approaching Atomic Efficiency and Atomic Density Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis due to their unique physicochemical properties. For practical application, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is however formidably challenging. Here, we propose a robust strategy for fabricating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increased from 18.2% to 59.4% after the creation of atomic channels. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by atomic&#8208;resolution microstructural characterization, in situ and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation induced photoemission spectroscopy, Ar+&#8208;etching X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by creating atomic channels in amorphous Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based binary oxides. When amorphous Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) was used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than those of crystalline CuO/IrO2 and amorphous Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels lead to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6], as a result of significant decrease of energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step for OER. This work provides a promising strategy for simultaneously increasing exposed surface atoms and atomic efficiency of noble metals, which may attract immediate interests of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and have been widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches have been reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, we introduce a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma (TAP) to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150 &#8764; 200&#176;C), which could be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate. As a demonstration, we fabricated a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance was well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Expanding the Horizons of Machine Learning in Nanomaterials to Chiral Nanostructures</title>

Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating the design of novel materials, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labour&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials and nanostructures is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarised luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, we provide an analysis of machine learning methods used in studying achiral nanomaterials, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. We present an overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;application relationships and provide insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships. We also review and discuss some key recent publications on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>

Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, we develop designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, we not only achieved signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders but also revealed the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, we employed SMFs to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, we established a prognostic prediction scoring system with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). Our work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely two&#8208;dimensional multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, we&#160;use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. We&#160;demonstrate that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, we&#160;directly probe the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. Our&#160;findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way towards engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Homomultivalent Polymeric Nanotraps Disturb Lipid Metabolism Homeostasis and Tune Pyroptosis in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Genetic manipulations and pharmaceutical interventions to disturb lipid metabolism homeostasis have emerged as an attractive approach for the management of cancer. However, the research on the utilization of bioactive materials to modulate lipid metabolism homeostasis remains constrained. In this study, we have utilized heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMCD) to fabricate homomultivalent polymeric nanotraps, and surprisingly find it has an unprecedented ability to perturb lipid metabolism homeostasis and induce pyroptosis in tumor cells. Through modulation of the density of TMCD arrayed on the polymers, one top&#8208;performing nanotrap, PTMCD4, exhibits the most powerful cholesterol&#8208;trapping and depletion capacity, thus achieving prominent cytotoxicity toward different types of tumor cells and encouraging antitumor effects in vivo. The interactions between PTMCD4 and biomembranes of tumor cells effectively enable the reduction of cellular phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels, thus provoking damage to the biomembrane integrity and perturbation of lipid metabolism homeostasis. Additionally, the interplays between PTMCD4 and lysosomes also induce lysosomal stress, activate the nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain (NOD)&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, and subsequently trigger tumor cell pyroptosis. To sum up, this study first introduces dendronized bioactive polymers to manipulate lipid metabolism and has shed light on another innovative insight for cancer therapy.

Abstract
The first tunable nano&#8208;bending structures of [1]rotaxane containing a single&#8208;fluorophoric N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) moiety (i.e., [1]RA) is developed as a loosened lasso structure to feature the bright white&#8208;light emission [CIE (0.27, 0.33), &#934; = 21.2%] in THF solution, where bi&#8208;stable states of bending and twisted structures of DPAC unit in [1]RA with cyan and orange emissions at 480 and 600&#160;nm, respectively. With acid/base controls, tunable loosened/tightened nano&#8208;loops of corresponding [1]rotaxanes (i.e., [1]RA/[1]RB) can be achieved via the shuttling of macrocycles reversibly, and thus to adjust their respective white&#8208;light/cyan emissions, where the cyan emission of [1]RB is obtained due to the largest conformational constraint of DPAC moiety in its bending form of [1]RB with a tightened lasso structure. Additionally, the non&#8208;interlocked analogue M&#8208;Boc only shows the orange emission, revealing the twisted form of DPAC fluorophore in M&#8208;Boc without any conformational constraint. Moreover, the utilization of solvents (with different viscosities and polarities), temperatures, and water fractions could serve as effective tools to adjust the bi&#8208;stable vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) colors of [1]rotaxanes. Finally, tuning ratiometric emission colors of adaptive conformations of DPAC moieties by altering nano&#8208;bending structures in [1]rotaxanes and external stimuli can be further developed as intelligent temperature and viscosity sensor materials.

         <title>Inhibiting the Keap1/Nrf2 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with Protein&#8208;Like Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Successful and selective inhibition of the cytosolic protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) between nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associating protein 1 (Keap1) can enhance the antioxidant response, and has a potential therapeutic effect in a range of settings including in neurodegenerative disease. Small molecule inhibitors have been developed, yet many have off&#8208;target effects or are limited by poor cellular permeability. Peptide&#8208;based strategies have been used to enhance specificity yet face challenges due to susceptibility to degradation and lack of cellular penetration. Herein, we overcome these barriers utilizing a polymer&#8208;based proteomimetics. The protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) consists of a synthetic, lipophilic polymer backbone displaying water soluble Keap1&#8208;binding peptides on each monomer unit forming a brush polymer architecture. The PLPs are capable of engaging Keap1 and displacing the cellular protective transcription factor Nrf2, which then translocates to the nucleus, activating the antioxidant response element (ARE). PLPs exhibit increased Keap1 binding affinity by several orders of magnitude compared to free peptides, maintain serum stability, are cell&#8208;penetrant, and selectively activate the ARE pathway in cells, including in primary cortical neuronal cultures. Keap1/Nrf2&#8208;inhibitory PLPs have the potential to impact the treatment of disease states associated with dysregulation of oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt; 20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high specific surface areas are targeted (&gt; 2000 m2&#183;g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, we demonstrate a non&#8208;etching activation strategy using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and specific surface areas reaching 3008 m2&#183;g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 (567 F&#183;g&#8722;1) and durability of 100,000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Synthetic Rotary Motors in Lipid Membranes Induce Shape Changes Through Membrane Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explore the nuanced relationship between light&#8208;driven molecular motors and lipid membranes in this research. Delve into the continuous interplay, observing how these motors, akin to dynamic springs fueled by light, orchestrate subtle yet fascinating shape transitions in membranes. Observe how these out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems can modulate area expansion through their action in lipid membranes.








Abstract
Membranes are the key structures to separate and spatially organize cellular systems. Their rich dynamics and transformations during the cell cycle are orchestrated by specific membrane&#8208;targeted molecular machineries, many of which operate through energy dissipation. Likewise, man&#8208;made light&#8208;activated molecular rotary motors have previously shown drastic effects on cellular systems, but their physical roles on and within lipid membranes remain largely unexplored. Here, the impact of rotary motors on well&#8208;defined biological membranes is systematically investigated. Notably, dramatic mechanical transformations are observed in these systems upon motor irradiation, indicative of motor&#8208;induced membrane expansion. The influence of several factors on this phenomenon is systematically explored, such as motor concentration and membrane composition., Membrane fluidity is found to play a crucial role in motor&#8208;induced deformations, while only minor contributions from local heating and singlet oxygen generation are observed. Most remarkably, the membrane area expansion under the influence of the motors continues as long as irradiation is maintained, and the system stays out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. Overall, this research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of molecular motors interacting with biological membranes, elucidating the multifaceted factors that govern membrane responses and shape transitions in the presence of these remarkable molecular machines, thereby supporting their future applications in chemical&#160;biology.

         <title>Strategies for the Nuclear Delivery of Metal Complexes to Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of new antitumoral metallodrugs is a centerpiece in the fight against drug&#8208;resistant tumors. In this context, the design of novel metal complexes that display great selectivity for cancer cells and accumulate in the nucleus is one objective to strive toward. This review discusses existing strategies and perspectives for the rational design of future metallodrug candidates.








Abstract
The nucleus is an essential organelle for the function of cells. It holds most of the genetic material and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Since many antitumoral therapies target nucleic acids to induce cell death, tumor&#8208;specific nuclear drug delivery could potentiate therapeutic effects and prevent potential off&#8208;target side effects on healthy tissue. Due to their great structural variety, good biocompatibility, and unique physico&#8208;chemical properties, organometallic complexes and other metal&#8208;based compounds have sparked great interest as promising anticancer agents. In this review, strategies for specific nuclear delivery of metal complexes are summarized and discussed to highlight crucial parameters to consider for the design of new metal complexes as anticancer drug candidates. Moreover, the existing opportunities and challenges of tumor&#8208;specific, nucleus&#8208;targeting metal complexes are emphasized to outline some new perspectives and help in the design of new cancer treatments.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Advanced Sodium Storage: Development and Anticipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically provides an overview of the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks and a variety of derivatives as advanced sodium storage materials from their bottom&#8208;up synthetic protocols, sodium storage mechanisms, and electrochemical behaviors, based on which anticipations about their prospects are envisaged.








Abstract
As a pioneering battery technology, even though sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are safe, non&#8208;flammable, and capable of exhibiting better temperature endurance performance than lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because of lower energy density and larger ionic size, they are not amicable for large&#8208;scale applications. Generally, the electrochemical storage performance of a secondary battery can be improved by monitoring the composition and morphology of electrode materials. Because more is the intricacy of a nanostructured composite electrode material, more electrochemical storage applications would be expected. Despite the conventional methods suitable for practical production, the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) would offer enormous opportunities for next&#8208;generation battery applications by delicately systematizing the structure and composition at the molecular level to store sodium ions with larger sizes compared with lithium ions. Here, the review comprehensively discusses the progress of nanostructured MOFs and their derivatives applied as negative and positive electrode materials for effective sodium storage in SIBs. The commercialization goal has prompted the development of MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials, before which the synthesis and mechanism for MOF&#8208;based SIB electrodes with improved sodium storage performance are systematically discussed. Finally, the existing challenges, possible perspectives, and future opportunities will be anticipated.

         <title>Graphene Electrode for Studying CO2 Electroreduction Nanocatalysts under Realistic Conditions in Microcells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first integration of tri&#8208;layer graphene as a working electrode in liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy microcells shows advantages such as a wider inert window range for CO2 electroreduction than glassy carbon and a significant improvement in spatial resolution for electron imaging. Its application to the stability of Cu nanocubes allows operando studies at realistic potential ranges for extended reaction times.








Abstract
The ability to resolve the dynamic evolution of electrocatalytically induced processes with electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (EM)&#160;is limited by the microcell configuration. Herein, a free&#8208;standing tri&#8208;layer graphene is integrated as a membrane and electrode material into the electrochemical chip and its suitability as a substrate electrode at the high cathodic potentials required for CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) is evaluated. The three&#8208;layer stacked graphene is transferred onto an in&#8208;house fabricated single&#8208;working electrode chip for use with bulk&#8208;like reference and counter electrodes to facilitate evaluation of its effectiveness. Electrochemical measurements show that the graphene working electrode exhibits a wider inert cathodic potential range than the conventional glassy carbon electrode while achieving good charge transfer properties for nanocatalytic redox reactions. Operando scanning electron microscopy studies clearly demonstrate the improvement in spatial resolution but reveal a synergistic effect of the electron beam and the applied potential that limits the stability time window of the graphene&#8208;based electrochemical chip. By optimizing the operating conditions, in situ monitoring of Cu nanocube degradation is achieved at the CO2ER potential of &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE. Thus, this improved microcell configuration allows EM observation of catalytic processes at potentials relevant to real systems.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Trapped Bioinspired Lipoprotein Prolongs Tumor Retention to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, a protease&#8208;sensitive TNC and FN1&#8208;binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) system (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can preferentially bind to the FN1 and TNC in tumors to prolong their retention capacity, thereby profoundly potentiating the antitumor immunity and producing notable therapeutic benefits .








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effects of many therapeutic agents are significantly challenged by their insufficient delivery efficiency and short retention time in tumors. Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, herein a protease&#8208;activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP treatment produces a 6.96&#8208;, 9.24&#8208;, 6.72&#8208;, 7.32&#8208;, and 6.73&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells and their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208;, granzyme B&#8208;, perforin&#8208;, and Ki67&#8208;expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM&#8208;trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, a protease-sensitive TNC and FN1-binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix-trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) system (FTF-BL-CP) is proposed that can preferentially bind to the FN1 and TNC in tumors to prolong their retention capacity, thereby profoundly potentiating the antitumor immunity and producing notable therapeutic benefits .

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immunomodulatory effects of many therapeutic agents are significantly challenged by their insufficient delivery efficiency and short retention time in tumors. Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, herein a protease-activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix (ECM)-trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF-BL-CP) is proposed that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF-BL-CP treatment produces a 6.96-, 9.24-, 6.72-, 7.32-, and 6.73-fold increase of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and their interferon-&#947;-, granzyme B-, perforin-, and Ki67-expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF-BL-CP produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM-trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in creating polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals and electrocatalytic roles in energy conversion have been systematically summarized. The structures, synthesis, characterizations, electrocatalytic merits, and recent breakthroughs of POM molecules, POMs&#8208;based structures, and POMs&#8208;derived electrocatalysts have been discussed. Notably, the essences and mechanisms of how POMs&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities are outlined.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular metal oxide cluster with unique physical&#8211;chemical properties, have made essential contributions to creating efficient and robust electrocatalysts in renewable energy systems. Due to the fundamental advantages of POMs, such as the diversity of molecular structures and large numbers of redox active sites, numerous efforts have been devoted to extending their application areas. Up to now, various strategies of assembling POM molecules into superstructures, supporting POMs on heterogeneous substrates, and POMs&#8208;derived metal compounds have been developed for synthesizing electrocatalysts. From a multidisciplinary perspective, the latest advances in creating POM&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals, electrocatalytic roles, and the recent breakthroughs of POMs and POM&#8208;derived electrocatalysts, are systematically summarized. Notably, this paper focuses on exposing the current states, essences, and mechanisms of how POM&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities and discloses the critical requirements for future developments. The future challenges, objectives, comparisons, and perspectives for creating POM&#8208;structured materials are also systematically discussed. It is anticipated that this review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating interdisciplinary efforts for the prosperities and widespread utilizations of POM&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Photoannealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in a Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical translation of engineered tissues is currently hindered by the lack of solutions to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks in clinically sized tissues. Photoannealing of living microtissues combines the clinically translatable microtissue production throughput of in&#8208;air microfluidics with cytocompatible photoannealing to on&#8208;demand generate living microporous tissues containing high&#8208;density capillary networks in a scalable manner.








Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. Here, photoannealing of living microtissue (PALM) is presented as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics is used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultrahigh throughput, which can be photoannealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultrahigh throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Ultraflexible Wireless Imager Integrated with Organic Circuits for Broadband Infrared Thermal Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultraflexible imager incorporating carbon nanotube photodetectors and organic circuits is developed for infrared imaging. This imager, which employs an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix, exhibits high sensitivity to broadband infrared light. The functionality of the imaging system is verified through its application in thermal imaging, confirming that it facilitates the analysis of heat sources, biological movements, and in&#8208;liquid glucose.








Abstract
Flexible imagers are currently under intensive development as versatile optical sensor arrays, designed to capture images of surfaces and internals, irrespective of their shape. A significant challenge in developing flexible imagers is extending their detection capabilities to encompass a broad spectrum of infrared light, particularly terahertz (THz) light at room temperature. This advancement is crucial for thermal and biochemical applications. In this study, a flexible infrared imager is designed using uncooled carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors and organic circuits. The CNT sensors, fabricated on ultrathin 2.4&#160;&#181;m substrates, demonstrate enhanced sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to THz wavelengths. Moreover, they retain their characteristics under bending and crumpling. The design incorporates light&#8208;shielded organic transistors and circuits, functioning reliably under light irradiation, and amplifies THz detection signals by a factor of 10. The integration of both CNT sensors and shielded organic transistors into an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix within the imager enables sequential infrared imaging and nondestructive assessment for heat sources and in&#8208;liquid chemicals through wireless communication systems. The proposed imager, offering unique functionality, shows promise for applications in biochemical analysis and soft robotics.

         <title>Why the Synthesis Affects Performance of Layered Transition Metal Oxide Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO2 or NCM) is the most widely used cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries; so, it is crucial to deeply understand the relationship among synthesis, structure, and performance. However, the present understanding of the structural evolution process remains incomplete. Strictly speaking, synthesis determines structure, structure determines performance, and the material's structure plays a significant role.








Abstract
The limited cyclability of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO2) cathode materials poses a significant challenge to the industrialization of batteries incorporating these materials. This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li+ migration. In addition, the presence of synthesis&#8208;induced heterogeneous phases and lattice defects cannot be disregarded as they also contribute to the degradation in performance. Therefore, gaining a profound understanding of the intricate relationship among material synthesis, structure, and performance is imperative for the development of LiTMO2. This paper highlights the pivotal role of structural play in LiTMO2 materials and provides a comprehensive overview of how various control factors influence the specific pathways of structural evolution during the synthesis process. In addition, it summarizes the scientific challenges associated with diverse modification approaches currently employed to address the cyclic failure of materials. The overarching goal is to provide readers with profound insights into the study of LiTMO2.

A new sacrificial layer, Sr4Al2O7, is proposed to fabricate freestanding oxide membranes with high water dissolution rate, which is &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely attributed to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in its crystal structure.








Abstract
Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes have drawn great attention recently since they offer exceptional structural tunability and stacking ability, providing new opportunities in fundamental research and potential device applications in silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technology. Among different types of sacrificial layers, the (Ca, Sr, Ba)3Al2O6 compounds are most widely used since they can be dissolved in water and prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite oxide membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces; However, the typical transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter&#8208;size freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer&#8208;scale samples with high yield. Here, a new member of the SrO&#8208;Al2O3 family, Sr4Al2O7 is introduced, and its high dissolution rate, &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6 is demonstrated. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely related to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in this compound. This work significantly facilitates the preparation of freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.

         <title>AControl of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in Van Der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although our understanding of the fundamental character of CDW has been enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, we show an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions are observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. Our results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consisted of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. These are influence on the chem&#8208;physic, photophysic and electrical property. Cross&#8208;linked strategy provided an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allow for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent chem&#8208;physic property and substantial improvement in device fabrication. Unsaturated double carbon&#8208;carbon bond (C = C) is a universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, we will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive of overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and chem&#8208;physic property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, we present a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, we offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via cross&#8208;linking strategy.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic and Photovoltaic Performance Arising from Unconventionally Low Donor&#8211;Y6 Ratios</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the use of unconventionally low donor:acceptor ratios of PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 blends for enhanced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance. Inclusion of the donor in nanoparticle suspensions or solid&#8208;state films at low donor mass ratios provide a novel method of reducing the rate of charge recombination in Y6, leading to high performance.








Abstract
Development of both organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic photocatalysts has focused on utilizing the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The BHJ promotes charge separation and enhances the carrier lifetime, but may give rise to increased charge traps, hindering performance. Here, high photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is displayed by electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) nanoparticles (NPs) and films, using the nonfullerene acceptor Y6 and polymer donor PIDT&#8208;T8BT. In contrast to conventional D&#8211;A systems, the charge generation in PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 NPs is mainly driven by Y6, allowing a high performance even at a low D:A mass ratio of 1:50. The high performance at the low mass ratio is attributed to the amorphous behavior of PIDT&#8208;T8BT. Low ratios are generally thought to yield lower efficiency than the more conventional &#8776;1:1 ratio. However, the OPVs exhibit peak performance at a D:A ratio of 1:5. Similarly the NPs used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution show peak performance at the 1:6.7 D:A ratio. Interestingly, for the PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 system, as the polymer proportion increases, a reduced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is observed. The unconventional D:A ratios provide lower recombination losses and increased charge&#8208;carrier lifetime with undisrupted ambipolar charge transport in bulk Y6, enabling better performance than conventional ratios. This work reports novel light&#8208;harvesting materials in which performance is reduced due to unfavorable morphology as D:A ratios move toward conventional ratios of 1:1.2&#8211;1:1.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Mechanical Disruption of &#914;&#8208;Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibers using Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>

Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here we show that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25&#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) particle separation has label&#8208;free, well&#8208;controllable, and low&#8208;damage merits.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectrophoresis (DEP) particle separation has label-free, well-controllable, and low-damage merits. Sidewall microelectrodes made of liquid metal alloy (LMA) inherits the additional advantage of thick electrodes to generate impactful DEP force. However, existing LMA electrode-based devices lack the ability to integrate large-array electrodes in a compact footprint, severely limiting flow rate and thus throughput.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptive Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes against Viruses in the Cold Chain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study prepares FeN4P2 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes) with low&#8208;temperature adaptive OXD&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (4, and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), which efficiently inactivate multiple enveloped viruses by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope; Additionally, under conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment.








Abstract
Outbreaks of viral infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) and influenza A virus (IAV), pose a great threat to human health. Viral spread is accelerated worldwide by the development of cold chain logistics; Therefore, an effective antiviral approach is required. In this study, it is aimed to develop a distinct antiviral strategy using nanozymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability, suitable for cold chain logistics. Phosphorus (P) atoms are added to the remote counter position of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C center to prepare FeN4P2&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), exhibiting lipid oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (&#8722;20, and 4&#160;&#176;C). This feature enables FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes to disrupt multiple enveloped viruses (human, swine, and avian coronaviruses, and H1&#8208;H11 subtypes of IAV) by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope. Under the simulated conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment; Therefore, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability and broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral properties may serve as key materials for developing specific antiviral approaches to interrupt viral transmission through the cold chain.

         <title>Solid Interfaces for the Garnet Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the interior interfaces, garnet/anode, and garnet/cathode interfaces are presented separately. The strategies of Li dendrite suppression, interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations, the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are also summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted extensive interests due to the advantages in developing secondary batteries with high energy density and outstanding safety. Possessing high ionic conductivity and the lowest reduction potential among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SSEs, the garnet type SSE is one of the most promising candidates to achieve high performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). However, the elastic modulus of the garnet electrolyte leads to deteriorated interfacial contacts, and the increasing in electronic conduction at either anode/garnet interface or grain boundary results in Li dendrite growth. Here, recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the strategies of Li dendrite suppression and interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations are presented. A new viewpoint of the double edges of interfacial lithiophobicity is proposed, and the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs are summarized. Moreover, practical roles of the garnet electrolyte in SSLB industry are also discussed. This work delivers insights into the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, which provides not only the promotion of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs, but also a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial stabilization for the whole SSE family.

         <title>Tunable Donor Aggregation Dominance in a Ternary Matrix of All&#8208;Polymer Blends with Improved Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;acceptor strategy in all&#8208;polymer photovoltaic blends pushes the efficiency up to 18.81%, with decent changes in maximal power point (MPP) tracked&#160;and thermal stress applied&#160;stability tests, where a new phenomenon in that donor aggregation is modulated by the acceptor component is focused on and carefully analyzed. The experience of ternary blend design from here is also expected&#160;to be instructive for other organic photovoltaics&#160;systems.








Abstract
Using two structurally similar polymer acceptors in constructing high&#8208;efficiency ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells is a widely acknowledged strategy; however, the focus thus far has not been on how polymer acceptor(s) would tune the aggregation of polymer donors, and furthermore&#160;film morphology and device performance (efficiency and stability). Herein, it is reported that matching of the celebrity acceptor PY&#8208;IT and the donor PBQx&#8208;TCl results in enhanced H&#8208;aggregation in PBQx&#8208;TCl, which can be finely tuned by controlling the amount of the second acceptor PY&#8208;IV. Consequently, the efficiency&#8208;optimized PY&#8208;IV weight ratio (0.2/1.2) leads to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 18.81%, wherein light&#8208;illuminated operational stability is also enhanced along with well&#8208;protected thermal stability. Such enhancements in the efficiency and operational and thermal stabilities of solar cells can be attributed to morphology optimization and the desired glass transition temperature of the target active layer based on comprehensive characterization. In addition to being a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency case for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, these enhancements are also a successful attempt for using combined acceptors to tune donor aggregation toward optimal morphology, which provides a theoretical basis for the construction of other types of organic photovoltaics beyond all&#8208;polymer solar cells.

         <title>The Nanoplasmonic Purcell Effect in Ultrafast and High&#8208;Light&#8208;Yield Perovskite Scintillators</title>

Abstract
The development of X&#8208;ray scintillators with ultrahigh light yields and ultrafast response times is a long sought&#8208;after goal. In this work, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in scintillator devices, this work predicts over 10&#8208;fold enhancement in decay rate and 38% reduction in time resolution even with only a simple planar design. we experimentally demonstrate the nanoplasmonic Purcell effect using perovskite scintillators, enhancing the light yield by over 120% to 88 &#177;$\pm$ 11 ph/keV, and the decay rate by over 60% to 2.0 &#177;$\pm$ 0.2 ns for the average decay time, and 0.7 &#177;$\pm$ 0.1 ns for the ultrafast decay component, in good agreement with the predictions of our theoretical framework. we perform proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept X&#8208;ray imaging experiments using nanoplasmonic scintillators, demonstrating 182% enhancement in the modulation transfer function at 4 line pairs per millimeter spatial frequency. This work highlights the enormous potential of nanoplasmonics in optimizing ultrafast scintillator devices for applications including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight X&#8208;ray imaging and photon&#8208;counting computed tomography.

         <title>Light Management of Metal Halide Scintillators for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

This perspective considers light propagation in metal halide scintillators as the focus. By correlating the reported spatial resolution with light propagation in various forms, this perspective clarifies and deepens the understanding of untouched yet fundamental issues, namely, material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation in metal halide scintillators, and provides the design rules for their future development.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing need to inspect matter with hyperfine structures requires a revolution in current scintillation detectors, and the innovation of scintillators is revived with luminescent metal halides entering the scene. Notably, for any scintillator, two fundamental issues arise: Which kind of material is suitable and in what form should the material exist? The answer to the former question involves the sequence of certain atoms into specific crystal structures that facilitate the conversion of X&#8208;ray into light, whereas the answer to the latter involves assembling these crystallites into particular material forms that can guide light propagation toward its corresponding pixel detector. Despite their equal importance, efforts are overwhelmingly devoted to improving the X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion, while the material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation, which determines the optical signal collected for X&#8208;ray imaging, is largely overlooked. This perspective critically correlates the reported spatial resolution with the light&#8208;propagation behavior in each form of metal halides, combing the designing rules for their future development.

         <title>The Construction of Binary Phase Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triethyl phosphate (TEP)/H2O binary phase electrolyte (BPE) interface is constructed by introducing TEP&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;wetted hydrophobic polypropylene&#160;separator onto the Zn anode surfaces. BPE interface will induce a Zn2+ solvation structure conversion and the most solvated H2O molecules in Zn2+ solvation structure are removed. Consequently, hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;products are effectively restricted on Zn anode surfaces in BPE.








Abstract
Metal zinc is a promising anode candidate of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries due to high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, it often suffers from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), dendrite growth, and formation of by&#8208;products. Herein, a triethyl phosphate (TEP)/H2O binary phase electrolyte (BPE) interface is developed by introducing TEP&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;wetted hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) separator onto the Zn anode surface. The equilibrium of the BPE interface depends on the comparable surface tensions of H2O&#8208;based and TEP&#8208;based electrolytes on hydrophobic PP separator surfaces. The BPE interface induces Zn2+ solvation structure conversion from [Zn(H2O)x]2+ to [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, where most solvated H2O molecules are removed. In [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, the residual H2O molecules can be further constrained by the formation of H bonds between TEP and H2O molecules. Consequently, the ionization of solvated H2O molecules is effectively suppressed, and HER and by&#8208;products are effectively restricted on Zn anode surfaces in BPE. As a result, Zn anodes exhibit a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.12% and superior cycling performance of 6000&#160;h, which is much higher than the case in single&#8208;phase aqueous electrolytes. To illustrate the feasibility of BPE in full cells, the Zn/AlxV2O5 batteries are assembled based on the BPE and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>The Role of Optical Phonon Confinement in the Infrared Dielectric Response of III&#8211;V Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical phonons are known to become confined when the size of the host crystal approaches atomic limits. This confinement offers a unique yet underexplored pathway toward the modification and design of optical phonons in tailored atomic&#8208;scale devices. This study sheds light on the criteria for, and ramifications of phonon confinement, paving the way for designer phonon applications.








Abstract
Polar dielectrics are key materials of interest for infrared (IR) nanophotonic applications due to their ability to host phonon&#8208;polaritons that allow for low&#8208;loss, subdiffractional control of light. The properties of phonon&#8208;polaritons are limited by the characteristics of optical phonons, which are nominally fixed for most &#8220;bulk&#8221; materials. Superlattices composed of alternating atomically thin materials offer control over crystal anisotropy through changes in composition, optical phonon confinement, and the emergence of new modes. In particular, the modified optical phonons in superlattices offer the potential for so&#8208;called crystalline hybrids whose IR properties cannot be described as a simple mixture of the bulk constituents. To date, however, studies have primarily focused on identifying the presence of new or modified optical phonon modes rather than assessing their impact on the IR response. This study focuses on assessing the impact of confined optical phonon modes on the hybrid IR dielectric function in superlattices of GaSb and AlSb. Using a combination of first principles theory, Raman, FTIR, and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the hybrid dielectric function is found to track the confinement of optical phonons, leading to optical phonon spectral shifts of up to 20 cm&#8722;1. These results provide an alternative pathway toward designer IR optical materials.

         <title>Near&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Scale Perspective on the Oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Insights from Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes, atom probe tomography (APT) reveals that alkalis concentrate in TiO2 nanowires, indicating that their presence influences the oxidation mechanisms and kinetics. These results highlight how APT can be utilized to better understand the functional surface terminations, intercalated ions, or impurities that are inevitable in the wet chemical synthesis of MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with remarkable properties, bearing great potential for energy storage and catalysis applications. However, their oxidation behavior is not yet fully understood, and there are still open questions regarding the spatial distribution and precise quantification of surface terminations, intercalated ions, and possible uncontrolled impurities incorporated during synthesis and processing. Here, atom probe tomography (APT) analysis of as&#8208;synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXenes reveals the presence of alkali (Li, Na) and halogen (Cl, F) elements as well as unetched Al. Following oxidation of the colloidal solution of MXenes, it is observed that the alkalis are enriched in TiO2 nanowires. Although these elements are tolerated through the incorporation by wet chemical synthesis, they are often overlooked when the activity of these materials is considered, particularly during catalytic testing. This work demonstrates how the capability of APT to image these elements in 3D at the near&#8208;atomic scale can help to better understand the activity and degradation of MXenes, in order to guide their synthesis for superior functional&#160;properties.

         <title>Anisotropic Superconducting Nb2CTx MXene Processed by Atomic Exchange at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting Nb2CTx MXenes is realized through nitrogen doping in an atomic&#8208;exchange process. This is the first time to investigate MXene superconductivity at nanoscale based either on the single&#8208;flake or thin film. The anisotropic 2D superconductivity is successfully uncovered. Besides, processing the superconducting thin film over a 4 in. wafer opens up a space for scalable MXene&#8208;based superconducting devices.








Abstract
Superconductivty has recently been induced in MXenes through surface modification.

         <title>Heterointerface Design of Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution epitaxial growth strategy is proposed to grow high&#8208;quality perovskite single crystal heterojunction with designable heterointerface width. The single crystals possess low dark current and ion migration due to their high energy&#8208;band barrier at the space charge region. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the single crystals exhibit stable, high sensitivity, low detection limit, and high spatial resolution during X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals (MHP&#8208;SCs) are known for their facile fabrication into large sizes using inexpensive solution methods. Owing to their combination of large mobility&#8208;lifetime products and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, they are considered promising materials for efficient X&#8208;ray detection. However, they suffer from large dark currents and severe ion migration, which limit their sensitivity and stability in critical X&#8208;ray detection applications. Herein, a heterointerface design is proposed to reduce both the dark current and ion migration by forming a heterojunction. In addition, the carrier transport performance is significantly improved using heterointerface engineering by designing a gradient band structure in the SCs. The SC heterojunction detectors exhibit a high sensitivity of 3.98 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a low detection limit of 12.2 nGyair s&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of 10.2 lp mm&#8722;1 during imaging. These values are among the highest reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MHP X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the detectors show excellent stability under continuous X&#8208;ray irradiation and maintainclear X&#8208;ray imaging after 240 d. This study provides novel insights into the design and fabrication of X&#8208;ray detectors with high detection efficiency and stability, which are beneficial for developing inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging equipment.

         <title>Highly Reliable Van Der Waals Memory Boosted by a Single 2D Charge Trap Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PbI2 is a unique 2D charge trap medium to offer atomically smooth interfaces, uniformly distributed traps and high&#8208;integration feasibility for reliable memories and artificial synapses. The spontaneously formed iodine vacancies in PbI2 cause the charge trapping/releasing in 2D semiconducting channel such as MoS2, WS2, and WSe2, leading to the significantly better comprehensive performance compared to previous 2D charge trap memories.








Abstract
Charge trap materials that can store carriers efficiently and controllably are desired for memory applications. 2D materials are promising for highly compacted and reliable memory mainly due to their ease of constructing atomically uniform interfaces, however, remain unexplored as being charge trap media. Here it is discovered that 2D semiconducting PbI2 is an excellent charge trap material for nonvolatile memory and artificial synapses. It is simple to construct PbI2&#8208;based charge trap devices since no complicated synthesis or additional defect manufacturing are required. As a demonstration, MoS2/PbI2 device exhibits a large memory window of 120&#160;V, fast write speed of 5 &#181;s, high on&#8208;off ratio around 106, multilevel memory of over 8 distinct states, high reliability with endurance up to 104 cycles and retention over 1.2 &#215; 104 s. It is envisioned that PbI2 with ionic activity caused by the natively formed iodine vacancies is unique to combine with unlimited 2D materials for versatile van der Waals devices with high&#8208;integration and multifunctionality.

         <title>Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic solvent exchange process within the silica nanoparticles is monitored with millisecond time resolution by embedding rotor&#8208;based fluorophores in the silica matrix. The additional validations is further demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy for investigating nanoscale transport diffusion in micropores.








Abstract
Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non&#8208;fluorescent and non&#8208;reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor&#8208;based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces can be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process, and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross&#8208;linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165&#160;nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Responsive Breathing Transition of Conductive Hydrogel for Broadband Kinetic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive hydrogel, engineered with a PEDOT:PSS network featuring dynamic crosslinking points, exhibits electro&#8208;responsive behavior for efficient energy storage. The high&#8208;density charge surfaces enable breathing transitions under voltage, offering superior frequency compatibility. The flexible energy harvester based on such hydrogel reclaims kinetic energy, suggesting topological&#8208;structure engineering of hydrogels as a promising route for ambient energy management.








Abstract
Reclaiming kinetic energy from vibrating machines holds great promise for sustainable energy harvesting technologies. Nevertheless, the impulsive current induced by vibrations is incompatible with conventional energy storage devices. The energy&#8208;management system necessitates novel designs of soft materials for lightweight, miniaturized, and integrated high&#8208;frequency electrochemical devices. Here, this work develops a conductive hydrogel with an electro&#8208;responsive polymeric network. The electro&#8208;responsive breathing transition of the crosslinking points facilitates the expeditious formation of a localized electrolyte layer. This layer features an exceedingly high local charge density, surpassing that of a saturated electrolyte solution by an order of magnitude, and thus enabling rapid charge transport under the influence of an applied voltage. The micro&#8208;capacitor based on the gel exhibits record&#8208;high capacitance of &#8776;2 mF cm&#8722;2 when the frequency of energy input reaches up to 104&#160;Hz. This work also demonstrates a prototype battery charger that harvests energy from a running car engine. This study presents a feasible strategy for waste energy recycling using integrated electrochemical devices, opening a new avenue for ambient energy management.

         <title>Labile Coordination Interphase for Regulating Lean Ion Dynamics in Reversible Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CA zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase that protects zinc anodes from chemical corrosion is developed. Zn2+ ions selectively bind to histidine and carboxylate ligands, creating a coordination environment with high affinity and fast diffusion due to thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This labile coordination interphase improves cycling with dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping reversibility, leading to high&#8208;energy lean&#8208;electrolyte zinc ion batteries with long cycling life.








Abstract
Rechargeability in zinc (Zn) batteries is limited by anode irreversibility. The practical lean electrolytes exacerbate the issue, compromising the cost benefits of zinc batteries for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In this study, a zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase is developed to avoid chemical corrosion and stabilize zinc anodes. The interphase promotes Zn2+ ions to selectively bind with histidine and carboxylate ligands, creating a coordination environment with high affinity and fast diffusion due to thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. Experiments and simulations indicate that interphase regulates dendrite&#8208;free electrodeposition and reduces side reactions. Implementing such labile coordination interphase results in increased cycling at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 and high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for over 200 hours. A Zn||LiMn2O4 cell with 74.7 mWh g&#8722;1 energy density and 99.7% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles realized enhanced reversibility using the labile coordination interphase. A lean&#8208;electrolyte full cell using only 10 &#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolyte is also demonstrated with an elongated lifespan of 100 cycles, five times longer than bare Zn anodes. The cell offers a higher energy density than most existing aqueous batteries. This study presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design for low&#8208;electrolyte, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries by modulating coordination interphases on Zn anodes.

         <title>Instant Protection Spray for Anti&#8208;Infection and Accelerated Healing of Empyrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An instant protection spray based on an angle layout can form a hydrogel film on burns in 30 s. The spray&#8208;loaded microparticles formed from probiotic extracts and flavones can provide a physical and anti&#8208;infection barrier for burns and promote healing, together with the hydrogel film.








Abstract
Distinct from common injuries, deep burns often require a chronic recovery cycle for healing and long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment to prevent infection. The rise of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has caused antibiotics to no longer be perfect, and continuous drug use can easily lead to repeated infection and even death. Inspired by wild animals that chew plants to prevent wound infection, probiotic extracts with a structure similar to the tailspike of phage are obtained from Lactobacillus casei and combined with different flavones to design a series of nonantibiotic bactericides. These novel antibacterial agents are combined with a rapid gelation spray with a novel cross&#8208;angle layout to form an instant protection spray (IPS) and provide a physical and anti&#8208;infectious barrier for burns within 30 s. This IPS is able to sterilize 100.00% and 96.14% of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it is found to effectively reduce inflammation in MRSA&#8208;infected burns in rats and to promote tissue healing.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Multicatalytic Synergistic Transformation: toward Environmentally Adaptable Organohydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicatalytic synergistic chemical transformation is a highly efficient and imperative approach for engineering gels in a sustainable way. Through Lignin aluminum nanoparticles (AlNPs)&#8208;aluminum ions (Al3+) catalytic system, a sustainable, environmentally adaptable, flame&#8208;retardant, conductive, self&#8208;healing, and multifaceted organohydrogel is engineered. The organohydrogel concurrently combines the advantages of both hydrogels and organogels, broadening the scope and applications of the gel&#8208;system into a wide range of industries.








Abstract
A sustainable and efficient multicatalytic chemical transformation approach is devised for the development of all&#8208;biobased environmentally adaptable polymers and gels with multifunctional properties. The catalytic system, utilizing Lignin aluminum nanoparticles (AlNPs)&#8208;aluminum ions (Al3+), synergistically combines multiple catalytic cycles to create robust, mechanically stable, and versatile organohydrogels. Single catalytic cycles alone fail to achieve desired results, highlighting the importance of cooperatively combining different cycles for successful outcomes. The transformation involves free radical crosslinking, reversible quinone&#8208;catechol reactions, and an autocatalytic mechanism, resulting in a dual crosslinking strategy that incorporates both covalent and ionic crosslinking. This approach creates a dynamic gel system with combined energy dissipation and storage mechanisms. The engineered organohydrogels demonstrate vital multifunctionalities such as good thermal stability, self&#8208;healing, and adhesive properties, flame&#8208;retardancy, mechanical resilience and durability, conductivity, viscoelastic properties, environmental adaptability, and resistance to extreme conditions such as freezing and drying. The developed catalytic technology and resulting gels hold significant potential for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, actuators, and sensors.

         <title>Inhibiting Endothelial Cell&#8208;Mediated T Lymphocyte Apoptosis with Integrin&#8208;Targeting Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Filaments for Chemoimmunotherapy of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>

SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR nanofibers simultaneously induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and downregulate Fas ligand expression on tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs). The treatment promotes antitumor immunity and reduces TEC&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell apoptosis, significantly inhibiting the growth of primary TNBC tumors and pulmonary metastasis.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs) limit antitumor immunity via inducing apoptosis of infiltrating T lymphocytes through a Fas ligand (FasL) mediated mechanism. Herein, this work creates a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) by linking 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) to hydrophilic segments with either RGDR or HKD motif at their C&#8208;terminus through a glutathione&#8208;responsive linker. The PDCs spontaneously assemble into filaments in aqueous solution. The PDC filaments containing 1% of SN38&#8208;RGDR (SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR) effectively target triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and TECs with upregulated expression of integrin, and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and FasL downregulation of TECs. SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR increases infiltration, activity, and viability of CD8+ T cells, and thus inhibits the growth of primary tumors and pulmonary metastasis. This study highlights the synergistic modulation of cancerous cells and TECs with integrin&#8208;targeting PDC filaments as a promising strategy for TNBC chemoimmunotherapy.

         <title>A Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Bio&#8208;Macromolecule Film for Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly method is deployed to deposit a robust dual&#8208;polymer layer on zinc anode, which effectively smoothens out the pristine rough surface of zinc foil, and also buffers the volume change caused by Zn plating/stripping. Four LbL layers are found the best, which significantly diminish zinc dendrite growth and elongate the cycle life of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIB) up to 14 000 cycles.








Abstract
Side reactions on zinc metal (Zn) anodes are formidable issues that cause limited battery life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, a facile and controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly technique is deployed to construct an ion&#8208;conductive and mechanically robust electrolyte/anode interface for stabilizing the Zn anode. The LbL film consists of two natural and biodegradable bio&#8208;macromolecules, chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA). It is shown that such an LbL film tailors the solvation sheath of Zn ions and facilitates the oriented deposition of Zn. Symmetric cells with the four double layers of CS/SA ((CS/SA)4&#8211;Zn) exhibit stable cycles for over 6500&#160;h. The (CS/SA)4&#8211;Zn||H2V3O8 coin cell maintains a specific capacity of 125.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 14&#160;000 cycles. The pouch cell with an electrode area of 5 &#215; 7 cm2 also presents a capacity retention of 83% for over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. No obvious dendrites are observed after long cycles in both symmetric and full cells. Given the cost&#8208;effective material and fabrication, and environmental friendliness of the LbL films, this Zn protection strategy may boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method is deployed to deposit a robust dual-polymer layer on zinc anode, which effectively smoothens out the pristine rough surface of zinc foil, and also buffers the volume change caused by Zn plating/stripping. Four LbL layers are found the best, which significantly diminish zinc dendrite growth and elongate the cycle life of zinc-ion batteries (ZIB) up to 14 000 cycles.

         <title>A Transformable Supramolecular Bispecific Cell Engager for Augmenting Natural Killer and T Cell&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular bispecific&#8208;cell&#8208;engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) that simultaneously targets TIGIT on NK/T cells and PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells is fabricated by co&#8208;assembly of two immune checkpoint blocking peptides. Supra&#8208;BiCE creates artificial connections between NK/T cells with tumor cells as well as blocking both check points, thus increasing infiltration and activation of NK and T cells at tumor site and boosting tumor inhibition rate.








Abstract
Immune cells are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy, yet their therapeutic effectiveness is often hampered by limited tumor infiltration and inhibitory tumor microenvironments. An alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive and transformable supramolecular bis&#8208;specific cell engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) to harness natural killer (NK)/T cells for effective cancer immunotherapy is introduced here. The Supra&#8208;BiCE, consisting of both SA&#8208;P (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)) and SA&#8208;T (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT)) is constructed by a simple co&#8208;assembling strategy. Upon intravenous administration, Supra&#8208;BiCE self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons and interacts with NK/T cells via TIGIT. Notably, these nanoribbons undergo transformation into long nanofibrils within ALP&#8208;overexpressing tumor regions, resulting in enhanced binding affinities of Supra&#8208;BiCE to both PD&#8208;L1 and TIGIT. Consequently, this leads to the accumulation and retention of NK/T cells within tumor regions. Furthermore, the combinatorial blockade of checkpoints by Supra&#8208;BiCE activates infiltrating NK/T cells. Moreover, the adjustable peptide ratio in Supra&#8208;BiCE enables customization for optimal therapeutic effects against distinct tumor types. Particularly, Supra&#8208;BiCE (T:P = 1:3) achieved 98.27% tumor suppression rate against colon carcinoma model. Overall, this study offers a promising tool for engaging NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Photocatalyst to Optimize Hydroxyl Radical Production Pathways for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>

Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks with metal single&#8208;atom coordination (Pd2+@Tp&#8208;TAPT) with high yield of &#8226;OH through an optimal conversion way has high activity in photodegradation of phenolic pollutants (10&#160;ppm phenol within 10&#160;min) and high selectivity in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation (189.63&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NH4+), which provides guidance for the application of photocatalytic technology in environmental remediation and energy storage.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening of phenol in wastewater is the pivotal step in photocatalytic degradation. The highly selective generation of catalytical active species (&#8226;OH) to facilitate this process presents a significant scientific challenge. Therefore, a novel approach for designing photocatalysts with single&#8208;atom containment in metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) is proposed. The selection of imine&#8208;linked COFs containing abundant N and O&#8208;chelate sites provides a solid foundation for anchoring metal atom. These dispersed metal atom possess rapid accumulation and transfer capabilities for photogenerated electrons, while the periodic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure in 2D&#8208;COFs establishes an effective platform. Additionally, the Lewis acid properties of imine bonds in COFs can enhance the adsorption capacity toward gases with Lewis base properties, such as O2 and N2. It is demonstrated that the Pd2+@Tp&#8208;TAPT, designed based on this concept, exhibits efficient oxygen adsorption and follows the reaction pathway of O2&#8594;&#8226;O2&#8722;&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH with high selectivity, thereby achieving completely degradation of refractory phenol through photocatalysis within 10 min. It is anticipated that the selective generation of catalytic active species via advanced material design concepts will serve as a significant reference for achieving precise material catalysis in the future.

         <title>Ultrasound Nanobubble Coupling Agent for Effective Noninvasive Deep&#8208;Layer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound nanobubbles and aminated hyaluronic acid prepared by the double emulsification method are crosslinked with aldehyde&#8208;based hyaluronic acid via dynamic covalent bonds through the Schiff base reaction to produce an innovative ultrasound&#8211;nanobubble coupling agent. By amplifying the cavitation effect of ultrasound, drugs can be efficiently transferred through the double barrier of the skin and delivered to deep layers.








Abstract
Conventional coupling agents (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, and polyurethane) are unable to efficiently transport drugs through the skin's dual barriers (the epidermal cuticle barrier and the basement membrane barrier between the epidermis and dermis) when exposed to ultrasound, hindering deep and noninvasive transdermal drug delivery. In this study, nanobubbles prepared by the double emulsification method and aminated hyaluronic acid are crosslinked with aldehyde&#8208;based hyaluronic acid by dynamic covalent bonding through the Schiff base reaction to produce an innovative ultrasound&#8208;nanobubble coupling agent. By amplifying the cavitation effect of ultrasound, drugs can be efficiently transferred through the double barrier of the skin and delivered to deep layers. In an in vitro model of isolated porcine skin, this agent achieves an effective penetration depth of 728&#160;&#181;m with the parameters of ultrasound set at 2&#160;W, 650&#160;kHz, and 50% duty cycle for 20&#160;min. Consequently, drugs can be efficiently delivered to deeper layers noninvasively. In summary, this ultrasound nanobubble coupling agent efficiently achieves deep&#8208;layer drug delivery by amplifying the ultrasonic cavitation effect and penetrating the double barriers, heralding a new era for noninvasive drug delivery platforms and disease treatment.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching of Electrochromic Polymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous chiral electrochromics using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers have been developed through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. The circular dichroism can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see&#8208;through display can make a well&#8208;resolved color change, demonstrating proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices for information encryption.








Abstract
The interaction between light and chiroptical polymers plays a crucial role in chiroptics, spintronics, and chiral&#8208;spin selectivity. Despite considerable successes in creating dissymmetric polymer films, the elucidation of chiroptical activities under electrochemical switching remains unexplored. Here homogeneous chiral electrochromics is reported using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. In their neutral state, the chiral electrochromic polymers directly produce a remarkably dissymmetric polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance. The circular dichroism (CD) and dissymmetric transmission can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. Under high levels of oxidation, the chiroptical activities are reversed with strong bleaching in the visible, leading to formation of monosignate CD spectra over the infrared region.

&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous chiral electrochromics using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers have been developed through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. The circular dichroism can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see-through display can make a well-resolved color change, demonstrating proof-of-concept devices for information encryption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction between light and chiroptical polymers plays a crucial role in chiroptics, spintronics, and chiral-spin selectivity. Despite considerable successes in creating dissymmetric polymer films, the elucidation of chiroptical activities under electrochemical switching remains unexplored. Here homogeneous chiral electrochromics is reported using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. In their neutral state, the chiral electrochromic polymers directly produce a remarkably dissymmetric polarization-dependent transmittance. The circular dichroism (CD) and dissymmetric transmission can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. Under high levels of oxidation, the chiroptical activities are reversed with strong bleaching in the visible, leading to formation of monosignate CD spectra over the infrared region. The matching between circular polarization handedness and chirality of chiroptical polymers makes a distinct impact on optical contrast and color switching dynamics due to the flipped chiroptical activities through polymer redox reactions. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see-through display can make a well-resolved color change in human eyes, demonstrating proof-of-concept devices for 3D imaging and information encryption. This work serves as a foundation to develop advanced on-chip fabrication of circular polarization-multiplexed display in flexible and highly integrated platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tunable Soft Silicone Bioadhesive for Secure Anchoring of Diverse Medical Devices to Wet Biological Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicone&#8208;based bioadhesive designed to create strong bonds between silicone devices and biological tissues is presented here. It combines wet tissue adhesion with long&#8208;term integration, transitioning from nonpermeable to permeable over time to facilitate cell migration. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to commercial adhesives, with no adverse reactions observed in rats, promising versatile applications in medical device adhesion.








Abstract
Silicone is utilized widely in medical devices for its compatibility with tissues and bodily fluids, making it a versatile material for implants and wearables. To effectively bond silicone devices to biological tissues, a reliable adhesive is required to create a long&#8208;lasting interface. BioAdheSil, a silicone&#8208;based bioadhesive designed to provide robust adhesion on both sides of the interface is introduced here, facilitating bonding between dissimilar substrates, namely silicone devices and tissues. The adhesive's design focuses on two key aspects: wet tissue adhesion capability and tissue&#8208;infiltration&#8208;based long&#8208;term integration. BioAdheSil is formulated by mixing soft silicone oligomers with siloxane coupling agents and absorbents for bonding the hydrophobic silicone device to hydrophilic tissues. Incorporation of biodegradable absorbents eliminates surface water and controls porosity, while silane crosslinkers provide interfacial strength. Over time, BioAdheSil transitions from nonpermeable to permeable through enzyme degradation, creating a porous structure that facilitates cell migration and tissue integration, potentially enabling long&#8208;lasting adhesion. Experimental results demonstrate that BioAdheSil outperforms commercial adhesives and elicits no adverse response in rats. BioAdheSil offers practical utility for adhering silicone devices to wet tissues, including long&#8208;term implants and transcutaneous devices. Here, its functionality is demonstrated through applications such as tracheal stents and left ventricular assist device lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Sulfur Loading and Single Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes for High&#8208;Energy and Durable Decoupled Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;membrane decoupled aqueous Zn&#8211;S battery is achieved by decoupling the S/Cu2S cathode and Zn/Zn(OH)42&#8722; anode, which presents an energy density of 3988 Wh kgs&#8722;1 (based on sulfur mass). The high areal energy density and long operational life originate from the high&#8208;sulfur loading cathode and newly designed single ion&#8208;selective membrane.








Abstract
The decoupled battery design is promising for breaking the energy density limit of traditional aqueous batteries. However, the complex battery configuration and low&#8208;selective separator membranes restrict their energy output and service time. Herein, a zinc&#8211;sulfur decoupled aqueous battery is achieved by designing a high&#8208;mass loading sulfur electrode and single ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM). A vertically assembled nanosheet network constructed with the assistance of a magnetic field enables facile electron and ion conduction in thick sulfur electrodes, which is conducive to boosting the cell&#8208;level energy output. For the tailored ISM, the Na ions anchored on its skeleton effectively prevent the crossover of OH&#8722; or Cu2+, facilitating the transport of Na+ and ensuring structural and mechanical stability. Consequently, the Zn&#8211;S aqueous battery achieves a reversible energy density of 3988&#160;Wh kgs&#8722;1 (by sulfur mass), stable operation over 300 cycles, and an energy density of 53.2 mWh cm&#8722;2. The sulfur&#8208;based decoupled system may be of immediate benefit toward safe, reliable, and affordable static energy storage.

         <title>Universal Stripe Symmetry of Short&#8208;Range Charge Density Waves in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) in copper&#8208;oxide superconductors is an important clue for the longstanding conundrum of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. This novel RIXS mapping study corroborates unidirectional stripe as a fundamental symmetry of CDWs across cuprate materials. This remarkable universality provides a new perspective on the unified organizing principle of CDW and its role in the phase diagram of copper&#8208;oxide superconductors.








Abstract
The omnipresence of charge density waves (CDWs) across almost all cuprate families underpins a common organizing principle. However, a longstanding debate of whether its spatial symmetry is stripe or checkerboard remains unresolved. While CDWs in lanthanum&#8208; and yttrium&#8208;based cuprates possess a stripe symmetry, distinguishing these two scenarios is challenging for the short&#8208;range CDW in bismuth&#8208;based cuprates. Here, high&#8208;resolution resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering is employed to uncover the spatial symmetry of the CDW in Bi2Sr2 &#8722; xLaxCuO6 + &#948;. Across a wide range of doping and temperature, anisotropic CDW peaks with elliptical shapes are found in reciprocal space. Based on Fourier transform analysis of real&#8208;space models, the results are interpreted as evidence of unidirectional charge stripes, hosted by mutually 90&#176;&#8208;rotated anisotropic domains. This work paves the way for a unified symmetry and microscopic description of CDW order in&#160;cuprates.

         <title>Polymer Coating with Balanced Coordination Strength and Ion Conductivity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) limits the unrestricted 2D diffusion of zinc ions through soft coordination and the partially quaternized derivative (q&#8208;P2VP) further enables a balance between coordination trapping and ion transporting, leading to a rapid ion migration speed and a lower capacity decay.








Abstract
Decorating Zn anodes with functionalized polymers is considered as an effective strategy to inhibit dendrite growth. However, this normally brings extra interfacial resistance rendering slow reaction kinetics of Zn2+. Herein, a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) coating with modulated coordination strength and ion conductivity for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode is reported. The P2VP coating favors a high electrolyte wettability and rapid Zn2+ migration speed (Zn2+ transfer number, tZn2+ = 0.58). Electrostatic potential calculation shows that P2VP mildly coordinates with Zn2+ (adsorption energy = &#8722;0.94&#160;eV), which promotes a preferential deposition of Zn along the (002) crystal plane. Notably, the use of partially (26%) quaternized P2VP (q&#8208;P2VP) further reduces the interfacial resistance to 126 &#937;, leading to a high ion migration speed (tZn2+ = 0.78) and a considerably low nucleation overpotential (18&#160;mV). As a result of the synergistic effect of mild coordination and partial electrolysis, the overpotential of the q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;decorated Zn anode retains at a considerably low level (&#8776;46&#160;mV) over 1000&#160;h at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.5H2O || glass fiber || q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;Zn full cell reveals a lower average capacity decay rate of only 0.018% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Synergistic Pharmacological Therapy to Modulate Glial Cells in Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, a nanogel that can selectively release active compounds in microglial cells and astrocytes in the spinal cord is developed and evaluated using expansion microscopy. Two administration schemes are tested in a spinal cord injury mouse model. Early treatment with Rolipram&#8208;loaded nanogel improves motor performance; late phase treatment has the opposite effect, worsening motor recovery due to widespread degeneration.








Abstract
Current treatments for modulating the glial&#8208;mediated inflammatory response after spinal cord injury (SCI) have limited ability to improve recovery. This is quite likely due to the lack of a selective therapeutic approach acting on microgliosis and astrocytosis, the glia components most involved after trauma, while maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects. A new nanogel that can selectively release active compounds in microglial cells and astrocytes is developed and characterized. The degree of selectivity and subcellular distribution of the nanogel is evaluated by applying an innovative super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique, expansion microscopy. Two different administration schemes are then tested in a SCI mouse model: in an early phase, the nanogel loaded with Rolipram, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, achieves significant improvement in the animal's motor performance due to the increased recruitment of microglia and macrophages that are able to localize the lesion. Treatment in the late phase, however, gives opposite results, with worse motor recovery because of the widespread degeneration. These findings demonstrate that the nanovector can be selective and functional in the treatment of the glial component in different phases of SCI. They also open a new therapeutic scenario for tackling glia&#8208;mediated inflammation after neurodegenerative events in the central nervous system.

         <title>A Dynamically Stable Mixed Conducting Interphase for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by a stress self&#8208;limiting mechanism to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes. The S&#8208;MCI can efficiently reduce Li nucleation overpotential, uniformize Li&#8208;ion flux and promote Li kinetics, leading to the suppression of Li dendrite penetration in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLMBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes have attracted increasing attention owing to superior safety and high energy density. However, the instability of sulfide electrolytes against Li metal induces the formation of two types of incompetent interphases, solid electrolyte&#160;interphase (SEI) and mixed conducting interphase (MCI), which significantly blocks rapid Li&#8208;ion transport and induces uneven Li deposition and continuous interface degradation. In this contribution, a dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by in situ stress self&#8208;limiting reaction to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes (Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)). The rational design of composite electrolytes&#160;utilizes the expansion stress induced by the electrolyte decomposition to in turn constrain the further decomposition of LGPS. Consequently, the S&#8208;MCI inherits the high dynamical stability of LPSCl&#8208;derived SEI and the lithiophilic affinity of Li&#8211;Ge alloy in LGPS&#8208;derived MCI. The Li||Li symmetric cells with the protection of S&#8208;MCI can operate stably for 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||NCM622 full cells present stable cycling for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.7%. This work sheds fresh insight into constructing electrochemically stable interphase for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>Polarization Reversal of Group IV&#8211;VI Semiconductors with Pucker&#8208;Like Structure: Mechanism Dissecting and Function Demonstration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The miniaturized image band identification and enhancement system can be achieved by utilizing a polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector with polarization reversal capability. The photodetector is constructed using in&#8208;plane pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se), leveraging the intrinsic differences in transition probabilities of charge carriers.








Abstract
Polarization imaging presents advantages in capturing spatial, spectral, and polarization information across various spectral bands. It can improve the perceptual ability of image sensors and has garnered more applications. Despite its potential, challenges persist in identifying band information and implementing image enhancement using polarization imaging. These challenges often necessitate integrating spectrometers or other components, resulting in increased complexities within image processing systems and hindering device miniaturization trends. Here, the characteristics of anisotropic absorption reversal are systematically elucidated in pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se) through theoretical predictions and experimental validations. Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms behind anisotropy reversal in different bands are also explored. The photodetector is constructed by utilizing MX as a light&#8208;absorbing layer, harnessing polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse for virtual imaging. The results indicate that the utilization of polarization reversal photodetectors holds advantages in achieving further multifunctional integration within the device structure while simplifying its configuration, including band information identification and image enhancement. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of polarization reversal mechanisms and presents a promising and reliable approach for achieving dual&#8208;band image band identification and image enhancement without additional auxiliary components.

         <title>The One&#8208;Stop Integrated Nanoagent Based on Photothermal Therapy for Deep Infection Healing and Inflammation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs are designed and fabricated to eliminate bacterial biofilms and facilitate the MRSA&#8208;infected abscess wound healing. The ROS&#8208;scavenging, O2&#8208;producing, and regulation of macrophage polarization mechanisms based on multiple enzymatic activities and the photothermal property are revealed. Herein, a reasonable antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammation approach against infected wounds and a reference for other hypoxia&#8208;relative inflammatory diseases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Chronic wounds caused by bacterial infections are a major challenge in medical fields. The hypoxia condition extremely induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and upregulates the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor, both of which can increase the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 subtype macrophages production while reducing the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype macrophages. Besides, bacteria&#8208;formed biofilms can hinder the penetration of therapeutic agents. Encouraged by natural motors automatically executing tasks, hypothesized that supplying sufficient oxygen (O2) would simultaneously drive therapeutic agent movement, rescue the hypoxic microenvironment, and disrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation. Here, small organic molecule&#8208;based nanoparticles (2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs) that possess high photothermal conversion efficiency and enzymatic activities are developed, including superoxide dismutase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activity. 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs exhibit superior ROS&#8208;scavenging and O2 production abilities that synergistically relieve inflammation, alleviate hypoxia conditions, and promote their deep penetration in chronic wound tissues. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrates that 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs inhibit biological activities inside bacteria. Furthermore, in vivo experiments prove that 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs&#8208;based hyperthermia can effectively eliminate bacteria in biofilms to promote wound healing.

         <title>Intrinsic Polarized Electric Field Induces a Storing Mechanism to Achieve Energy Storing Catalysis in V2C MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
V2C MXene exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;like intrinsic polarization electric field, enabling the storage of internal electrons within the structural layer and holes on its surface while maintaining separation. Achievement of the single&#8208;phase energy storage effect. Surface termination is adjusted to enhance its energy storage capacity. Consequently, it demonstrates effective dark catalysis and full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Efficient storage and separation of holes and electrons pose significant challenges for catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of single&#8208;phase catalysis. Herein, V2C MXene, with its intrinsic polarized electric field, successfully overcomes this obstacle. To enhance hole storage, a multistep etching process is employed under reducing conditions to control the content of surface termination groups, thus exposing more defective active sites. The intrinsically polarized electric field confines holes to the surface of the layer and free electrons within the layer, leading to a lag in e&#8722; release compared to h+. The quantities of stored holes and electrons are measured to be 18.13&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 and 106.37 &#181;mol g&#8722;1, respectively. Under dark, V2C demonstrates excellent and stable dark&#8208;catalytic performance, degrading 57.91% of tetracycline (TC 40&#160;mg L&#8722;1) and removing 23% of total organic carbon (TOC) after 140 min. In simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light, the corresponding degradation rates reach 72.24% and 79.54%, with corresponding TOC removal rates of 49% and 48%, respectively. The hole and electron induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects contribute to a long&#8208;lasting and enhanced broad&#8208;spectrum mineralization of V2C MXene. This study provides valuable insights into the research and application of all&#8208;weather MXene energy storage catalytic materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable ITO&#8208;Free Organic Solar Cells Based on Squaraine N&#8208;Doped Quaternary Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A squaraine&#8208;based n&#8208;doping strategy is developed to optimize the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based ternary bulk heterojunctions. Combined with indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity architecture and interfacial engineering, an impressive efficiency over 19% is achieved for the resulting quaternary organic solar cells, with an extrapolated lifetime of &#8776;23 years based on accelerated aging test.









Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and robust device stability remains a significant challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs). Solving this challenge is highly dependent on the film morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive blends; however, there is a lack of rational control strategy. Herein, it is shown that the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based BHJ can be effectively controlled by a squaraine&#8208;based doping strategy, leading to an increase in device efficiency from 17.26% to 18.5% when doping 2&#160;wt% squaraine into the PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9:PC71BM ternary BHJ. The efficiency is further improved to 19.11% (certified 19.06%) using an indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity (CPM) architecture. Combined with interfacial modification, CPM quaternary OSC excitingly shows an extrapolated lifetime of &#8776;23 years based on accelerated aging test, with the mechanism behind enhanced stability well studied. Furthermore, a flexible OSC module with a high and stable efficiency of 15.2% and an overall area of 5 cm2 is successfully fabricated, exhibiting a high average output power for wearable electronics. This work demonstrates that OSCs with new design of BHJ and device architecture are highly promising to be practical relevance with excellent performance and stability.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Synchronized ROS Generation and Hypoxia Prodrug Activation with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure Sonosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tirapazamine (TPZ) loaded BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure is designed to efficiently separate electron and hole with high redox potentials. Under ultrasound irradiation, the generated holes react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons activate TPZ, leading to the synergistic sonodynamic and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs therapy, negating the need for O2.








Abstract
Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for effective tumor treatment. However, the combination of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs (HAPs) has not been explored due to the contradictory requirement of oxygen (O2) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the necessity to avoid O2 for the activation of HAPs. In this study, this challenge is addressed by developing BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure nanoparticles loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ) to achieve O2&#8208;independent therapy. These nanoparticles demonstrate efficient electron&#8211;hole separation under ultrasound irradiation while maintaining a high redox potential. The generated holes react with water to efficiently produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons autonomously activate TPZ, negating the need for O2. In vitro and in vivo assessments validate the effective tumor elimination by these Z&#8208;scheme nanoparticles without disrupting the hypoxic environment. This innovative design overcomes the limitations associated with O2 requirement in SDT and introduces a novel strategy for HAP activation and synergistic therapy between ROS and HAPs&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Halide Heterogeneous Structure Boosting Ionic Diffusion and High&#8208;Voltage Stability of Sodium Superionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries heavily hinges on the development of a Na+ conductor that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. In this study, the halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes incorporating a UCl3&#8208;type high&#8208;coordination framework and amorphous low&#8208;coordination phase achieves the high Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, RT) and good solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion battery performance.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of an superionic Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, this work exploits the structural variance between high&#8208; and low&#8208;coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3&#8208;type high&#8208;coordination framework and amorphous low&#8208;coordination phase achieves the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, RT) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, this work unravels the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provides a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high&#8208;voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold&#8208;pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

         <title>High Mechanical Strength Alloy&#8208;like Minerals Prepared by Inorganic Ionic Co&#8208;cross&#8208;linking</title>

This work develops inorganic ionic co&#8208;cross&#8208;linking by using calcium carbonate oligomers and calcium phosphate oligomers (CCOs and CPOs) to produce a group of compounds with the chemical formulas Ca(CO3)x(PO4)2(1&#8208;x)/3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1), referred to as CaCPs. They exhibit molecular homogeneity, a single&#8208;transition temperature and adjustable chemical compositions, and they are readily transformed to high strength alloy&#8208;like minerals (ALMs) by heat&#8208;induced crystallization.








Abstract
Alloys often combine different metals to generate superior mechanical properties. However, it is challenging to prepare high mechanical strength minerals with similar strategies. Using calcium carbonate (CaC) and calcium phosphate (CaP) as examples, this work synthesizes a group of compounds with the chemical formulas Ca(CO3)x(PO4)2(1&#8208;x)/3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1, CaCPs) by cross&#8208;linking ionic oligomers. Unlike mixtures, these CaCPs exhibit a single temperature for the phase transition from amorphous to crystallized CaC (calcite) and CaP (hydroxyapatite). By heat&#8208;induced synchronous crystallization, dual&#8208;phase CaC/CaP with continuous crystallized boundaries are resembled to alloy&#8208;like minerals (ALMs). The mechanical properties of the ALMs are adjusted by tailoring their chemical compositions to reach a hardness of 5.6&#160;GPa, which exceed those of control calcite and hydroxyapatite samples by 430% and 260%, respectively. This strategy expands the chemical scope of inorganic materials and holds promise for preparing high&#8208;performance minerals.

         <title>Delayed Crystallization Kinetics Allowing High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Photovoltaics with Superior Upscaled Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upscale manufacturing is critical for future practical applications. An all&#8208;polymer ternary system that enables a champion efficiency of 19% in small&#8208;area devices is developed here, and the delayed crystallization kinetics of all&#8208;polymer system benefitted optimized morphology is unveiled, thus leading to a record efficiency of 16.26% in large&#8208;area module with 19.3 cm2.








Abstract
Though encouraging performance is achieved in small&#8208;area organic photovoltaics (OPVs), reducing efficiency loss when evoluted to large&#8208;area modules is an important but unsolved issue. Considering that polymer materials show benefits in film&#8208;forming processability and mechanical robustness, a high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;polymer OPV module is demonstrated in this work. First, a ternary blend consisting of two polymer donors, PM6 and PBQx&#8208;TCl, and one polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, is developed, with which triplet state recombination is suppressed for a reduced energy loss, thus allowing a higher voltage; and donor&#8211;acceptor miscibility is compromised for enhanced charge transport, thus resulting in improved photocurrent and fill factor; all these contribute to a champion efficiency of 19% for all&#8208;polymer OPVs. Second, the delayed crystallization kinetics from solution to film solidification is achieved that gives a longer operation time window for optimized blend morphology in large&#8208;area module, thus relieving the loss of fill factor and allowing a record efficiency of 16.26% on an upscaled module with an area of 19.3 cm2. Besides, this all&#8208;polymer system also shows excellent mechanical stability. This work demonstrates that all&#8208;polymer ternary systems are capable of solving the upscaled manufacturing issue, thereby enabling high&#8208;efficiency OPV modules.

         <title>Scalable Printing of Metal Nanostructures through Superluminescent Light Projection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the superluminescent light projection (SLP) technique to rapidly print sub&#8208;diffraction metallic nanostructures, as small as 210&#160;nm, with light that is a billion times less intense than femtosecond lasers. As SLP is 480&#215; faster and 35&#215; less expensive than femtosecond laser printing, it breaks the traditional resolution versus cost and rate tradeoff in metal printing.








Abstract
Direct printing of metallic nanostructures is highly desirable but current techniques cannot achieve nanoscale resolutions or are too expensive and slow. Photoreduction of solvated metal ions into metallic nanoparticles is an attractive strategy because it is faster than deposition&#8208;based techniques. However, it is still limited by the resolution versus cost tradeoff because sub&#8208;diffraction printing of nanostructures requires high&#8208;intensity light from expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, this tradeoff is overcome by leveraging the spatial and temporal coherence properties of low&#8208;intensity diode&#8208;based superluminescent light. The superluminescent light projection (SLP) technique is presented to rapidly print sub&#8208;diffraction nanostructures, as small as 210&#160;nm and at periods as small as 300&#160;nm, with light that is a billion times less intense than femtosecond lasers. Printing of arbitrarily complex 2D nanostructured silver patterns over 30&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#215;&#160;80&#160;&#181;m areas in 500&#160;ms time scales is demonstrated. The post&#8208;annealed nanostructures exhibit an electrical conductivity up to 1/12th that of bulk silver. SLP is up to 480 times faster and 35 times less expensive than printing with femtosecond lasers. Therefore, it transforms nanoscale metal printing into a scalable format, thereby significantly enhancing the transition of nano&#8208;enabled devices from research laboratories into real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Achieving Desired Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells via Binary&#8208;Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) is successfully fabricated by binary&#8208;dilution strategy (PM6 is mixed with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and L8&#8208;BO is mixed with micro donor PM6, respectively), which not only remains donor/acceptor (D/A) vertical distribution of binary planar heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ), but gains larger D/A interpenetrating regions. The formation of ideal active layer morphology promotes excellent charge dynamics, and boosts the PCE of P&#8208;PHJ from 17.67% to 19.32%.








Abstract
The sequential deposition process has demonstrated the great possibility to achieve a photolayer architecture with an ideal gradient phase separation morphology, which has a vital influence on the physical processes that determine the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the controllable preparation of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) with gradient distribution has not been effectively elucidated. Herein, a binary&#8208;dilution strategy is proposed, the PM6 solution with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and the L8&#8208;BO solution with micro donor PM6 respectively, to form P&#8208;PHJ film. This architecture exists good donor (D) and acceptor (A) vertical gradient distribution and larger D/A interpenetrating regions, which promotes exciton generation and dissociation, shortens charge transport distance and optimizes carrier dynamics. Moreover, the dilution of PM6 by BO&#8208;4Cl promotes the regulation of active layer aggregation size and phase purity, thus alleviating energy disorder and voltage loss. As a result, the P&#8208;PHJ device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.32% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.92&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, much higher than planar binary heterojunction (17.67%) and ternary bulk heterojunction (18.49%) devices. This research proves a simple but effective method to provide an avenue for constructing desirable active layer morphology and high&#8208;performance OSCs.

Taurine is employed as the buried interface bridge to fabricate hole transport layer free low&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, leading to a high efficiency of 22.50% with an impressive VOC of 0.911 V, enabling all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 26.03%.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap (LBG,&#160;Eg&#160;&#8776;1.25&#160;eV)&#160;tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play critical roles in&#160;constructing efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) that can surpass the efficiency limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the traditional poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL) in LBG PSCs usually restricts device efficiency and stability. Here, a strategy of employing 2&#8208;aminoethanesulfonic acid (i.e., taurine) as the interface bridge to fabricate efficient HTL&#8208;free LBG PSCs with improved optoelectronic properties of the perovskite absorbers at the buried contacts is reported. Taurine&#8208;modified ITO substrate has lower optical losses, better energy level alignment, and higher charge transfer capability than PEDOT:PSS HTL, leading to significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density of corresponding devices. The best&#8208;performing LBG PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.50% and an impressive VOC of 0.911&#160;V is realized, enabling all&#8208;perovskite TSCs with an efficiency of 26.03%. The taurine&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free TSCs have highly increased stability, retaining more than 90% and 80% of their initial PCEs after constant operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 600&#160;h and under 55&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 950&#160;h, respectively. This work provides a facile strategy for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite devices with a simplified HTL&#8208;free architecture.

         <title>Natural Polyphenolic Nanodots for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal protocol to prepare natural polyphenolic nanodots by heating in aqueous solution without unacceptable additives is reported. The nanodots are able to not only inhibit amyloid&#8208;&#946; fibrillization and trigger the fibril disaggregation, but mitigate the amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#8208;plaque&#8208;induced cascade impairments including normalizing oxidative microenvironment, altering microglial polarization, and rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss.








Abstract
The abnormal amyloid&#8208;&#946; accumulation is essential and obbligato in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and natural polyphenols exhibit great potential as amyloid aggregation inhibitors. However, the poor metabolic stability, low bioavailability, and weak blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing ability of natural polyphenol molecules fail to meet clinical needs. Here, a universal protocol to prepare natural polyphenolic nanodots is developed by heating in aqueous solution without unacceptable additives. The nanodots are able to not only inhibit amyloid&#8208;&#946; fibrillization and trigger the fibril disaggregation, but mitigate the amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#8208;plaque&#8208;induced cascade impairments including normalizing oxidative microenvironment, altering microglial polarization, and rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss, which results in significant improvements in recognition and cognition deficits in transgenic mice. More importantly, natural polyphenolic nanodots possess stronger antiamyloidogenic performance compared with small molecule, as well as penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier. The excellent biocompatibility further guarantees the potential of natural polyphenolic nanodots for clinical applications. It is expected that natural polyphenolic nanodots provide an attractive paradigm to support the development of the therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>A 2D Heterostructure&#8208;Based Multifunctional Floating Gate Memory Device for Multimodal Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D van der Waals heterostructure&#8208;based multifunctional floating gate memory device is fabricated, which exhibits superior nonvolatile electronic/optoelectronic memory behaviors when subjected to intense stimuli and volatile memory behaviors after weakening the input stimuli. Leveraging its rich dynamics, a multimodal reservoir computing system, which can pave the way for future smart computing systems at the edge, is demonstrated.








Abstract
The demand for economical and efficient data processing has led to a surge of interest in neuromorphic computing based on emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in recent years. As a rising van der Waals (vdW) p&#8208;type Weyl semiconductor with many intriguing properties, tellurium (Te) has been widely used in advanced electronics/optoelectronics. However, its application in floating gate (FG) memory devices for information processing has never been explored. Herein, an electronic/optoelectronic FG memory device enabled by Te&#8208;based 2D vdW heterostructure for multimodal reservoir computing (RC) is reported. When subjected to intense electrical/optical stimuli, the device exhibits impressive nonvolatile electronic memory behaviors including &#8776;108 extinction ratio, &#8776;100 ns switching speed, &gt;4000 cycles, &gt;4000&#8208;s retention stability, and nonvolatile multibit optoelectronic programmable characteristics. When the input stimuli weaken, the nonvolatile memory degrades into volatile memory. Leveraging these rich nonlinear dynamics, a multimodal RC system with high recognition accuracy of 90.77% for event&#8208;type multimodal handwritten digit&#8208;recognition is demonstrated.

         <title>Electrochemical and Biocatalytic Signal&#8208;Controlled Payload Release from a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral pH in aqueous solutions and dissolves under acidic conditions, is loaded with a fluorescent dye as a model payload species. The pH is decreased by electrochemical or biocatalytic reactions resulting in the MOF dissolution and the payload release. The studied systems represent signal&#8208;responding materials for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.








Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral and slightly basic pH values in aqueous solutions and destabilized/dissolved under acidic conditions, is loaded with a pH&#8208;insensitive fluorescent dye, rhodamine&#8208;B isothiocyanate, as a model payload species. Then, the MOF species are immobilized at an electrode surface. The local (interfacial) pH value is rapidly decreased by means of an electrochemically stimulated ascorbate oxidation at +0.4&#160;V (Ag/AgCl/KCl). Oxygen reduction upon switching the applied potential to &#8722;0.8&#160;V allows to return the local pH to the neutral/basic pH, then stopping rapidly the release process. The developed method allows electrochemical control over stimulated or inhibited payload release processes from the MOF. The pH variation proceeds in a thin film of the solution near the electrode surface. The switchable release process is realized in a buffer solution and undiluted human serum. As the second option, the pH decrease stimulating the release process is achieved upon an enzymatic reaction using esterase and ester substrate. This approach potentially allows the release activation controlled by numerous enzymes assembled in complex biocatalytic cascades. It is expected that related electrochemical or biocatalytic systems can represent novel signal&#8208;responding materials with switchable features for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Efficiency and Operational&#8208;Stability of Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells via Interfacial Toughening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>

Incorporation of a self&#8208;assembled monolayer at the interface in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) results in simultaneous enhancement of mechanical reliability, operational&#8208;stability, and power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE). Threefold increase in the interfacial toughness in a PSC with PCE of over 24% is responsible for T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) of &#8776;18&#160;000&#160;h. Possible underlying mechanisms are elucidated.








Abstract
The combined effects of compact TiO2 (c&#8208;TiO2) electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) are investigated without and with mesoscopic TiO2 (m&#8208;TiO2) on top, and without and with an iodine&#8208;terminated silane self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), on the mechanical behavior, opto&#8211;electronic properties, photovoltaic (PV) performance, and operational&#8208;stability of solar cells based on metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs). The interfacial toughness increases almost threefold in going from c&#8208;TiO2 without SAM to m&#8208;TiO2 with SAM. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the m&#8208;TiO2/MHP nanocomposite at the interface and the enhanced adhesion afforded by the iodine&#8208;terminated silane SAM. The combination of m&#8208;TiO2 and SAM also offers a significant beneficial effect on the photocarriers extraction at the ETL/MHP interface, resulting in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 24% and 20% for 0.1 and 1&#160;cm2 active areas, respectively. These PSCs also have exceptionally long operational&#8208;stability lives: extrapolated T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) is &#8776;18&#160;000 and 10&#160;000&#160;h for 0.1 and 1&#160;cm2 active areas, respectively. Postmortem characterization and analyses of the operational&#8208;stability&#8208;tested PSCs are performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the long operational&#8208;stability.

         <title>Advancements of Intense Terahertz Field Focusing on Metallic Nanoarchitectures for Monitoring Hidden Interatomic Gas&#8208;Matter Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed terahertz (THz) methodology enables the real&#8208;time tracking of interatomic and interfacial gas&#8208;matter interactions, gas adsorption, hydrogenation, metal phase changes, and water&#8208;forming reactions in the resonance frequency and transmittance domains. Robust THz nanoscopic probes reveal the underlying pathway and lattice dynamics inside the hidden stage of palladium during hydrogen/oxygen exposure and the subsequent catalytic reaction.








Abstract
With the advancements of nanotechnology, innovative photonic designs coupled with functional materials provide a unique way to acquire, share, and respond effectively to information. It is found that the simple deposition of a 30&#160;nm&#8208;thick palladium nanofilm on a terahertz (THz) metasurface chip with a 14&#160;nm&#8208;wide effective nanogap of asymmetric materials and geometries allows the tracking of both interatomic and interfacial gas&#8211;matter interactions, including gas adsorption, hydrogenation (or dehydrogenation), metal phase changes, and unique water&#8208;forming reactions. Combinatorial analyses by simulation and experimental measurements demonstrate the distinct nanostructures, which leads to significant light&#8208;matter interactions and corresponding THz absorption in a real&#8208;time, highly repeatable, and reliable manner. The complex lattice dynamics and intrinsic properties of metals influenced by hydrogen gas exposure are also thoroughly examined using systematically controlled ternary gas mixture devices that mimic normal temperature and pressure. Furthermore, the novel degrees of freedom are utilized to analyze various physical phenomena, and thus, analytical methods that enable the tracking of unknown hidden stages of water&#8208;forming reactions resulting in water growth are introduced. A single exposure of the wave spectrum emphasizes the robustness of the proposed THz nanoscopic probe, bridging the gap between fundamental laboratory research and industry.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Heat Circulation Metadevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Having developed a comprehensive thermal scattering theory that describes the nonreciprocal transmission properties of temperature field effectively, a metadevice that supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat transfer is created. It uncovers the unique multiple&#8208;scattering effect at steady state, which is anticipated to lead to intriguing applications in thermal energy utilization and thermal information processing.








Abstract
Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature&#8208;dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works have been compelled to treat dynamic and steady&#8208;state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, the creation of a convection&#8208;based thermal metadevice which supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat circulation is reported. The nontrivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters is observed and the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering is revealed at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi&#8208;symmetric scattering matrix of the three&#8208;port metadevice and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. The findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady&#8208;state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat&#8208;transfer&#8208;related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.

         <title>Efficient Photothermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Enabled by 3D Cu2&#8208;xS Encapsulated Phase Change Materials Mixed Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Cu2&#8208;xS shells are designed to realize LSPR modulation. The MPCMs possess full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coating is developed to achieve efficient anti&#8208;/deicing. The MPCMs and composite coatings provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced anti&#8208;/deicing applications.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are one of the most promising anti&#8208;/deicing materials, yet they are limited by the low energy density and intermittent nature of solar energy. Here, a coupling solution based on microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) that integrates photothermal effect and phase change thermal storage is proposed. Dual&#8208;shell octahedral MPCMs with Cu2O as the first layer and 3D Cu2&#8208;xS as the second layer for the first time is designed. By morphology and phase manipulation of the Cu2&#8208;xS shell, the local surface plasmonic heating modulation of MPCMs is realized, and the MPCM reveals full&#8208;spectrum high absorption with a photothermal conversion efficiency up to 96.1%. The phase change temperature and enthalpy remain in good consistency after 200 cycles. Multifunctional photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings are fabricated by combining the hydrolyzed and polycondensation products of octadecyl trichlorosilane and the dual&#8208;shell MPCM. The multifunctional coatings exhibit excellent anti&#8208;/deicing performance under low temperature and high humidity conditions. This work not only provides a new approach for the design of high&#8208;performance MPCMs but also opens up an avenue for the anti&#8208;icing application of photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings.

         <title>Intestine&#8208;Targeted Explosive Hydrogel Microsphere Promotes Uric Acid Excretion for Gout Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microspheres achieve a slow release of uricase in the small intestine, where dopamine undergoes an in situ&#160;polymerization reaction mucosa, significantly upregulating the uric acid transporter protein of epithelial cells. A&#160;unique induction pathway is developed through in situ modulation of intestinal mucosal layer, enabling efficient intestinal excretion of uric acid for gout therapy.








Abstract
Uric acid metabolism disorder triggers metabolic diseases, especially gout. However, increasing uric acid excretion remains a challenge. Here, an accelerative uric acid excretion pathway via an oral intestine&#8208;explosive hydrogel microsphere merely containing uricase and dopamine is reported. After oral administration, uricase is exposed and immobilized on intestinal mucosa along with an in situ dopamine polymerization via a cascade reaction triggered by the intestinal specific environment. By this means, trace amount of uricase is required to in situ up&#8208;regulate uric acid transporter proteins of intestinal epithelial cells, causing accelerated intestinal uric acid excretion. From in vitro data, the uric acid in fecal samples from gout patients could be significantly reduced by up to 37% by the mimic mucosa&#8208;immobilized uricase on the isolated porcine tissues. Both hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis in vivo mouse models confirm the uric acid excretion efficacy of intestine&#8208;explosive hydrogel microspheres. Fecal uric acid excretion is increased around 30% and blood uric acid is reduced more than 70%. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing showed that the microspheres optimized intestinal flora composition as well. In conclusion, a unique pathway via the intestine in situ regulation to realize an efficient uric acid intestinal excretion for gout therapy is developed.

&lt;p&gt;Uric acid metabolism disorder triggers metabolic diseases, especially gout. However, increasing uric acid excretion remains a challenge. Here, an accelerative uric acid excretion pathway via an oral intestine-explosive hydrogel microsphere merely containing uricase and dopamine is reported. After oral administration, uricase is exposed and immobilized on intestinal mucosa along with an in situ dopamine polymerization via a cascade reaction triggered by the intestinal specific environment. By this means, trace amount of uricase is required to in situ up-regulate uric acid transporter proteins of intestinal epithelial cells, causing accelerated intestinal uric acid excretion. From in vitro data, the uric acid in fecal samples from gout patients could be significantly reduced by up to 37% by the mimic mucosa-immobilized uricase on the isolated porcine tissues. Both hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis in vivo mouse models confirm the uric acid excretion efficacy of intestine-explosive hydrogel microspheres. Fecal uric acid excretion is increased around 30% and blood uric acid is reduced more than 70%. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing showed that the microspheres optimized intestinal flora composition as well. In conclusion, a unique pathway via the intestine in situ regulation to realize an efficient uric acid intestinal excretion for gout therapy is developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Control of Phases and Electronic Structures of Monolayer TaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer 1H and 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films are selectively grown by varying the substrate temperature, and a new 2 &#215; 2 superstructure is observed upon further annealing the 1H films, leading to gap opening up to room temperature as revealed by photoemission measurements. This work demonstrates the selective control of phases and electronic structures of monolayer TaTe2 film.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films exhibit rich phases and superstructures, which can be controlled by the growth conditions as well as post&#8208;growth annealing treatment. Here, the selective growth of monolayer TaTe2 films with different phases as well as superstructures using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is reported. Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaTe2 and 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films can be selectively controlled by varying the growth temperature, and their different electronic structures are revealed through the combination of angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Moreover, post&#8208;growth annealing of the 1H&#8208;TaTe2 film further leads to a transition from a 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19}{\times }\sqrt {19}$ superstructure to a new 2 &#215; 2 superstructure, where two gaps are observed in the electronic structure and persist up to room temperature. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal the role of the phonon instability in the formation of superstructures and the effect of local atomic distortions on the modified electronic structures. This work demonstrates the manipulation of the rich phases and superstructures of monolayer TaTe2 films by controlling the growth kinetics and post&#8208;growth&#160;annealing.

         <title>Robust Photothermal Icephobic Surface with Mechanical Durability of Multi&#8208;Bioinspired Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;bioinspired structured microspine array inspired by honeycomb and cactus thorn (i.e., MAHC) with the characterization of mechanical durability achieves robust photothermal icephobicity in cold or low&#8208;temperature environments with potentially intense abrasion, which can be applied on curvature surface (e.g., copper alloy transmission line) of overhead high&#8208;speed rail and trains in transportation fields.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are potential to become ideal anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces due to their rapid water removal, icing delay, and photothermal deicing performance. Here, a robust photothermal icephobic surface with mechanical durability is shown that is integrated with a microspine array inspired by honeycomb and cactus thorn (i.e., MAHC), which is developed by a laser&#8208;layered microfabrication strategy. The maximum stress on the microspine of the MAHC is reduced by &#8776;2/3, due to the protection of the bionic honeycomb structure. Even after 200 linear abrasions by a steel blade, the MAHC remains superior water repellency with a water contact angle of 150.7&#176; and roll&#8208;off angles of 10.3&#176;, stable icing delay time (578.2 s), and rapidly photothermal deicing capabilities (401 s). As the MAHC is fabricated on a curvature surface such as a copper alloy transmission line for an overhead high&#8208;speed rail, a stable photothermal anti&#8208;/deicing in a low&#8208;temperature environment still can be achieved effectively. The freezing rain covering the functional transmission line completely slides off within 758 s under one sun illumination. This studying offers insight into the design of novel materials with stable anti&#8208;icing/icephobic structures, which would be extended into some applied realms, for example, transportation fields or power systems in cold or low&#8208;temperature climates.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting Strategy Empowers High&#8208;Boiling Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Over 18.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hot&#8208;casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly in the active layer, which contributes to preferable vertical phase separation, donor/acceptor ratio, and molecular stacking. The profitable morphology is beneficial to charge generation and extraction, leading to top&#8208;ranked device efficiencies based on different matrixes and high&#8208;boiling solvents.








Abstract
Most top&#8208;rank organic solar cells (OSCs) are manufactured by the halogenated solvent chloroform, which possesses a narrow processing window due to its low&#8208;boiling point. Herein, based on two high&#8208;boiling solvents, halogenated solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and non&#8208;halogenated green solvent ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), preparing active layers with the hot solution is put forward to enhance the performance of the OSCs. In situ test and morphological characterization clarify that the hot&#8208;casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly of both donor and acceptor in the active layer, contributing to preferable donor/acceptor ratio, vertical phase separation, and molecular stacking, which is beneficial to charge generation and extraction. Based on the PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl, the hot&#8208;casting OSCs with a wide processing window achieve efficiencies of 18.03% in CB and 18.12% in OX, which are much higher than the devices processed with room temperature solution. Moreover, the hot&#8208;casting devices with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 deliver a remarkable fill factor&#160;of 80.31% and efficiency&#160;of 18.52% in OX, representing the record value among binary devices with green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to manipulate the molecular distribution and arrangement for boosting the efficiency of OSCs with high&#8208;boiling solvents.

         <title>A Novel Superparamagnetic Multifunctional Nerve Scaffold: A Remote Actuation Strategy to Boost In Situ Extracellular Vesicles Production for Enhanced Peripheral Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mag&#8208;gel with applied rotating magnetic field (RMF) serves as a mechano&#8208;stimulative platform to exert micro/nanoscale forces to nearby Schwann cells, which can subsequently scale up local extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#160;production both in vitro and in vivo. As a non&#8208;invasive strategy, application of an RMF to manipulate the local EVs production via the Mag&#8208;gel offers a remote time&#8208;scheduled approach to optimize the process of peripheral nerve regeneration.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have inherent advantages over cell&#8208;based therapies in regenerative medicine because of their cargos of abundant bioactive cues. Several strategies are proposed to tune EVs production in vitro. However, it remains a challenge for manipulation of EVs production in vivo, which poses significant difficulties for EVs&#8208;based therapies that aim to promote tissue regeneration, particularly for long&#8208;term treatment of diseases like peripheral neuropathy. Herein, a superparamagnetic nanocomposite scaffold capable of controlling EVs production on&#8208;demand is constructed by incorporating polyethyleneglycol/polyethyleneimine modified superparamagnetic nanoparticles into a polyacrylamide/hyaluronic acid double&#8208;network hydrogel (Mag&#8208;gel). The Mag&#8208;gel is highly sensitive to a rotating magnetic field (RMF), and can act as mechano&#8208;stimulative platform to exert micro/nanoscale forces on encapsulated Schwann cells (SCs), an essential glial cell in supporting nerve regeneration. By switching the ON/OFF state of the RMF, the Mag&#8208;gel can scale up local production of SCs&#8208;derived EVs (SCs&#8208;EVs) both in vitro and in vivo. Further transcriptome sequencing indicates an enrichment of transcripts favorable in axon growth, angiogenesis, and inflammatory regulation of SCs&#8208;EVs in the Mag&#8208;gel with RMF, which ultimately results in optimized nerve repair in vivo. Overall, this research provides a noninvasive and remotely time&#8208;scheduled method for fine&#8208;tuning EVs&#8208;based therapies to accelerate tissue regeneration, including that of peripheral nerves.

         <title>Electron Oscillation&#8208;Induced Splitting Electroluminescence from Nano&#8208;LEDs&#160;for Device&#8208;Level Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasimple nanoscale light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) based on a three&#8208;dimensional confined electron system is demonstrated. By employing the non&#8208;carrier injection nano LED (NCI&#8208;nLED), a device&#8208;level encryption is proposed, in which multiple pulses acts as carriers for transmitted digital information, providing an alternative encryption platform and method for converting digital signals to optical signals.








Abstract
Data security is a major concern in digital age, which generally relies on algorithm&#8208;based mathematical encryption. Recently, encryption techniques based on physical principles are emerging and being developed, leading to the new generation of encryption moving from mathematics to the intersection of mathematics and physics. Here, device&#8208;level encryption with ideal security is ingeniously achieved using modulation of the electron&#8211;hole radiative recombination in a GaN&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). When a nano&#8208;LED is driven in the non&#8208;carrier injection mode, the oscillation of confined electrons can split what should be a single light pulse into multiple pulses. The morphology (amplitude, shape, and pulse number) of those history&#8208;dependent multiple pulses that act as carriers for transmitted digital information depends highly on the parameters of the driving signals, which makes those signals mathematically uncrackable and can increase the volume and security of transmitted information. Moreover, a hardware and software platform are designed to demonstrate the encrypted data transmission based on the device&#8208;level encryption method, enabling recognition of the entire ASCII code table. The device&#8208;level encryption based on splitting electroluminescence provides an encryption method during the conversion process of digital signals to optical signals and can improve the security of LED&#8208;based communication.

         <title>Simultaneous Catalytic Acceleration of White Phosphorus Polymerization and Red Phosphorus Potassiation for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of I2 can simultaneously catalyze the acceleration of white phosphorus polymerization and enhance red phosphorus potassiation for high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion batteries. The P/C composites with an I2 catalyst deliver excellent cycling stability (358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (200&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium&#8208;ion batteries possesses ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity (1154&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K&#8208;P alloying limit its practical application. Seeking an efficient catalyst to address the above problems is crucial for the secure preparation of red P anode with high performance. Herein, through the analysis of the activation energies in white P polymerization, it is revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital energy of I2 (&#8722;7.40&#160;eV) is in proximity to P4 (&#8722;7.25&#160;eV), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy of I2 molecule (&#8722;4.20&#160;eV) is lower than that of other common non&#8208;metallic molecules (N2, S8, Se8, F2, Cl2, Br2). The introduction of I2 can thus promote the breaking of the P&#9472;P bond and accelerate the polymerization of white P molecules. Besides, the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that I2 can enhance the kinetics of P&#8208;K alloying. The as&#8208;obtained red P/C composites with I2 deliver excellent cycling stability (358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This study establishes catalysis as a promising pathway to tackle the challenges of P anode for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on a Functional Unit Combination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional unit combination strategy is developed to fabricate purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. In this strategy, the folding units are responsible for spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement while diverse luminescent core units contribute to tunable color/lifetime, which facilitates the construction of a series of new molecules with high&#8208;efficiency, color/lifetime&#8208;tunable, and photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP.








Abstract
A rational molecular design strategy facilitates the development of a purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material system with precisely regulated luminescence properties, which surely promotes its functional integration and intelligent application. Here, a functional unit combination strategy is proposed to design novel RTP molecules combining a folding unit with diverse luminescent cores. The different luminescent cores are mainly responsible for tunable RTP properties, while the folding unit contributes to the spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement, which makes the RTP material design as workable as the building block principle. By this strategy, a series of color/lifetime&#8208;tunable RTP materials is achieved with unique photo&#8208;responsive RTP enhancement when subjected to UV irradiation, which expands their application scenarios in reusable privacy tags, advanced &#8220;4D&#8221; encryption, and phase separation analysis of blended polymers. This work suggests a simple and effective strategy to design purely organic RTP materials with tunable color and lifetime, and also provides new application options for photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP materials.

         <title>18.6% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor Based on Benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d&#8242;]bisthiazole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide bandgap polymer donor based on benzobisthiazole is designed with deep energy level, high planar structure, and good crystallinity, which endows the good complementary absorption, energy level match, and fibril&#8208;like morphology with polymer acceptors, and thus realizes high power conversion efficiencies of 17.15% and 18.60% in the binary and ternary blend all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract
The limited selection of wide bandgap polymer donors for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is a bottleneck problem restricting their further development and remains poorly studied. Herein, a new wide bandgap polymer, namely PBBTz&#8208;Cl, is designed and synthesized by bridging the benzobisthiazole acceptor block and chlorinated benzodithiophene donor block with thiophene units for application as an electron donor in all&#8208;PSCs. PBBTz&#8208;Cl not only possesses wide bandgap and deep energy levels but also displays strong absorption, high&#8208;planar structure, and good crystallinity, making it a promising candidate for application as a polymer donor in organic solar cells. When paired with the narrow bandgap polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, a fibril&#8208;like morphology forms, which facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport, contributing to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.15% of the corresponding all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, when introducing another crystalline polymer acceptor BTP&#8208;2T2F into the PBBTz&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host blend, the absorption ditch in the range of 600&#8211;750&#160;nm is filled, and the blend morphology is further optimized with the trap density reducing. As a result, the ternary blend all&#8208;PSCs achieve a significantly improved PCE of 18.60%, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;PSCs to date.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Synthesis of 2D Ternary Transition Metal Phosphorous Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable synthesis of transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) based on subtracting elements mechanism is reported. Among them, the SnPS3 exhibits effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;m&#160;V&#8722;1. The CdPSe3 photodetector displays high responsivity (582&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones). This research will pave the way for exploration of ternary TMPCs in optical and photoelectric detection.








Abstract
The 2D ternary transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) have attracted extensive research interest due to their widely tunable band gap, rich electronic properties, inherent magnetic and ferroelectric properties. However, the synthesis of TMPCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still challenging since it is difficult to control reactions among multi&#8208;precursors. Here, a subtractive element growth mechanism is proposed to controllably synthesize the TMPCs. Based on the growth mechanism, the TMPCs including FePS3, FePSe3, MnPS3, MnPSe3, CdPS3, CdPSe3, In2P3S9, and SnPS3 are achieved successfully and further confirmed by Raman, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The typical TMPCs&#8211;SnPS3 shows a strong SHG signal at 1064&#160;nm, with an effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;m&#160;V&#8722;1, which is about 8 times of that in MoS2. And the photodetector based on CdPSe3 exhibits superior detection performances with responsivity of 582&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, high detectivity of 3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones, and fast rise time of 611&#160;&#181;s, which is better than most previously reported TMPCs&#8208;based photodetectors. These results demonstrate the high quality of TMPCs and promote the exploration of the optical properties of 2D TMPCs for their applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Cd&#8208;Free Pure Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 Solar Cell with Over 800&#160;mV Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Enabled by Phase Evolution Intervention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ge cap layer is applied atop the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor to enable phase evolution intervention during sulfurization. It defers the crystallization of CZTS to higher temperatures, thereby reducing grain boundaries and enhancing crystallinity in the final CZTS film. With this strategy, an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 800 mV and a champion efficiency of 10.7% Cd&#8208;free CZTS solar cells are demonstrated.








Abstract
The Cd&#8208;free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cell is an ideal candidate for producing low&#8208;cost clean energy through green materials owing to its inherent environmental friendliness and earth abundance. Nevertheless, sulfide CZTS has long suffered from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits, limiting the full exploitation of performance potential and further progress. Here, an effective strategy is proposed to alleviate the nonradiative VOC loss by manipulating the phase evolution during the critical kesterite phase formation stage. With a Ge cap layer on the precursor, premature CZTS grain formation is suppressed at low temperatures, leading to fewer nucleation centers at the initial crystallization stage. Consequently, the CZTS grain formation and crystallization are deferred to high temperatures, resulting in enhanced grain interior quality and less unfavorable grain boundaries in the final film. As a result, a champion efficiency of 10.7% for Cd&#8208;free CZTS solar cells with remarkably high VOC beyond 800&#160;mV (63.2% Schockley&#8211;Queisser limit) is realized, indicating that nonradiative recombination is effectively inhibited. This strategy may advance other compound semiconductors seeking high&#8208;quality crystallization.

         <title>Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible and Recoverable Carbon Nitrides Featuring CN4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully saturated polymeric carbon nitrides are one of the holy grails of material sciences due to their expected exceptional superhardness. Here, the high&#8208;pressure synthesis of three novel carbon nitrides comprised of corner&#8208;sharing CN4 tetrahedra is reported. They are recoverable to ambient conditions and stable in air, feature ultra&#8208;incompressibility, superhardness, and other attractive properties such as piezoelectricity and fluorescence.








Abstract
Carbon nitrides featuring three&#8208;dimensional frameworks of CN4 tetrahedra are one of the great aspirations of materials science, expected to have a hardness greater than or comparable to diamond. After more than three decades of efforts to synthesize them, no unambiguous evidence of their existence has been delivered. Here, the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis of three carbon&#8211;nitrogen compounds, tI14&#8208;C3N4, hP126&#8208;C3N4, and tI24&#8208;CN2, in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, is reported. Their structures are solved and refined using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Physical properties investigations show that these strongly covalently bonded materials, ultra&#8208;incompressible and superhard, also possess high energy density, piezoelectric, and photoluminescence properties. The novel carbon nitrides are unique among high&#8208;pressure materials, as being produced above 100&#160;GPa they are recoverable in air at ambient conditions.

Zinc Anodes
As the world seeks alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries emerge as a promising alternative due to their low cost, abundance, and safety. Their adoption, however, is limited by low efficiency and dendritic growth issues. In article number 2306145, Richard B. Kaner and co&#8208;workers introduce a zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase that enhances stability and prevents dendrites, significantly improving battery performance and lifespan. This innovation paves the way for zinc batteries as a more practical and sustainable option for energy storage.

Gas Sensing
Light&#8208;assisted investigation of gas&#8211;matter interactions have been regarded challenging area of study. A real&#8208;time and highly reliable gas&#8208;molecule&#8208;sensing scheme, employing an asymmetric nanogap architecture with distinct compositional metals, allows the study of nanoscale gas dynamics and water forming. Maximized light absorption and an enhanced terahertz field are realized, opening up new routes for analyzing molecular dynamics behavior. More details can be found in article number 2308975 by Yong&#8208;Sang Ryu, Minah Seo, and co&#8208;workers.

MXenes
In article number 2305183, Se&#8208;Ho Kim, Baptiste Gault, and co&#8208;workers report how impurities are detected on MXenes by careful nanoscale compositional mapping via atom probe tomography. The impurities remain attached upon oxidation of the MXene sheets that roll upon themselves. The presence of these impurities has often been overlooked, but is poised to play a role on the activity and stability of MXenes.

         <dc:description>
Powered by flagella beating, functionalized microalgae robots are demonstrated to move through various biological fluids, water matrices and harsh environments, while performing diverse tasks toward critical biomedical and environmental applications. This review introduces the design, preparation, fabrication, unique functions and latest progress and applications of microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots, leveraging the attractive self&#8208;propulsion capability of natural microalgae and the versatile modalities of functional materials.








Abstract
The integration of microorganisms and engineered artificial components has shown considerable promise for creating biohybrid microrobots. The unique features of microalgae make them attractive candidates as natural actuation materials for the design of biohybrid microrobotic systems. In this review, microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots are introduced for diverse biomedical and environmental applications. The distinct propulsion and phototaxis behaviors of green microalgae, as well as important properties from other photosynthetic microalga systems (blue&#8208;green algae and diatom) that are crucial to constructing powerful biohybrid microrobots, will be described first. Then the focus is on chemical and physical routes for functionalizing the algae surface with diverse reactive materials toward the fabrication of advanced biohybrid microalgae robots. Finally, representative applications of such algae&#8208;driven microrobots are presented, including drug delivery, imaging, and water decontamination, highlighting the distinct advantages of these active biohybrid robots, along with future prospects and challenges.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Bioaffinity Assays: From the Research Laboratory to the Market</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically discusses advances in nanoparticle&#8208;based labels (yellow) combined with biorecognition elements (green) and suitable readout schemes for the design of new bioaffinity assays. The route of nanoparticle&#8208;based assays from the bench to real sample analysis and commercialization follows a rugged path winding between many challenges and benefits.








Abstract
Advances in the development of new biorecognition elements, nanoparticle&#8208;based labels as well as instrumentation have inspired the design of new bioaffinity assays. This review critically discusses the potential of nanoparticles to replace current enzymatic or molecular labels in immunoassays and other bioaffinity assays. Successful implementations of nanoparticles in commercial assays and the need for rapid tests incorporating nanoparticles in different roles such as capture support, signal generation elements, and signal amplification systems are highlighted. The limited number of nanoparticles applied in current commercial assays can be explained by challenges associated with the analysis of real samples (e.g., blood, urine, or nasal swabs) that are difficult to resolve, particularly if the same performance can be achieved more easily by conventional labels. Lateral flow assays that are based on the visual detection of the red&#8208;colored line formed by colloidal gold are a notable exception, exemplified by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 rapid antigen tests that have moved from initial laboratory testing to widespread market adaption in less than two years.

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings of Hydrogen Bond Chemistry in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review is provided on the application and key factors of hydrogen bond chemistry in various aqueous batteries, encompassing electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, and binders. Accurate insights are presented to utilize hydrogen bond chemistry in order to address a range of key factors that hinder electrochemical performance, aiming to drive the progress of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are emerging as highly promising contenders for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage because of uncomplicated assembly, exceptional safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The unique aqueous electrolyte with a rich hydrogen bond (HB) environment inevitably has a significant impact on the electrode materials and electrochemical processes. While numerous reviews have focused on the materials design and assembly of aqueous batteries, the utilization of HB chemistry is overlooked. Herein, instead of merely compiling recent advancements, this review presents a comprehensive summary and analysis of the profound implication exerted by HB on all components of the aqueous batteries. Intricate links between the novel HB chemistry and various aqueous batteries are ingeniously constructed within the critical aspects, such as self&#8208;discharge, structural stability of electrode materials, pulverization, solvation structures, charge carrier diffusion, corrosion reactions, pH sensitivity, water splitting, polysulfides shuttle, and H2S evolution. By adopting a vantage point that encompasses material design, binder and separator functionalization, electrolyte regulation, and HB optimization, a critical examination of the key factors that impede electrochemical performance in diverse aqueous batteries is conducted. Finally, insights are rendered properly based on HB chemistry, with the aim of propelling the advancement of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review is provided on the application and key factors of hydrogen bond chemistry in various aqueous batteries, encompassing electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, and binders. Accurate insights are presented to utilize hydrogen bond chemistry in order to address a range of key factors that hinder electrochemical performance, aiming to drive the progress of state-of-the-art aqueous batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous batteries are emerging as highly promising contenders for large-scale grid energy storage because of uncomplicated assembly, exceptional safety, and cost-effectiveness. The unique aqueous electrolyte with a rich hydrogen bond (HB) environment inevitably has a significant impact on the electrode materials and electrochemical processes. While numerous reviews have focused on the materials design and assembly of aqueous batteries, the utilization of HB chemistry is overlooked. Herein, instead of merely compiling recent advancements, this review presents a comprehensive summary and analysis of the profound implication exerted by HB on all components of the aqueous batteries. Intricate links between the novel HB chemistry and various aqueous batteries are ingeniously constructed within the critical aspects, such as self-discharge, structural stability of electrode materials, pulverization, solvation structures, charge carrier diffusion, corrosion reactions, pH sensitivity, water splitting, polysulfides shuttle, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S evolution. By adopting a vantage point that encompasses material design, binder and separator functionalization, electrolyte regulation, and HB optimization, a critical examination of the key factors that impede electrochemical performance in diverse aqueous batteries is conducted. Finally, insights are rendered properly based on HB chemistry, with the aim of propelling the advancement of state-of-the-art aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are currently available as treatment methods.

Novel therapeutics have been exploited to address complicated resistance mechanisms of lung cancer and the advancement of nanomedicine is extremely promising in terms of overcoming drug resistance. Nanomedicine equipped with multifunctional and tunable physiochemical properties in alignment with tumor genetic profiles can achieve precise, safe, and effective treatment while minimizing or eradicating drug resistance in cancer. Here, this work reviews the discovered resistance mechanisms for lung cancer chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, and outlines novel strategies for the development of nanomedicine against drug resistance. This work focuses on engineering design, customized delivery, current challenges, and clinical translation of nanomedicine in the application of resistant lung cancer.

         <title>Understanding the Electrical Mechanisms in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: From Electrostatic Interactions to Electric Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced approaches to prohibit dendrite growth, suppress side reactions, and promote reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes are essential for practical Zn metal batteries. In this review, the effects of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic interaction and electrical field regulation on the Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behavior in aqueous Zn metal batteries, with an emphasis on the challenges and prospects, are summarized.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are considered as competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their excellent safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the inevitable dendrite growth, severe hydrogen evolution, surface passivation, and sluggish reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes hinder the practical application of Zn metal batteries. Detailed summaries and prospects have been reported focusing on the research progress and challenges of Zn metal anodes, including electrolyte engineering, electrode structure design, and surface modification. However, the essential electrical mechanisms that significantly influence Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behaviors have not been reviewed yet. Herein, in this review, the regulation mechanisms of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic repulsive/attractive interactions on Zn2+ ions migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors are systematically discussed. Meanwhile, electric field regulation strategies to promote the Zn2+ ions diffusion and uniform Zn deposition are comprehensively reviewed, including enhancing and homogenizing electric field intensity inside the batteries and adding external magnetic/pressure/thermal field to couple with the electric field. Finally, future perspectives on the research directions of the electrical&#8208;related strategies for building better Zn metal batteries in practical applications are offered.

         <dc:description>
This review outlines a unique category of van der Waals materials that support novel devices for high&#8208;performance detection. Based on the insight into the unique properties of the material systems and the underlying microscopic mechanisms, emerging trends in junction devices are discussed, a new morphology of photodetectors is proposed, and some potential innovative directions in the subject area are suggested.








Abstract
With the continuous advancement of nanofabrication techniques, development of novel materials, and discovery of useful manipulation mechanisms in high&#8208;performance applications, especially photodetectors, the morphology of junction devices and the way junction devices are used are fundamentally revolutionized. Simultaneously, new types of photodetectors that do not rely on any junction, providing a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and multidimensional modulation, have also emerged. This review outlines a unique category of material systems supporting novel junction devices for high&#8208;performance detection, namely, the van der Waals materials, and systematically discusses new trends in the development of various types of devices beyond junctions. This field is far from mature and there are numerous methods to measure and evaluate photodetectors. Therefore, it is also aimed to provide a solution from the perspective of applications in this review. Finally, based on the insight into the unique properties of the material systems and the underlying microscopic mechanisms, emerging trends in junction devices are discussed, a new morphology of photodetectors is proposed, and some potential innovative directions in the subject area are suggested.

         <title>Emerging Xene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Theory, Synthesis, and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis, precise characterization, and catalytic applications of emerging Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations are the focus of this review. It is envisioned that this timely review can shed light on new designs of high&#8208;performance Xene&#8208;related single&#8208;atom nanoplatforms for next&#8208;generation chemical and energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the emergence of novel 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes), e.g., graphdiyne, borophene, phosphorene, antimonene, bismuthene, and stanene, has exhibited unprecedented potentials for their versatile applications as well as addressing new discoveries in fundamental science. Owing to their unique physicochemical, optical, and electronic properties, emerging Xenes have been regarded as promising candidates in the community of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) as single&#8208;atom active sites or support matrixes for significant improvement in intrinsic activity and selectivity. In order to comprehensively understand the relationships between the structure and property of Xene&#8208;based SACs, this review represents a comprehensive summary from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Firstly, theoretical calculations regarding both the anchoring of Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom active sites on versatile support matrixes and doping/substituting heteroatoms at Xene&#8208;based support matrixes are briefly summarized. Secondly, controlled synthesis and precise characterization are presented for Xene&#8208;based SACs.

     alt="Emerging Xene-Based Single-Atom Catalysts: Theory, Synthesis, and Catalytic Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlled synthesis, precise characterization, and catalytic applications of emerging Xene-based single-atom catalysts from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations are the focus of this review. It is envisioned that this timely review can shed light on new designs of high-performance Xene-related single-atom nanoplatforms for next-generation chemical and energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the emergence of novel 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes), e.g., graphdiyne, borophene, phosphorene, antimonene, bismuthene, and stanene, has exhibited unprecedented potentials for their versatile applications as well as addressing new discoveries in fundamental science. Owing to their unique physicochemical, optical, and electronic properties, emerging Xenes have been regarded as promising candidates in the community of single-atom catalysts (SACs) as single-atom active sites or support matrixes for significant improvement in intrinsic activity and selectivity. In order to comprehensively understand the relationships between the structure and property of Xene-based SACs, this review represents a comprehensive summary from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Firstly, theoretical calculations regarding both the anchoring of Xene-based single-atom active sites on versatile support matrixes and doping/substituting heteroatoms at Xene-based support matrixes are briefly summarized. Secondly, controlled synthesis and precise characterization are presented for Xene-based SACs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the development of Xene-based SACs are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemically Activated 3D Printing Inks: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

Enabling precision control over photochemical reactions is essential for designing advanced photoresists with diverse functionalities. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing are evaluated. The discussed photoresists are classified into chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities, limitations, and realistic possibilities for the near future.








Abstract
3D printing with light is enabled by the photochemistry underpinning it. Without fine control over the ability to photochemically gate covalent bond formation by the light at a certain wavelength and intensity, advanced photoresists with functions spanning from on&#8208;demand degradability, adaptability, rapid printing speeds, and tailored functionality are impossible to design. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing applications are critically assessed, and an outlook of the outstanding challenges and opportunities is provided. This is achieved by classing the discussed photoresists in chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed. Such a taxonomy is based on the efficiency with which photons are able to generate covalent bonds, with each concept featuring distinct advantages and drawbacks.

         <title>Atomic Distance Engineering in Metal Catalysts to Regulate Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic distance has an important influence on the symmetry and electronic structure of active metal atom. It is classified into three types, namely, the bond length between metal and coordination atom, the distance between single&#8208;atom sites and the arrangement spacing of metal atoms, and their corresponding design strategies and improvement on catalytic performance are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
It is very important to understand the structure&#8211;performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we&#160;discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. First, the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single&#8208;atom site on the catalytic performance are introduced. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high&#8208;shell doping and can evolve during the reaction. Next, the influence of the distance between single&#8208;atom sites on the catalytic performance is discussed. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance is given.

         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the relationship between ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric effects and the fundamental principles of different catalytic reactions, highlights the preparation methods of these three materials and the significant progress made in their biomedical applications. The review concludes by presenting key challenges and future prospects for efficient catalysts based on piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric nanomaterials for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric materials are considered unique biomedical materials due to their dielectric crystals and asymmetric centers that allow them to directly convert various primary forms of energy in the environment, such as sunlight, mechanical energy, and thermal energy, into secondary energy, such as electricity and chemical energy. These materials possess exceptional energy conversion ability and excellent catalytic properties, which have led to their widespread usage within biomedical fields. Numerous biomedical applications have demonstrated great potential with these materials, including disease treatment, biosensors, and tissue engineering. For example, piezoelectric materials are used to stimulate cell growth in bone regeneration, while pyroelectric materials are applied in skin cancer detection and imaging. Ferroelectric materials have even found use in neural implants that record and stimulate electrical activity in the brain. This paper reviews the relationship between ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric effects and the fundamental principles of different catalytic reactions. It also highlights the preparation methods of these three materials and the significant progress made in their biomedical applications. The review concludes by presenting key challenges and future prospects for efficient catalysts based on piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Interface as A Cell Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In sharp contrast to conventional solid/hydrogel platforms, water&#8208;immiscible liquids, such as perfluorocarbons and silicones, allow the adhesion of mammalian cells via protein nanolayers (PNLs) formed at the interface. However, fluorocarbons and silicones, which have been typically used for liquid cell culture, possess only narrow ranges of physicochemical parameters and have not allowed for a wide variety of cell culturing environment. In this paper, we propose that water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquids (ILs) are a new family of liquid substrate with tunable physicochemical properties and high solvation capabilities. Tetraalkylphosphonium&#8208;based ILs have been identified as non&#8208;cytotoxic ILs, whereon human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were successfully cultured. By reducing the cation charge distribution, or ionicity, via alkyl chain elongation, the interface allowed cell spreading with matured focal contacts. High&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy observations of the PNL formation process suggested that the cation charge distribution significantly altered the protein adsorption dynamics, which were associated with the degree of protein denaturation and the PNL mechanics. Moreover, by exploiting ILs dissolution capability, we fabricated an ion&#8208;gel cell scaffold. This enables us to further identify the significant contribution of bulk subphase mechanics to cellular mechanosensing in liquid&#8208;based culture scaffolds.

         <title>Fast Kinetics Design for Solid&#8208;State Battery Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leap of full cell kinetics at high cathode loading and areal capacity is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. The design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and with a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C.








Abstract
Fast kinetics of solid&#8208;state batteries at the device level is not adequately explored to achieve fast charging and discharging. In this work, a leap forward is achieved for fast kinetics in full cells with high cathode loading and areal capacity. This kinetic improvement is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. In the cathode, the authors&#8217; design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at high current densities of &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, yielding a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C. In the anode, the authors&#8217; design breaks the common rule of the negative correlation between critical C&#8208;rate and the discharge voltage that is observed in most other anodes. The overall design enables the fast cycling of such batteries for over 4000 cycles at room temperature and 5 C charge&#8208;rate. The design principles unveiled by this work help to understand critical kinetic processes in battery devices that limit the fast cycling at high cathode loading and speed up the design of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

In the anode, the authors&#8217; design breaks the common rule of the negative correlation between critical C-rate and the discharge voltage that is observed in most other anodes. The overall design enables the fast cycling of such batteries for over 4000 cycles at room temperature and 5 C charge-rate. The design principles unveiled by this work help to understand critical kinetic processes in battery devices that limit the fast cycling at high cathode loading and speed up the design of high-performance solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concurrent Mechanisms of Hot Electrons and Interfacial Water Molecule Ordering in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the disordered arrangement, water molecules on the solid&#8211;liquid interface exhibit weakened hydrogen bonds accompanied by an ordered distribution under the LSPR effect excited by light illumination, which leads to an improved electron transfer efficiency and proton supply; therefore, enhancing the NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency in NRR.








Abstract
The participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons generated from the non&#8208;radiative decay of localized surface plasmons is an important mechanism for promoting catalytic processes. Herein, another vital mechanism associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, significantly contributing to the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is found. That is to say, the LSPR&#8208;induced strong localized electric fields can weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and regulate the arrangement of water molecules at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The AuCu pentacle nanoparticles with excellent light absorption ability and the capability to generate strong localized electric fields are chosen to demonstrate this effect. The in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations are employed to verify the mechanism at the molecular scale in a nitrogen fixation process. Meanwhile, due to the promoted electron transfer at the interface by the well&#8208;ordered interfacial water, as well as the participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons, the optimal catalyst exhibits excellent performance with an NH3 yield of 52.09 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.82% at &#9472;0.20&#160;V versus RHE. The results are significant for understanding the LSPR effect in catalysis and provide a new approach for regulating the reaction process.

         <title>Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off in Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic doping operation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) renders the understanding of the efficiency roll&#8208;off challenging. Herein, a method for quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. It reveals that singlet&#8208;polaron quenching strongly affects the efficiency roll&#8208;off in singlet&#8208;emitting LECs because of increasing polaron concentration in the p&#8208;n junction with increasing current .








Abstract
Understanding &#8220;efficiency roll&#8208;off&#8221; (i.e., the drop in emission efficiency with increasing current) is critical if efficient and bright emissive technologies are to be rationally designed. Emerging light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) can be cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiently fabricated by ambient&#8208;air printing by virtue of the in situ formation of a p&#8208;n junction doping structure. However, this in situ doping transformation renders a meaningful efficiency analysis challenging. Herein, a method for separation and quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. Specifically, the position of the emissive p&#8208;n junction in common singlet&#8208;exciton emitting LECs is measured to shift markedly with increasing current, and the influence of this shift on the outcoupling efficiency is quantified. It is further verified that the LEC&#8208;characteristic high electrochemical&#8208;doping concentration renders singlet&#8208;polaron quenching (SPQ) significant already at low drive current density, but also that SPQ increases super&#8208;linearly with increasing current, because of increasing polaron density in the p&#8208;n junction region. This results in that SPQ dominates singlet&#8208;singlet quenching for relevant current densities, and significantly contributes to the efficiency roll&#8208;off. This method for deciphering the LEC efficiency roll&#8208;off can contribute to a rational realization of all&#8208;printed LEC devices that are efficient at highluminance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Narrow Dual&#8208;Band Circular Polarized Light Detection for Encrypted Communications and Color Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is described to achieve a high&#8208;performance narrow dual&#8208;band circular polarized photodetector via combining light&#8208;driven cholesteric liquid crystal films with a photodiode&#8208;type photodetector. A super&#8208;high dissymmetry factor of 1.62, left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light detectivity of 6.16 &#215; 1014 Jones, and narrow dual&#8208;band circularly polarized light detection, changing from 535 to 725&#160;nm, with a half&#8208;maximum full width of less than 90&#160;nm is realized.








Abstract
Conventional circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors necessitate several optical elements, posing difficulties in achieving miniature and integrated devices. Recently developed organic CPL detectors require no additional optical elements but usually suffer from low detectivity or low asymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). Here, an organic CPL detector with excellent detectivity and a high g&#8208;factor is fabricated. By employing an inverted quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (IPHJ) structure and incorporating an additional liquid crystal film, a CPL detector with an outstanding g&#8208;factor of 1.62 is developed. Unfavorable charge injection is effectively suppressed by the IPHJ structure, which reduces the dark current of the organic photodetector. Consequently, a left CPL detectivity of 6.16 &#215; 1014 Jones at 640&#160;nm is realized, surpassing all of the latest photodiode&#8208;type CPL detectors. Adopting a liquid crystal film with adjustable wavelengths of selectively reflected light, the hybrid device achieves narrow dual&#8208;band CPL detection, varying from 530 to 640&#160;nm, with a half&#8208;maximum full width below 90&#160;nm. Notably, the device achieves excellent stability of 260 000 on/off cycles without attenuation. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, all these features have rarely been reported in previous work. The CPL detector arrays are also demonstrated for encrypted communications and color imaging.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of PEDOT:PSS Based Electronics Via Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest research in performance enhancement and application scope of PEDOT:PSS/IL composites. A significant feature of ILs that distinguishes them from other additives is their unique ability to harmonize multiple attributes of PEDOT:PSS, encompassing conductivity, deformability, and printability. Armed with these amplified attributes, PEDOT:PSS/IL composites find a multitude of applications across diverse realms of electronics.








Abstract
The conducting polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) offers superior advantages in electronics due to its remarkable combination of high electrical conductivity, excellent biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility, making it an ideal material among electronic skin, health monitoring, and energy harvesting and storage. Nevertheless, pristine PEDOT:PSS films exhibit limitations in terms of both low conductivity and stretchability; while, conventional processing techniques cannot enhance these properties simultaneously, facing the dilemma that highly conductive interconnected PEDOT:PSS domains are susceptible to tensile strain. Via modifying PEDOT:PSS with ionic liquids (ILs), not only a synergistic enhancement of the electrical and mechanical properties can be achieved but also the requirements for the printable bioelectronic are satisfied. In this comprehensive review, the task of providing a thorough examination of the mechanisms and applications of ILs as modifiers for PEDOT:PSS is undertaken. First, the theoretical mechanisms governing the interactions between ILs and PEDOT:PSS are discussed in detail. Then, the enhanced properties and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms achieved through the incorporation of ILs are reviewed. Next, specific applications of ILs&#8208;modified PEDOT:PSS relevant to bioelectronic devices are presented. Last, there is a concise summary and a discussion regarding the opportunities and challenges in this exciting field.

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast and Asymmetric Solvent Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gradients played a pivotal role in membrane technologies, e.g., osmotic energy conversion, desalination, biomimetic actuation, selective separation and more. In these applications, the compositional gradients are of great relevance for successful function implementation, ranging from solvent separation to smart devices. However, the construction of functional gradient in membranes is still challenging both in scale and directions.

Interestingly, GCOMx showed significant filtration performance in simulated kidney dialysis, revealing great potential of GCOMx in bionic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradients played a pivotal role in membrane technologies, e.g., osmotic energy conversion, desalination, biomimetic actuation, selective separation and more. In these applications, the compositional gradients are of great relevance for successful function implementation, ranging from solvent separation to smart devices. However, the construction of functional gradient in membranes is still challenging both in scale and directions. Inspired by the specific function-related, graded porous structures in glomerular filtration membranes, we report here a general approach for constructing gradient covalent organic framework membranes (GCOMx) applying poly (ionic liquid)s as template. With graded distribution of highly porous COF crystals along the membrane, GCOMx exhibited an unprecedented asymmetric solvent transport when applying different membrane sides as the solvent feed surface during filtration, leading to a much-enhanced flux (10&#8764;18 times) of the &#8220;large-to-small&#8221; pore flow comparing to the reverse direction, verified by hydromechanical theoretical calculations. Upon systematic experiments, GCOMx achieved superior permeance in nonpolar (hexane&#8764;260.45 LMH bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and polar (methanol&#8764;175.93 LMH bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) solvents, together with narrow molecular weight cut-off (MWCO, 472&#160;g mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and molecular weight retention onset (MWRO, &amp;lt;182&#160;g mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Heterojunction Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites Which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, we develop a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 hours accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

         <title>Physically &amp; Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for P&#8208;I&#8208;N Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years due to their great potential as the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrode like Au, Ag, Cu, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, we developed a physically &amp; chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) based composite electrode to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in PSCs. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrated the high diffusion barrier of metal Mo ion within the entire device. Structural and morphology characterization also revealed the negligible plastic deformation and halide&#8208;metal reaction during aging when Mo was in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction was further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C60/SnO2/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which was among the highest value for PSCs based on molybdenum electrode. Meanwhile, the device showed negligible performance decay after 2000 hours operation under 1 sun at room temperature, and retained 91% of the initial value after 1300 hours at an elevated temperature of 50&#8211;60&#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opened an effective avenue to all&#8208;round stable electrode design in high&#8208;performance PSCs, while the configuration principle on intrinsically stable electrode equipped with interfacial buffer could further benefit other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>3D Niche&#8208;Inspired Scaffolds as A Stem Cell Delivery System for The Regeneration of The Osteochondral Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The regeneration of the osteochondral unit represents a challenge due to the distinct cartilage and bonny phases present within. Current strategies focus on the development of multi&#8208;phasic scaffolds that recapitulate features of this complex unit and promote the differentiation of implanted bone&#8208;marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs). In doing so, challenges remain from the loss of stemness during in vitro expansion of the cells and the low control over the stem cell activity at the interface with scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. Here, we developed scaffolds inspired by the bone marrow niche that can recapitulate the natural healing process after injury. The construct comprises an internal depot of quiescent BMSCs, mimicking the bone marrow cavity, and an electrospun capsule that &#8220;activates&#8221; the cells to migrate into an outer &#8220;differentiation&#8208;inducing&#8221; 3D printed unit functionalized with TGF&#8208;&#946; and BMP&#8208;2 peptides. In vitro, niche&#8208;inspired scaffolds retained a depot of non&#8208;proliferative cells capable of migrating and proliferating through the electrospun capsule. Invasion of the 3D printed cavity resulted in location&#8208;specific cell differentiation, mineralization, secretion of ALP and GAGs, and genetic upregulation of collagen II and collagen I. In vivo, niche&#8208;inspired scaffolds were biocompatible, promoted tissue formation in rat subcutaneous models, and regeneration of the osteochondral unit in rabbit defect models.

         <title>Advancing Mycotoxin Detection in Food And Feed: Novel Insights from Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The implementation of low&#8208;cost and rapid technologies for the on&#8208;site detection of mycotoxin&#8208;contaminated crops is a promising solution to address the growing concerns of the agri&#8208;food industry. Recently, there have been significant developments in Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the direct detection of mycotoxins in food and feed. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in the utilization of SERS through the successful fabrication of novel nanostructured materials. Various bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches have demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. We uncover that limited studies establish limits of detection (LODs) or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end&#8208;user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on&#8208;site agri&#8208;food applications.

Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. We uncover that limited studies establish limits of detection (LODs) or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end-user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on-site agri-food applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics By Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of local polar heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning are performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, we establish the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, we analyze the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features to energy storage performance and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at an applied electric field of 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity in multiphase dielectrics on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning local polarity heterogeneity.

Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. In this review, we have elucidated the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease were detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions have been widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>Nonlocal Acoustic Moir&#233; Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, we transform the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tuneable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. We also experimentally demonstrate a twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface, and find more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena we observed.

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, we have investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and developed a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe has been utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.

         <title>Autonomous Atmospheric Water Harvesting over a Wide Rh Range Enabled by Super Hygroscopic Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) offers a sustainable strategy to address the global freshwater shortage. However, obtaining sorbents with excellent performance over a wide relative humidity (RH) range and devices with fully autonomous water production remains challenging. Herein, we innovatively converted magnesium chloride (MgCl2) into super hygroscopic magnesium complex (MC), which can effectively solve the problems of salt deliquescence and agglomeration. The MC were then integrated with photothermal aerogels composed of sodium alginate and carbon nanotubes (SA/CNTs) to form composite aerogels, which showed high water uptake over a wide RH range, reaching 5.43 and 0.27&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 at 95% and 20% RH, respectively. The hierarchical porous structure enables the as&#8208;prepared SA/CNTs/MC to exhibit rapid absorption/desorption kinetics with 12 cycles per day at 70% RH, equivalent to a water yield of 10.0 L kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1. To further realize continuous and practical freshwater production, a fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator (AWG) was designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption. Our design provides a promising approach to achieving autonomous, high&#8208;performance, and scalable SAWH.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non&#8208;contact through&#8208;transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non-destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non-contact through-transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sb&#8208;Doped Cs3TbCl6 Nanocrystals for Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Band Green Emission and X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional Sb&#8208;doped lanthanide halide nanocrystals are reported. The origin of the narrower enhanced green PL emission is mainly attributed to highly localized exciton distribution, Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transition process, and effective thermally activated exciton energy transfer. It indicates that the Sb&#8208;doped nanocrystals serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide nanocrystals (NCs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are desirable for lighting, display, and X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, the novel lanthanide&#8208;based halide NCs are committed to designing and optimizing the optical and scintillating properties, so as to unravel the PL origin, exciton dynamics, and optoelectronic applications. Sb&#8208;doped zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3TbCl6 NCs exhibit a green emission with a narrow full width of half maximum of 8.6&#160;nm, and the best PLQY of 48.1% is about three times higher than that of undoped NCs. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that 0D crystalline and electronic structures make the exciton highly localized on [TbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron, which boosts the Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transfer process, thus resulting in bright Tb3+ emission. More importantly, the introduction of Sb3+ not only facilitates the photon absorption transition, but also builds an effective thermally boosting energy transfer channel assisted by [SbCl6]3&#8722;&#8208;induced self&#8208;trapped state, which is responsible for the PL enhancement. The high luminescence efficiency and negligible self&#8208;absorption of the Cs3TbCl6: Sb nanoscintillator enable a more sensitive X&#8208;ray detection response compared with undoped sample. The study opens a new perspective to deeply understand the excited state dynamics of metal halide NCs, which helps to design high&#8208;performance luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>GSH/pH Dual Activatable Cross&#8208;linked and Fluorinated PEI for Cancer Gene Therapy Through Endogenous Iron De&#8208;Hijacking and in Situ ROS Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GSH/pH dual activatable fluorinated PEI system is used to transfect MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD and Cas&#8208;CA IX plasmids into B16&#8208;F10 cancer cells in vitr and in vivo. Decreased intracellular pH caused by the knockdown of CA IX de&#8208;hijacked Fe2+ from ferritin, ignited H2O2 fuel triggered by laser irradiated MTS&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;SOD for enhanced ferroptosis. Thus, achieving cascade&#8208;amplify ROS cytotoxicity by photodynamic&#8208;assisted endogenous chemodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy is limited by insufficient Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for producing lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Although exogenous iron or ROS&#8208;producing drugs can enhance ferroptosis, exploiting endogenous iron (labile iron pool, LIP) stored in ferritin and promoting ROS generation may be safer. Herein, a metal/drug&#8208;free nanomedicine is developed for responsive LIP release and H2O2 generation on the mitochondria membranes, amplifying hydroxyl radical production to enhance ferroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. A glutathione(GSH)/pH dual activatable fluorinated and cross&#8208;linked polyethyleneimine (PEI) with dialdehyde polyethylene glycol layer nanocomplex loaded with MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD (Mitochondria&#8208;targeting&#8208;sequence&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;Superoxide Dismutase) and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;CA IX (Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX)) plasmids (FP@MC) are developed for enhanced ferroptosis through endogenous iron de&#8208;hijacking and in situ ROS amplification. Two plasmids are constructed to knockdown CA IX and translate KillerRed&#8208;SOD recombinant protein specifically on mitochondria membranes, respectively. The CA IX knockdown acidifies the intracellular environment, leading the release of LIP from ferritin as a &#8220;flare&#8221; to initiate endogenous chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD generates H2O2 when irradiated by a 590&#160;nm laser to assist chemodynamic therapy, leading to ROS amplification for mitochondria damage and lipid peroxide accumulation. The combined therapeutic effects aggravate cancer ferroptosis and suppress tumor growth, providing a new paradigm for amplifying ROS and iron ions to promote ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by an Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with high thickness tolerance are realized via introducing an oligomer DY&#8208;TF as third component. Upon addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the host blend is improved and a well&#8208;defined morphology with vertical phase separation is formed, yielding an efficiency of 18.23%, which represents the highest efficiency value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in efficiency. Herein, a ternary strategy in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF is incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component is adopted to break this dilemma. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endow DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF&#8208;based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300 nm thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Multi&#8208;Objective Optimization for Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Materials&#8217; Discovery</title>

         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop workflow combining synthesis, deposition, characterization is used to explore Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S oxide films for efficient water reduction. The workflow narrows down optimal conditions for high photo&#8208;electrocatalytic activity by optimizing for proxy objectives, including bandgap, Cu1+/Cu ratio, and film uniformity. This results in the successful identification of an optimal material composition through multi&#8208;objective constrained optimization techniques.








Abstract
Copper antimony sulfides are regarded as promising catalysts for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting because of their earth abundance and broad light absorption. The unique photoactivity of copper antimony sulfides is dependent on their various crystalline structures and atomic compositions. Here, a closed&#8208;loop workflow is built, which explores Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S compositional space to optimize its photo&#8208;electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, by integrating a high&#8208;throughput robotic platform, characterization techniques, and machine learning (ML) optimization workflow. The multi&#8208;objective optimization model discovers optimum experimental conditions after only nine cycles of integrated experiments&#8211;machine learning loop. Photocurrent testing at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) confirms the expected correlation between the materials&#8217; properties and photocurrent. An optimum photocurrent of &#8722;186&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 is observed on Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S in the ratio of 9:45:46 in the form of single&#8208;layer coating on F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) glass with a corresponding bandgap of 1.85&#160;eV and 63.2% Cu1+/Cu species content. The targeted intelligent search reveals a nonobvious CuSbS composition that exhibits 2.3 times greater activity than baseline results from random sampling.

         <title>Electrochemically Responsive 3D Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method using carbon nanotube&#8208;tin composites to develop electrochromic reconfigurable three&#8208;dimensional&#160;microstructures. These microstructures respond to external stimuli and can change the shape/color continuously with low&#8208;power electric input through an electrochemical process. The method enables parallel production of thousands of microstructures, while their design is optimized for large strokes and high cyclability using finite element analysis.








Abstract
Responsive nanomaterials are being developed to create new unique functionalities such as switchable colors and adhesive properties or other programmable features in response to external stimuli. While many existing examples rely on changes in temperature, humidity, or pH, this study aims to explore an alternative approach relying on simple electric input signals. More specifically, 3D electrochromic architected microstructures are developed using carbon nanotube&#8211;Tin (Sn) composites that can be reconfigured by lithiating Sn with low power electric input (&#8776;50 nanowatts). These microstructures have a continuous, regulated, and non&#8208;volatile actuation determined by the extent of the electrochemical lithiation process. In addition, this proposed fabrication process relies only on batch lithographic techniques, enabling the parallel production of thousands of 3D microstructures. Structures with a 30&#8211;97% change in open&#8208;end area upon actuation are demonstrated and the importance of geometric factors in the response and structural integrity of 3D architected microstructures during electrochemical actuation is highlighted.

         <title>A Wearable Touch&#8208;Activated Device Integrated with Hollow Microneedles for Continuous Sampling and Sensing of Dermal Interstitial Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully&#8208;integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device is developed for continuous sampling and electrochemical analysis of interstitial fluid. The elastic self&#8208;recovery of the vacuum generation system enables a wide range of negative pressures and extraction rates. The developed device can successfully detect glucose and pH levels and holds the potential for continuous sensing of multiple biomarkers in extracted interstitial fluid.








Abstract
Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is emerging as a rich source of biomarkers that complements conventional biofluids such as blood and urine. However, the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited owing to the challenges associated with extraction. The implementation of microneedle&#8208;based wearable devices that can extract dermal ISF in a pain&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use manner has attracted growing attention in recent years. Here, a fully integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device based on a laser&#8208;drilled hollow microneedle (HMN) patch for continuous sampling and sensing of dermal ISF is introduced. The developed platform can produce and maintain the required vacuum pressure (as low as &#8776; &#8722;53&#160;kPa) to collect adequate volumes of ISF (&#8776;2&#160;&#181;L needle&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) for medical applications. The vacuum system can be activated through a one&#8208;touch finger operation. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of microneedle array size, vacuum pressure, and extraction duration on collected ISF. The capability of the proposed platform for continuous health monitoring is further demonstrated by the electrochemical detection of glucose and pH levels of ISF in animal models. This HMN&#8208;based system provides an alternative tool to the existing invasive techniques for ISF collection and sensing for medical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Integrated Force Sensor using 3D Printed Spring&#8208;Composed Fabry&#8208;Perot Cavities with a High Precision Down to Tens of Piconewton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber&#8208;integrated force probe using a spring FP cavity for general&#8208;uses is proposed. The force&#8208;sensitivity and resolution reach (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, representing the highest precisions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes. Typically, it uses the sensor to explore the micro&#8208;scale nonlinear problems in fluid mechanics. It anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe will generate significant impacts for accurate force&#8208;detection.








Abstract
Developing microscale sensors capable of force measurements down to the scale of piconewtons is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications. To date, advanced instrumentations such as atomic force microscopes and other specifically developed micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems face challenges such as high cost, complex detection systems and poor electromagnetic compatibility. Here, it presents the unprecedented design and 3D printing of general fiber&#8208;integrated force sensors using spring&#8208;composed Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities. It calibrates these microscale devices employing varied&#8208;diameter &#956;$\umu$ m&#8208;scale silica particles as standard weights. The force sensitivity and resolution reach values of (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, which are the best resolutions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes so far. It also measured the non&#8208;linear airflow force distributions produced from a nozzle with an orifice of 2 &#956;$\umu$ m, which matches well with the full&#8208;sized simulations. With further customization of their geometries and materials, it anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe can well extend to many other applications such as air/fluidic turbulences sensing, micro&#8208;manipulations, and biological sensing.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Metal&#8208;Grid Electrodes for Efficient Parallel&#8208;Connected Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The unfavorable conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide electrodes restricts the development of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide electrodes are developed based on a photolithography technique. Such electrodes with greatly enhanced conductivity and low&#8208;height metal steps help increase device performance and mitigate performance loss while upscaling cell area.








Abstract
The limited conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide (TCO) greatly restricts the further performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for large&#8208;area devices. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (BMG ITO) electrodes are developed to minimize the power loss caused by the undesirable high sheet resistance of TCOs. By burying 140&#8208;nm&#8208;thick metal grids into ITO using a photolithography technique, the sheet resistance of ITO is reduced from 15.0 to 2.7 &#937; sq&#8722;1. The metal step of BMG over ITO has a huge impact on the charge carrier transport in PSCs. The PSCs using BMG ITO with a low metal step deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly better than that of their counterparts with higher metal steps. Moreover, compared with the pristine ITO&#8208;based PSCs, the BMG ITO&#8208;based PSCs show a smaller PCE decrease when scaling up the active area of devices. The parallel&#8208;connected large&#8208;area PSCs with an active area of 102.8 mm2 reach a PCE of 22.5%. The BMG ITO electrodes are also compatible with the fabrication of inverted&#8208;structure PSCs and organic solar cells. The work demonstrates the great efficacy of improving the conductivity of TCO by BMG and opens up a promising avenue for constructing highly efficient large&#8208;area PSCs.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Smart Microneedles with &#8220;Offensive and Defensive&#8221; Effects for Intervertebral Disc Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new strategy for intervertebral disc repair. The high&#8208;strength smart microneedles are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects, and ultimately promoting the repair of intervertebral disc.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a global public health issue. The injury of annulus fibrosus (AF) caused by acupuncture or discectomy can trigger IVDD again. However, there is currently no suitable method for treating AF injury. In this study, the high&#8208;strength smart microneedles (MNs) which can penetrate the AF tissue through a local and minimally invasive method, and achieve remote control of speeded&#8208;up release of the drug and hyperthermia by the Near Infrared is developed. The PDA/GelMA composite MNs loaded with diclofenac sodium are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance the defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the synergistic treatment of photothermal therapy and anti&#8208;inflammation effectively reduces inflammation, inhibits cell apoptosis, and promotes the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo experiments show that the MNs mitigate the inflammatory response, promote ECM deposition, reduce the level of apoptosis, and restore the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc (IVD) in rats. Overall, this high&#8208;strength smart MNs display promising &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects that can provide a new strategy for IVD repair.

         <title>Aramid Nanodielectrics for Ultraconformal Transparent Electronic Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) with self&#8208;delaminated characteristics are developed, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. Compliant epidermal electrodes and ultraconformal carbon nanotube transistors based on ANDs are further demonstrated with superior performance.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics require minimal thicknesses and decent transparency for conformal contact, imperceptible wearing, and visual aesthetics. It is challenging to search for advanced ultrathin dielectrics capable of supporting the active components while maintaining bending softness, easy handling, and wafer&#8208;scale processability. Here, self&#8208;delaminated aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) are demonstrated, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. As demonstrated, compliant epidermal electrodes comprising silver nanowires and ANDs can successfully record high&#8208;quality electromyogram signals with low motion artifacts and satisfying sweat and water resistance. Furthermore, ANDs can serve as both substrates and dielectrics in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with a merely 160&#8208;nm thickness, which can be operated within 4&#160;V with on/off ratios of 1.4 &#177; 0.5 &#215; 105, mobilities of 39.9 &#177; 2.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and negligible hysteresis. The ultraconformal FETs can function properly when wrapped around human hair without any degradation in performance.

         <title>Growth, Distribution, and Photosynthesis of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii in 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying spatiotemporal cell growth within engineered living materials is key to identifying shape parameters for improved material functionality. In photosynthetic microalgae&#8208;based living materials, both carbon source availability and light penetration&#160;are found to be limiting factors for cell growth. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, photosynthetic living materials are designed and printed for increased CO2 consumption.








Abstract
Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, this work investigates the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) in three&#8208;dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, this work successfully designs and prints photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of Organic Electronic Materials Enabled by Hybrid Top&#8208;Down/Bottom&#8208;Up Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Top&#8208;down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; methods are combined to facilitate the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. A dataset of 117K synthesized molecules is curated and used as a building block library. Statistical models are trained on this dataset, enabling accurate prediction of excited state properties. This approach allows for efficient screening of over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission.








Abstract
The high&#8208;throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly of user&#8208;defined fragments based on known synthetic templates.

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Top-down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; methods are combined to facilitate the fragment-based discovery of organic electronic materials. A dataset of 117K synthesized molecules is curated and used as a building block library. Statistical models are trained on this dataset, enabling accurate prediction of excited state properties. This approach allows for efficient screening of over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top-down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; assembly of user-defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time-consuming approaches requiring significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Based Stable and Stretchable Zn&#8208;Ion Battery for Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable and stretchable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery is developed by utilizing a dendrite&#8208;free liquid metal@Zn anode, which can be well&#8208;integrated with a liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous sensor, Joule heater, and wireless charging device for smart multifunctional electronic textiles.








Abstract
Electronic textiles harmoniously interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, offering tremendous interest in smart wearable electronics. However, their wide application faces challenges due to the lack of stable and stretchable power electrodes/devices with multifunctional design. Herein, an intrinsically stretchable liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous anode for a stable Zn&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) is reported. Benefiting from the liquid feature and superior deformability of the liquid metal, optimized Zn ion concentration distribution and Zn (002) deposition behavior are observed, which result in dendrite&#8208;free performance even under stretching. With a strain of 50%, the ZIB maintains a high capacity of 139.8 mAh cm&#8722;3 (corresponding to 83.0% of the initial value) after 300 cycles, outperforming bare Zn fiber&#8208;based ZIB. The fibrous ZIB seamlessly integrates with the sensor, Joule heater, and wirelessly charging device, which provides a stable power supply for human signal monitoring and personal thermal management, holding promise for the application of wearable multifunctional electronic textiles.

         <title>Synergetic Sn Incorporation&#8208;Zn Substitution in Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution strategy is proposed to develop a superior copper&#8208;based sulfide anode in Na&#8208;ion battery, which exhibits high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, ultrastable cycling performance, superior rate capability, and ultrafast charging feature. Furthermore, the critical roles of Sn and Zn in synergistically promoting the Na&#8208;ion storage performance are clarified.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation&#8208;Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper&#8208;based sulfides. First, Na&#8208;ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy&#8208;based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied by sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na&#8208;ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote Na&#8208;ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve mechanical strain&#8211;stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow copper&#8208;based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8776;560 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8776;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&#8722;1, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8776;4 s per charging with &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1 input). This work provides in&#8208;depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi&#8208;cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.

         <title>Ag Nanoparticle&#8208;Induced Surface Chloride Immobilization Strategy Enables Stable Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ formation of AgCl by the combination of free Cl&#8722; with oxidized Ag nanoparticles in the presence of an electric field effectively repel free Cl&#8722; through strong common&#8208;ion repulsive effect. As&#8208;prepared NiFe&#8208;LDH@Ag exhibits superior corrosion resistance and unprecedented stability at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for more than 5000&#160;h in alkaline saline electrolyte.








Abstract
Although hydrogen gas (H2) storage might enable offshore renewable energy to be stored at scale, the commercialization of technology for H2 generation by seawater electrolysis depends upon the development of methods that avoid the severe corrosion of anodes by chloride (Cl&#8722;) ions. Here, it is revealed that the stability of an anode used for seawater splitting can be increased by more than an order of magnitude by loading Ag nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. In experiments, an optimized NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH)@Ag electrode displays stable operation at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline saline electrolyte and seawater for over 5000 and 2500&#160;h, respectively. The impressive long&#8208;term durability is more than 20 times that of an unmodified NiFe&#8208;LDH anode. Meticulous characterization and simulation reveals that in the presence of an applied electric field, free Cl&#8722; ions react with oxidized Ag nanoparticles to form stable AgCl species, giving rise to the formation of a Cl&#8722;&#8208;free layer near the anode surface. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, it is anticipated that the proposed strategy to immobilize chloride ions on the surface of an anode has the potential to become a crucial technology to control corrosion during large&#8208;scale electrolysis of seawater to produce hydrogen.

         <title>Fe Cluster Modified Co9S8 Heterojunction: Highly Efficient Photoelectrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting and Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, outstanding photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts are successfully synthesized by thermal annealing of polydopamine coated CdS and ZIF&#8208;67. Additionally, based on the spatial confinement of the N&#8208;doped carbon skeleton and the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, the Co9S8&#8208;Fe heterojunction substantially facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and further enhances the photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Designing bifunctional low&#8208;cost photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts for converting solar and electric energy into hydrogen energy remains a huge challenge. Herein, a heterojunction (Fe cluster modified Co9S8 loaded on carbon nanotubes, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT)&#160;for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good electronic conductivity and spatial confinement of the carbon skeleton, as well as the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 150&#160;mV for OER and 135&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Upon light irradiation, holes and electrons are generated in the valence band and conduction band of the Co9S8, respectively. Part of the charges are transferred to the interface to facilitate the catalytic reaction, while the remaining are transferred by the electrode. When working as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the performance can reach 1.33&#160;V at under light conditions, which is significantly better than 1.52&#160;V in a dark environment. Theoretical calculations revealed lowered Gibbs free energy (&#8710;GH*) of the heterojunction with the effect of Fe modification of Co9S8. This work sheds a new light in designing novel photoelectrochemical materials to convert solar and electric energy into chemical energy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing bifunctional low-cost photo-assisted electrocatalysts for converting solar and electric energy into hydrogen energy remains a huge challenge. Herein, a heterojunction (Fe cluster modified Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; loaded on carbon nanotubes, Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe@CNT)&#160;for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good electronic conductivity and spatial confinement of the carbon skeleton, as well as the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe@CNT exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 150&#160;mV for OER and 135&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Upon light irradiation, holes and electrons are generated in the valence band and conduction band of the Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Part of the charges are transferred to the interface to facilitate the catalytic reaction, while the remaining are transferred by the electrode. When working as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the performance can reach 1.33&#160;V at under light conditions, which is significantly better than 1.52&#160;V in a dark environment. Theoretical calculations revealed lowered Gibbs free energy (&#8710;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;*) of the heterojunction with the effect of Fe modification of Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. This work sheds a new light in designing novel photoelectrochemical materials to convert solar and electric energy into chemical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uracil Induced Simultaneously Strengthening Grain Boundaries and Interfaces Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecular uracil additive is developed to passivate the defects of the perovskite film and enhance the interface binding force between perovskite film and substrate. The device delivers a champion efficiency of 24.23%. The device exhibits superior operational stability maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after tracking for 6000 h at the maximum power point.








Abstract
The operational stability is a huge obstacle to further commercialization of perovskite solar cells. To address this critical issue, in this work, uracil is introduced as a &#8220;binder&#8221; into the perovskite film to simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. Uracil can efficiently passivate defects and strengthen grain boundaries to enhance the stability of perovskite films. Moreover, the uracil also strengthens the interface between the perovskite and the Tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer to increase the binding force. The uracil&#8208;modified devices deliver a champion PCE of 24.23% (certificated 23.19%) with negligible hysteresis at active area of 0.0625 cm2. In particular, the optimal device exhibits over 90% of its initial PCE after tracking for &#8776;6000 h at its maximum power point under continuous light, indicating its superior operational stability. Moreover, the devices also show great reproducibility in both PCE and operational stability.

         <title>An Industrially Applicable Passivation Strategy for Significantly Improving Cyclability of Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrially applicable passivation strategy of zinc plating by a simple dipping treatment is adopted to grow trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) as artificial interphases for Zn metal anodes. The facile preparation process and superior electrochemical performance of TCCF@Zn offer an exciting possibility for the practicability of metallic zinc anodes in aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
The cycling instability of metallic Zn anodes hinders the practicability of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, though aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries may be the most credible alternative technology for future electrochemical energy storage applications. Commercially available trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) are successfully employed as robust artificial interphases on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Fabricated through a simple immersion method, the TCCF&#8208;protected Zn (TCCF@Zn) electrode enables a superlow nucleation overpotential for Zn plating of 6.9&#160;mV under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1600 cycles in Zn||Cu asymmetric cells and superior cyclability in symmetric Zn||Zn batteries at 0.2, 2, and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2500&#160;h and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1200&#160;h. More importantly, the TCCF@Zn||V2O5 full cell exhibits a specific capacity of 118.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 53.4% at 3 A g&#8722;1 for 3000 cycles, which is considerably larger than that of the pristine Zn||V2O5 full cell (59.7 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 25.7%). This study demonstrates a highly efficient and low&#8208;cost surface modification strategy derived from an industrially applicable trivalent chromium passivation technique aimed at obtaining dendrite&#8208;free ZMAs with high reversibility for practical Zn batteries in the near future.

         <title>Surface Energy Engineering of Buried Interface for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>

The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects seriously impair the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, a novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant HFSTA on the surface of the TiO2 substrate. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation and stress relief, PCE of 25.03% is achieved on champion device along with improved stability.








Abstract
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects (e.g., O vacancies, O&#8211;H) in the TiO2 electron transport layer results in high surface energy, which is detrimental to effective carrier extraction and seriously impairs the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant of heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) on the surface of the TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the HFSTA&#8208;TiO2 is less prone to form O vacancies, leading to lower surface energy, thus improving the carrier&#8208;extraction efficiency. The experimental results show that superior perovskite film is obtained due to the reduced heterogeneous nucleation sites and improved crystallization process on the modified TiO2. Furthermore, the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA considerably relieve the compressive stresses at the buried interface. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation, and stress relief, a champion PCE up to 25.03% is achieved. The device without encapsulation sustains 92.2% of its initial PCE after more than 2500&#160;h storage under air ambient with relative humidity of 25&#8211;30%. The SEE of a buried interface paves a new way toward high&#8208;efficiency, stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Anodic Oxidation Reactions in the Performance Evaluation of High&#8208;Rate CO2/CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation, e.g., misestimation of the Faradaic efficiency, are elaborated. It is revealed that dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a shift of anodic potentials, but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst.








Abstract
The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) approach appears to be the most promising technique to realize the high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis, however there are major challenges related to the crossover of ions and liquid products from cathode to anode via the membrane and the concomitant anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this perspective, by combining experimental and theoretical analyses, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation are investigated. First, the crossover behavior of several typical liquid products through an anion&#8208;exchange membrane is analyzed. Subsequently, two instructive examples (introducing formate or ethanol oxidation during electrolysis) reveals that the dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a slight shift of anodic potentials (i.e., change of competing reactions), but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst. Anodic oxidation of liquid products can also cause either over&#8208; or under&#8208;estimation of the Faradaic efficiency, leading to an inaccurate assessment of overall performance. To comprehensively understand fundamentals of AORs, a theoretical guideline with hierarchical indicators is further developed to predict and regulate the possible AORs in an electrolyzer. The perspective concludes by giving some suggestions on rigorous performance evaluations for high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis in an MEA&#8208;based setup.

         <title>Lipid&#8208;Centric Design of Plasma Membrane&#8208;Mimicking Nanocarriers for Targeted Chemotherapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release.








Abstract
The plasma membranes (PM) of mammalian cells contain diverse lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates that are important for systemic recognition and communication in health and disease. Cell membrane coating technology that imparts unique properties of natural plasma membranes to the surface of encapsulated nanoparticles is thus becoming a powerful platform for drug delivery, immunomodulation, and vaccination. However, current coating methods fail to take full advantage of the natural systems because they disrupt the complex and functionally essential features of PMs, most notably the chemical diversity and compositional differences of lipids in two leaflets of the PM. Herein, a new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier systems for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release. This pilot study provides new insight into the rational design and optimization of nanocarriers for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs and lays the foundation for further customization of cell membrane&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers through systematic incorporation of other components.

         <title>Biotoxicity of Halide Perovskites in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the fast&#8208;paced development of perovskite solar cells as a potential silicon&#8208;based solar cell replacement, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the environmental and health safety. This work assesses the biotoxicity of heavy metals in perovskite materials, providing insights into understanding their potential risks and guiding further investigations in mammalian systems and environmental sustainability of perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are crystalline semiconductors with exceptional optoelectronic properties, rapidly developing toward large&#8208;scale applications. Lead (II) (Pb2+) is the core element used to prepare halide perovskites. Pb2+ can displace key 2+ elements, including calcium, zinc and iron, that regulate vital physiological functions. Sn2+ can replace Pb2+ within the perovskite structure and, if accidentally dispersed in the environment, it readily oxidizes to Sn4+, which is compatible with physiological functions and thus potentially safe. The 3+ salt bismuth (III) (Bi3+) is also potentially safe for the same reason and useful to prepare double perovskites. Here, this work studies the biotoxicity of Pb, Sn, and Bi perovskites in mice for the first time. This work analyses histopathology and growth of mice directly exposed to perovskites and investigate the development of their offspring generation. This study provides the screening of organs and key physiological functions targeted by perovskite exposure to design specific studies in mammalians.

         <title>High&#8208;Stroke, High&#8208;Output&#8208;Force, Fabric&#8208;Lattice Artificial Muscles for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles with large contraction ratios, high output forces, and diverse configurations is proposed by connecting a group of fabric chambers and layers into a lattice. This artificial muscle can be designed with desired performance and configuration to enable high&#8208;performance soft robots, including the powerful robotic elbow, the assistive shoulder exosuit, and the adaptive soft gripper.








Abstract
Artificial muscles, providing safe and close interaction between humans and machines, are essential in soft robotics. However, their insufficient deformation, output force, or configurability usually limits their applications. Herein, this work presents a class of lightweight fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles (FAMs) that are pneumatically actuated with large contraction ratios (up to 87.5%) and considerable output forces (up to a load of 20&#160;kg, force&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of over 250). The developed FAMs consist of a group of active air chambers that are zigzag connected into a lattice through passive connecting layers. The geometry of these fabric components is programmable to convert the in&#8208;plane lattice of FAMs into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations (e.g., arched and cylindrical) capable of linear/radial contraction. This work further demonstrates that FAMs can be configured for various soft robotic applications, including the powerful robotic elbow with large motion range and high load capability, the well&#8208;fitting assistive shoulder exosuit that can reduce muscle activity during abduction, and the adaptive soft gripper that can grasp irregular objects. These results show the unique features and broad potential of FAMs for high&#8208;performance soft robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing and Capacitive&#8208;Matched Triboelectric Implants Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator using a high&#8208;dielectric composite not only improves the output of the device, but also improves the connectivity between the energy harvester and the circuit, enabling the semipermanent use and miniaturization of implantable medical devices. These triboelectric implants provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.








Abstract
In implantable bioelectronics, which aim for semipermanent use of devices, biosafe energy sources and packaging materials to protect devices are essential elements. However, research so far has been conducted in a direction where they cannot coexist. Here, the development of capacitance&#8208;matched triboelectric implants driven is reported by ultrasound under 500&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 safe intensity and realize a battery&#8208;free, miniatured, and wireless neurostimulator with full titanium (Ti) packaging. The triboelectric implant with high dielectric composite, which has ultralow output impedance, can efficiently deliver sufficient power to generate the stimulation pulse without an energy&#8208;storing battery, despite ultrasound attenuation due to the Ti, and has the highest energy transmission efficiency among those reported so far. In vivo study using a rat model demonstrated that the proposed device system is an effective solution for relieving urinary symptoms. These achievements provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.

         <title>Dendritic Nanomedicine with Boronate Bonds for Augmented Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a feasible strategy of integrating epirubicin (Epi) and NLG919 within a target group&#8208;shieldable dendritic delivery system. Epi is served as a chemotherapeutic drug and a robust immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent, and NLG919 inhibited IDO1 activity to downregulate the generation of kynurenine (Kyn), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and reeducation of the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Unsatisfied tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and a complicated immunosuppressive microenvironment diminish the immune response rate and the therapeutic effect. Surface modification of these drugs with target ligands can promote their cellular internalization, but the modified drugs may be subjected to unexpected immune recognition and clearance. Herein, a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group&#8208;shieldable dendritic nanomedicine that integrates an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent (epirubicin, Epi) and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxgenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor (NLG919) is reported for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This NLG919&#8208;loaded Epi&#8208;conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L&#8208;tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a feasible strategy of integrating epirubicin (Epi) and NLG919 within a target group-shieldable dendritic delivery system. Epi is served as a chemotherapeutic drug and a robust immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing agent, and NLG919 inhibited IDO1 activity to downregulate the generation of kynurenine (Kyn), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and reeducation of the tumor immune microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and a complicated immunosuppressive microenvironment diminish the immune response rate and the therapeutic effect. Surface modification of these drugs with target ligands can promote their cellular internalization, but the modified drugs may be subjected to unexpected immune recognition and clearance. Herein, a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group-shieldable dendritic nanomedicine that integrates an immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing agent (epirubicin, Epi) and an indoleamine 2,3-dioxgenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor (NLG919) is reported for tumor chemo-immunotherapy. This NLG919-loaded Epi-conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi-DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi-DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi-DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L-tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo-immunotherapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amphibious Polymer Materials with High Strength and Superb Toughness in Various Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate nanostructure design with nanophase separation and crystalline domains leads to an amphibious polymer material with outstanding mechanical performance in both hydrated and dehydrated states, affording a hydrogel with a toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and a plastic with a toughness of up to 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. In addition, the hydrogel exhibits excellent stability in acidic, alkaline, and saline aqueous environments.








Abstract
Herein, the fabrication of amphibious polymer materials with outstanding mechanical performances, both underwater and in the air is reported. A polyvinyl alcohol/poly(2&#8208;methoxyethylacrylate) (PVA/PMEA) composite with multiscale nanostructures is prepared by combining solvent exchange and thermal annealing strategies, which contributes to nanophase separation with rigid PVA&#8208;rich and soft PMEA&#8208;rich phases and high&#8208;density crystalline domains of PVA chains, respectively. Benefiting from the multiscale nanostructure, the PVA/PMEA hydrogel demonstrates excellent stability in harsh (such as acidic, alkaline, and saline) aqueous solutions, as well as superior mechanical behavior with a breaking strength of up to 34.8&#160;MPa and toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Dehydrating the PVA/PMEA hydrogel results in an extremely robust plastic with a breaking strength of 65.4&#160;MPa and toughness of 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. This study provides a promising phase&#8211;structure engineering route for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer materials for complex load&#8208;bearing environments.

         <title>Photoinduced Nonvolatile Memory Transistor Based on Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Incorporating Fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable Transistors. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors show remarkable photoresponse, stable storage&#8208;erase cycles and competitive retention performance. Importantly, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistor with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior is described.








Abstract
Perovskites field&#8208;effect transistors (PeFETs) have been intensively investigated for their application in detector and synapse. However, synapse based on PeFETs is still very difficult to integrate excellent charge carrier transporting ability, photosensitivity, and nonvolatile memory effects into one device, which is very important for developing bionic electronic devices and edge computing. Here, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8209;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable PeFETs. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors display the hole mobility over 0.3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, high repeatability, and operational stability. Meanwhile, the derived photo memory devices show remarkable photoresponse, with a switching ratio higher than 105, high visible light responsivity (&gt;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1), and stable storage&#8208;erase cycles, as well as competitive retention performance (104&#160;s). The photoinduced memory behavior can be benefiting from the insulating nature of quantum&#8208;well in 2D perovskite under dark and its excellent light sensitivity. The excellent photo memory behaviors have been maintained after 40 days in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistors with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior (16 distinct states) is described by controlling incident light pulse. This work provides broader attention toward 2D perovskite and optoelectronic application.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of High&#8208;Harmonic Generation with Resonance&#8208;Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. This general concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical harmonics.








Abstract
High&#8208;index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry&#8208;dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here, this limitation is tackled by introducing an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light&#8208;matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. Resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone&#8208;like nanoresonators, which are made of germanium and support high&#8208;quality optical resonances in the mid&#8208;IR spectral range. The concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical&#160;harmonics.

The dual&#8208;functional sensory device exhibits efficient molecular packing and excellent free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, resulting in a high output power density of over 94 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for OPVs, under dim indoor illumination (LED 1000 lx). Moreover, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed device by developing a single&#8208;pixel image sensor for practical indoor operation in commercial settings.








Abstract
The development of organic&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies for the indoor Internet of Things market, which relies on ambient energy sources, has increased, with organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) considered promising candidates for sustainable indoor electronic devices. However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi&#8208;component photoactive structure to develop a self&#8208;powering dual&#8208;functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, a single&#8208;pixel image sensor is demonstrated as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high&#8208;performance OPV&#8208;OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential, which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.

This study uses a multi-component photoactive structure to develop a self-powering dual-functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free-charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, a single-pixel image sensor is demonstrated as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high-performance OPV-OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential, which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermochromic Printable and Multicolor Polymeric Composite Based on Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermochromic composite consisting of a 2D perovskite and a nonionic block copolymer is developed. It exhibits excellent performance, allowing 80% transmittance modulation in the visible range, taking only a few seconds to switch from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa) and providing a wide range of colors when heated at 70&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK&#8208;based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance &gt; 80%) at room temperature to a colored state (transmittance &lt; 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa). X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calometry, rheological, and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in the material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, the system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions. The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#160;&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite. Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Co&#8208;Expressed Nanomedicine for Anti&#8208;Metastasis Tumor Therapy by Up&#8208;Regulating Cellular Oxidative Stress and Depleting Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor invasion and metastasis are the main causes of death in cancer patients. To overcome the limitations of current anti&#8208;tumor metastasis therapy, a novel multiple&#8208;enzymes co&#8208;expressed cholesterol oxidase loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme that can destroy the lipid raft structure and inhibiting lamellipodia formation through a cholesterol depletion and oxidative stress up&#8208;regulation strategy, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, is constructed.








Abstract
Tumor cells movement and migration are inseparable from the integrity of lipid rafts and the formation of lamellipodia, and lipid rafts are also a prerequisite for the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, destroying the lipid rafts is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, a multi&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expressed nanomedicine: cholesterol oxidase (CHO) loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Co&#9472;PN3 SA/CHO) that can up&#8208;regulate cellular oxidative stress, disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, and inhibit lamellipodia formation to induce anti&#8208;metastasis tumor therapy, is developed. In this process, Co&#9472;PN3 SA can catalyze oxygen (O2)&#160;and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidase&#8208;like and Fenton&#8208;like properties. The doping of P atoms optimizes the adsorption process of the intermediate at the active site and enhances the ROS generation properties of nanomedicine. Meantime, O2 produced by catalase&#8208;like catalysis can combine with excess cholesterol to generate more H2O2 under CHO catalysis, achieving enhanced oxidative damage to tumor cells. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion in tumor cells also disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts and inhibits the formation of lamellipodia, greatly inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. This strategy by up&#8208;regulating cellular oxidative stress and depleting cellular cholesterol constructs a new idea for anti&#8208;metastasis&#8211;oriented cancer therapy strategies.

         <title>Photoelectrons Sequentially Regulate Antibacterial Activity and Osseointegration of Titanium Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au&#8208;RE/TiO2 coating of titanium implant can generate electron under near infrared light (NIR) illumination. In vivo and in vitro explorations prove the photoelectron&#8208;responsive titanium implants can sequentially regulate antibacterial activity and osseointegration through upconversion, providing a new solution for those patients with post&#8208;implantation infection and poor osseointegration.








Abstract
Titanium implants are widely used ; however, implantation occasionally fails due to infections during the surgery or poor osseointegration after the surgery. To solve the problem, an intelligent functional surface on titanium implant that can sequentially eradicate bacteria biofilm at the initial period and promote osseointegration at the late period of post&#8208;surgery time is designed. Such surfaces can be excited by near infrared light (NIR), with rare earth nanoparticles to upconvert the NIR light to visible range and adsorb by Au nanoparticles, supported by titanium oxide porous film on titanium implants. Under NIR irradiation, the implant converts the energy of phonon to hot electrons and lattice vibrations, while the former flows directly to the contact substance or partially reacts with the surrounding to generate reactive oxygen species, and the latter leads to the local temperature increase. The biofilm or microbes on the implant surface can be eradicated by NIR treatment in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the surface exhibits superior biocompatibility for cell survival, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, which provides the foundation for osseointegration. In vivo implantation experiments demonstrate osseointegration is also promoted. This work thus demonstrates NIR&#8208;generated electrons can sequentially eradicate biofilms and regulate the osteogenic process, providing new solutions to fabricate efficient implant surfaces.

         <title>A Janus&#8208;ROS Healing System Promoting Infectious Bone Regeneration via Sono&#8208;Epigenetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;reactive oxygen species healing system based on alendronate&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework sonosensitizer is developed, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation for infectious bone regeneration.








Abstract
Elimination of bacterial infections and simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation are highly required for infectious bone diseases. Massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cells, while low ROS concentrations as a molecular signal can regulate cellular fate. In this study, a Janus&#8208;ROS healing system is developed for infectious bone regeneration. An alendronate (ALN)&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sonosensitizer is prepared, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation. In the presence of zirconium&#8211;phosphate coordination, the ALN&#8208;mediated porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (HN25) with a proper defect has great sonodynamic antibacterial efficiency (98.97%, 15&#160;min) and bone&#8208;targeting ability. Notably, under low&#8208;power ultrasound irradiation, HN25 can increase the chromatin accessibility of ossification&#8208;related genes and FOXO1 to promote bone repair through low ROS concentrations. Animal models of paravertebral infection, fracture with infection, and osteomyelitis demonstrate that HN25 successfully realizes the targeted and potent repair of various infectious bone tissues through rapid MRSA elimination, inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting bone regeneration. The results show that high catalytic efficiency and bioactive MOF can be constructed using pharmaceutical&#8208;mediated defect engineering. The Janus&#8208;ROS treatment is also a promising therapeutic mode for infectious tissue regeneration.

         <title>Tandem Photon Avalanches for Various Nanoscale Emitters with Optical Nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;Order through Interfacial Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem photon avalanches (TPA) strategy for various emitters with huge optical nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;order through interfacial energy transfer is presented. The avalanched 800&#8208;nm Tm3+ emission non&#8208;radiatively pumps Er3+ to exhibit bright PA at a low threshold. Efficient avalanching behaviors are also observed for Ho3+, Ce3+, and blue emission of Tm3+ through the TPA mechanism.








Abstract
Photon avalanche has received continuous attention owing to its superior nonlinear dynamics and promising advanced applications. However, its impact is limited due to the intrinsic energy levels as well as the harsh requirements for the composites and sizes of doped materials. Here, with a universal mechanism named tandem photon avalanche (TPA), giant optical nonlinear response up to 41st&#8208;order in erbium ions, one of the most important lanthanide emitters, has been achieved on the nanoscale through interfacial energy transfer process. After capturing energy directly from the avalanched energy state 3H4 of Tm3+ (800&#8208;nm emission), erbium ions also exhibit bright green and red PA emissions with intensities comparable to that of Tm3+ at a low excitation threshold (7.1 kWcm&#8722;2). Using the same strategy, effective PA looping cycles are successfully activated in Ce3+ and Ho3+. Additionally, Yb3+&#8208;mediated networks are constructed to further propagate PA effects to lowly&#8208;doped Tm3+, enabling 475&#8208;nm PA emission. The newly proposed TPA strategy provides a facile route for generating photon avalanche not only from erbium ions but also from various emitters in multilayered core&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Piezoionic High Performance Hydrogel Generator and Active Protein Absorber via Microscopic Porosity and Phase Blending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potent piezoionic electricity is achieved in a porous and phase hybrid hydrogel, taking advantage of the engineered differences in flow velocities between sodium and chloride ions upon mechanical stimuli. Dynamic voltages up to 600&#160;mV and effective protein adsorptions are obtained. Potential application in nerve function adjustment, mimetic tactile sensors, hydrogel P/N heterojunction building, and enzyme immobilization are proposed.








Abstract
Generating electricity in hydrogel is very important but remains difficult. Hydrogel with electricity generation capability is more capable in bio&#8208;relevant tasks such as tissue engineering, artificial skin, or medical treatment, because electricity is indispensable in regulating physiological activities. Here, a porous and phase blending hydrogel structure for effective piezoionic electricity generation is developed. Dynamic electric field is generated taking advantage of the difference in streaming speeds of sodium and chloride in the material. Microscopic porosity and hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic phase blending are the two key factors for prominent piezoionic performance. Voltages as high as 600&#160;mV are first realized in hydrogels in response to medical ultrasound stimulation. The hydrogel structure is also subjective to effective substance exchange and can actively enrich proteins from surroundings under mechanical stimuli. Preliminary applications in neural stimulation, constructing complex spatial&#8208;temporal chemical and electric field distribution patterns, mimetic tactile sensor, sample pretreatment in fast detection, and enzyme immobilization are demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Metallic Fenton&#8208;Active Center Construction for Extensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 and H2O and enhance &#183;OH yield using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 nanocrystals. The built&#8208;in electric field and electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies promote &#183;OH yield even in the tumor area with a low H2O2 concentration, resulting in extensive cellular damage and enhanced cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating the necroptosis pathway.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive cancer therapeutic strategy based on Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, the effectiveness of CDT is subject to the slow kinetic rate and non&#8208;homogeneous distribution of H2O2. In this study, a conceptual non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to enhance CDT efficiency using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 (BNBT&#8208;6) nanocrystals. The separated charge carriers under a piezoelectric&#8208;induced electric field synchronize the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O2, which consequently increases hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) yield even under low H2O2 levels. Moreover, acceptor doping induces electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies to facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 and H2O and further promote &#183;OH generation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that BNBT&#8208;6 induces extensive intracellular oxidative stress and enhances cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating necroptosis in addition to the conventional apoptotic pathway. This study proposes a novel design approach for nanomaterials used in CDT and presents a new treatment strategy for apoptosis&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>An Ultrafast Air Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast air self&#8208;charging Zn/polyaniline@Pt/C (Zn/PANI@Pt/C) battery is developed. Benefiting from the Pt/C catalysis, the reaction kinetics of the redox reaction between PANI and O2 is accelerated and the redox potential difference between them is extended due to the reduced overpotential of oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries exhibit superior self&#8208;charging performance compared with typical Zn/PANI batteries.








Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self&#8208;charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O2. Herein, an ultrafast air self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery is designed by constructing a polyaniline@Pt/C (PANI@Pt/C)&#160;composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O2 with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self&#8208;charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self&#8208;charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O2 simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self&#8208;charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, flexible soft&#8208;packaged Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries are fabricated and displayed stable electrochemical performance and self&#8208;rechargeability even at different bending states. A route is provided here to design ultrafast chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage devices and the horizons of flexible energy storage devices are broadened.

         <title>Synergizing a Large Ordinary Nernst Effect and Axis&#8208;Dependent Conduction Polarity in Flat Band KMgBi Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered flat band material, KMgBi, simultaneously exhibits axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity, which produces a large transverse thermoelectric effect (&#8776;46 &#181;V K&#8722;1), and ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) that greatly boosts this effect (&#8776;198 &#181;V K&#8722;1) with a 1.4 T magnetic field. The presence of both effects in one material enables an experimental understanding on their synergistic combination for transverse thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level. The valence band is highly anisotropic with minimal cross&#8208;plane dispersion, which, in combination with an isotropic conduction band, enables axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity. Thermopower and Hall measurements indicate dominant p&#8208;type conduction along the cross&#8208;plane direction, and n&#8208;type conduction along the in&#8208;plane direction, leading to a significant zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric response when the heat flux is at an angle to the principal crystallographic directions. Additionally, a large Ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) is observed with an applied field.&#160; It arises from the ambipolar term in the Nernst effect, whereby the Lorentz force on electrons and holes makes them drift in opposite directions so that the resulting Nernst voltage becomes a function of the difference between their partial thermopowers, greatly enhancing the ONE. It is proven that axis&#8208;dependent polarity&#160;can synergistically enhance the ONE, in addition to leading to a zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Mechanical Actuation via Homeomorphic Transformations of Topological Solitons within Polymer Coatings</title>

         <dc:description>
The response of a topological soliton embedded in a liquid crystal network. Upon thermal stimulus, complex reversible modulations are observed. For example, a field of valleys turn into protrusions with a modulation of 40%. The results are in agreement with the numerical model. This technology is expected to broaden the range of applications from tunable optical devices to tribology applications.








Abstract
Topological solitons are currently under investigation for their exotic properties, especially in nonlinear physics, optics, and material sciences. However, challenges of robust generation and limited stability over time have hindered their practical uses. To address this issue, an approach is developed to form structured arrays of solitons in films of polymerizable liquid crystals. Their complex molecular architecture is preserved by in situ photopolymerization forming a stable liquid crystal network. Most excitingly, their properties are advanced to include responsiveness functions. When thermally actuated, these topological solitons mediate the reconfiguration of surface topographies. Complex shape changes occur depending on the intrinsic complex spatial distribution of the director, which may even lead to full shape inversion and topographical changes as high as &#8776;40% of the initial thickness. Conversely, the shape changes provide information on the initial director profile, which is consistent with the mathematical model. The soliton&#8208;containing polymer coatings are applicable in multiple domains, ranging from tunable optics to haptics, and from shape&#8208;coupled sensing systems to temperature&#8208;coupled heat management.

         <title>A Cardiac&#8208;Targeted Nanozyme Interrupts the Inflammation&#8208;Free Radical Cycle in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle after myocardial infarction (MI) leads to heart failure and patient death. This work creates a Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme for cardiac&#8208;targeted myocardial infarction therapy, with powerful anti&#8208;inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. In mice and beagle dog MI models, it can improve cardiac function and reduce scarring, showing potential for clinical use in heart disease.








Abstract
Severe systemic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of patient mortality. MI&#8208;induced inflammation can trigger the production of free radicals, which in turn ultimately leads to increased inflammation in cardiac lesions (i.e., inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle), resulting in heart failure and patient death. However, currently available anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy due to their weak anti&#8208;inflammatory effect and poor accumulation at the cardiac site. Herein, a novel Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme is developed for targeted therapy of MI, which is generated by coordinating Fe3+ and anti&#8208;inflammatory drug curcumin (Cur) with further modification of tannic acid (TA). Such Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme exhibits excellent free radicals scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties by reducing immune cell infiltration, promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2&#8208;like phenotype, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and blocking the inflammatory free radicals cycle. Furthermore, due to the high affinity of TA for cardiac tissue, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA shows an almost tenfold greater in cardiac retention and uptake than Fe&#8208;Cur. In mouse and preclinical beagle dog MI models, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme preserves cardiac function and reduces scar size, suggesting promising potential for clinical translation in cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Scalable Solution&#8208;Processed Hybrid Electron Transport Layers for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an electron transport layer ink is designed using hybrid fullerenes composed of mixed C60, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct. This electron transport layer exhibits high conductivity, good energy&#8208;level alignment, and low interfacial nonradiative recombination. The all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2).








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade&#8208;coating on both wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.80 eV) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules is developed. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C60), phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial nonradiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal&#8208;evaporated C60. With scalable solution&#8208;processed HF as the ETLs, the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2). This study paves the way to all&#8208;solution processing of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules in the future.

         <title>Optical Nonlinearity Enabled Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing is of great significance in biology, medicine, and microscopic imaging. Here, a new approach is introduced using the optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. By applying a vortex beam, imaging resolution is enhanced and UCNPs are differentiated based on their distinctive nonlinearities. This enables a complementary dimension to spectral, temporal, and polarized dimensions for nanoscale multiplexing.








Abstract
Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point&#8208;spread function (PSF), creating a robust super&#8208;resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities.

&lt;p&gt;Multiplexing is of great significance in biology, medicine, and microscopic imaging. Here, a new approach is introduced using the optical nonlinearity of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for super-resolved multiplexing microscopy. By applying a vortex beam, imaging resolution is enhanced and UCNPs are differentiated based on their distinctive nonlinearities. This enables a complementary dimension to spectral, temporal, and polarized dimensions for nanoscale multiplexing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti-counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super-resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point-spread function (PSF), creating a robust super-resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. Four channels multiplexing super-resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150&#160;nm (1/6.5&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension &#8211; optical nonlinearity &#8211; to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high-density data storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Band Structure Engineering and Orbital Orientation Control Constructing Dual Active Sites for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction trend among redox reactions affect evolutionarily electrocatalytic activity. Using WS2 as an example, band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to construct Li&#8722;S and S&#8722;B dual&#8208;coordination, accurately modulating the interaction trend to accelerate the rate&#8208;determined process. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination design for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, helping with effective catalyst design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The kinetics difference among multistep electrochemical processes leads to the accumulation of soluble polysulfides and thus shuttle effect in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. While the interaction between catalysts and representative species has been reported, the root of the kinetics difference, interaction change among redox reactions, remains unclear, which significantly impedes the catalysts design for Li&#8722;S batteries. Here, this work deciphers the interaction change among electrocatalytic sulfur reactions, using tungsten disulfide (WS2) a model system to demonstrate the efficiency of modifying electrocatalytic selectivity via dual&#8208;coordination design. Band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to guide the design of WS2 with boron dopants and sulfur vacancies (B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x), accurately modulating interaction with lithium and sulfur sites in polysulfide species for relatively higher interaction with short&#8208;chain polysulfides. The modified interaction trend is experimentally confirmed by distinguishing the kinetics of each electrochemical reaction step, indicating the effectiveness of the designed strategy. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x delivers a gravimetric energy density of up to 417.6 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1 and negative/positive ratio of 1.2. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination strategy for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, offering a rational strategy to develop effective catalysts for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

The heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film transistors enables the fabrication of active&#8208;matrix perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) display. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. The fabricated active&#8208;matrix display exhibits excellent brightness control capability and a high switching speed, indicating the potential of PeLED as a promising light source.








Abstract
The uniform deposition of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and their integration with backplane thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) remain challenging for large&#8208;area display applications. Herein, an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display fabricated via the heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8208;based TFTs is presented. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of highly uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. PeLEDs are integrated with MoS2 TFTs to fabricate an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display with an 8 &#215; 8 array, which exhibits excellent brightness control capability and high switching speed. This study demonstrates the potential of PeLEDs as candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and presents a novel approach for fabricating optoelectronic devices via the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and perovskites, thereby paving the way toward the fabrication of practical future optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Breadmaking&#8208;Inspired Antioxidant Porous Yeast Microcarriers for Stem Cell Delivery in Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents an innovative application of breadmaking principle in the creation of porous microcarriers for adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) delivery (ADSC@YMC) to treat diabetic wound. Simultaneously, the release of glutathione (GSH) from the yeast imparts antioxidative qualities to the microcarriers, ultimately extending the viability and retention of ADSCs.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;based therapies have exhibited significant promise in the treatment of diabetic ulcers (DU). Nevertheless, enhancing the survival rate and functionality of transplanted stem cells poses a substantial challenge. In this study, inspired by the breadmaking process, yeast microcarriers (YMC) are devised as vehicles for stem cells to address these challenges. The fabrication of YMC involves the amalgamation of microfluidic emulsification with yeast&#8208;mediated fermentation, yielding microcarriers with outstanding biocompatibility, high porosity, and antioxidant activity. Adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded onto YMC display remarkable cell viability and retain their cellular functions effectively. Additionally, YMC boast a rich glutathione content and exhibit remarkable ROS scavenging ability, thus shielding the ADSCs from oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further substantiate that ADSC@YMC implementation significantly lowered ROS levels in diabetic wounds, resulting in enhanced stem cell retention and improved angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration. These results highlight the potential of ADSC@YMC as a promising platform for delivering stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Massively Scalable Self&#8208;Assembly of Nano and Microparticle Monolayers via Aerosol Assisted Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled colloidal lithography provides a cost effective and simple strategy to produce submicron and nanoscale lithography. However, current self&#8208;assembly strategies have proved very challenging to scale and maintain highly ordered nanostructured arrays. A novel aerosol&#8208;based strategy is demonstrated to increase colloidal self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 and new physical mechanisms governing the self&#8208;assembly are discussed.








Abstract
An extremely rapid process for self&#8208;assembling well&#8208;ordered, nano, and microparticle monolayers via a novel aerosolized method is presented. The novel technique can reach monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 from a single aerosolizing source and methods to reach faster monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates are outlined. A new physical mechanism describing the self&#8208;assembly process is presented and new insights enabling high&#8208;efficiency nanoparticle monolayer self&#8208;assembly are developed. In addition, well&#8208;ordered monolayer arrays from particles of various sizes, surface functionality, and materials are fabricated. This new technique enables a 93&#215; increase in monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates compared to the current state of the art and has the potential to provide an extremely low&#8208;cost option for submicron nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nano&#8208;CT Contrast Agent Leveraging Size Aggregation for Improved In Vivo Tumor CT Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monocomponent and size&#8208;adjustable nano&#8208;computed tomography (CT) contrast agent is developed by utilizing a reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive platform and a fluorogen with aggregation function for improved in vivo tumor CT imaging. The nano&#8208;CT contrast agent displays tumor&#8208;targeting property and can rapidly aggregate in tumor regions after activation, enhancing its retention efficiency and extending the imaging time window.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) is a widely utilized noninvasive diagnostic tool in clinical practice. However, the commonly employed small molecular iodinated contrast agents (ICAs) in clinical CT imaging have limitations such as nonspecific distribution in body, rapid clearance through kidneys, etc., leading to a narrow imaging time window. In contrast, existing nano&#8208;sized ICAs face challenges like structural uncertainty, poor reproducibility, low iodine content, and uniformity issues. In this study, a novel approach is presented utilizing the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) to design and fabricate a kind of monocomponent nano&#8208;sized ICA (namely, BioDHU&#8208;CT NPs) that exhibits a unique aggregation effect upon activation. The small sized BioDHU&#8208;CT nanoparticles exhibit excellent tumor targeting capabilities and can release ICA modified with AIEgen with a high release efficiency up to 88.45%, under the activation of reactive oxygen species highly expressed in tumor regions. The released ICA performs in situ aggregation capability in the tumor region, which can enhance the retention efficiency of CT contrast agents, extending the imaging time window and improving the imaging quality in tumor regions.

         <title>Rational Medium&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Strategy Toward Highly Efficient Violet&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Narrowed Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the wide&#8208;bandgap emitter fusing two ultraviolet multiple resonance fragments via a unique double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is presented. The resulting molecule can simultaneously achieve efficient violet&#8208;blue emission and narrowed spectra. The fabricated violet&#8208;blue electroluminescent device exhibits ideal performances with a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.5%.








Abstract
The spectral narrowing engineering of pure&#8208;organic emitters attracts great research interests in realizing high color purity. Here, the adjusted medium&#8208;range charge transfer (MCT) strategy of TIC&#8208;BO with rigid planar structure by fusing two typical UV&#8208;emitting multiple resonance (MR) fragments via the ingenious double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is reported. The resulting TIC&#8208;BO with MCT nature shows efficient violet&#8208;blue emission in dilute toluene and evaporated host&#8211;guest films, and desirably narrowed spectra are achieved by the suppression of structural relaxation and the shortened charge transfer states. The single&#8208;doped device with TIC&#8208;BO as emitter shows narrowed violet&#8208;blue electroluminescence peaked at 428&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 43&#160;nm (0.28&#160;eV), and the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.160, 0.050). A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.50% is achieved, which is among the best results of the corresponding violet&#8208;blue emitting region. Further introduction of a stronger electron&#8208;donating carbazole group makes TIC&#8208;BNO exhibit red&#8208;shifted sky&#8208;blue emission with MR&#8208;dominant properties, and good device performance is received with EQEmax of 34.58%. The outstanding performances of TIC&#8208;BO successfully demonstrate the significance and prospect of the proposed molecular design strategy.

         <title>Correlating Single&#8208;Atomic Ruthenium Interdistance with Long&#8208;Range Interaction Boosts Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with different and precise single&#8208;atomic interdistances are constructed via a combination of planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement, for systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the atomic level, precisely manipulating the electrostatic force using the atomic structure and leading to severalfold enhancement in the activity of c&#8208;SACs with multimetal sites.








Abstract
Correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with tailored intersite metal&#8211;metal interactions are superior to conventional catalysts with isolated metal sites. However, precise quantification of the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in c&#8208;SACs is not yet achieved, which is essential for a crucial understanding and remarkable improvement of the correlated metal&#8208;site&#8208;governed catalytic reaction kinetics. Here, three Ru c&#8208;SACs are fabricated with precise SAD using a planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement. This strategy results in graded SAD from 2.4 to 9.3 &#197; in the Ru c&#8208;SACs, wherein tailoring the Ru SAD into 7.0 &#197; generates an exceptionally high turnover frequency of 17.92 H2 s&#8722;1 and a remarkable mass activity of 100.4 A mg&#8722;1 under 50 and 100 mV overpotentials, respectively, which is superior to all the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm that Ru SAD has a negative correlation with its d&#8208;band center owing to the long&#8208;range interactions induced by distinct local atomic geometries, resulting in an appropriate electrostatic potential and the highest catalytic activity on c&#8208;SACs with 7.0 &#197; Ru SAD. The present study promises an attractive methodology for experimentally quantifying the metal SAD to provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of c&#8208;SACs.

         <title>Immunogenic PANoptosis&#8208;Initiated Cancer Sono&#8208;Immune Reediting Nanotherapy by Iteratively Boosting Cancer Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano/genetically engineered sonosensitive extracellular vesicles are rationally designed for ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic by efficiently inducing tumor immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively boosting cancer innate immunity cycle. This specific regulated cell death renders tumor cells highly immunogenic through maximally activating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby reprogramming negative immune microenvironment and advancing positive adaptive antitumor immune response.








Abstract
The cancer&#8208;immune cycle conceptualized the mechanisms of driving T cell responses to tumors, but w as limited by immunological ignorance elicited by tumor inherent immunoediting, which failed to initiate and maintain adaptive immunity. Targeting specific vulnerabilities of cell death patterns may provide unique opportunities to boost T cell antitumor immunological effects. Here an ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic strategy using nano/genetically engineered extracellular vesicles, which can induce tumor highly immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively start&#8208;up the energization of cancer innate immunity cycle by repeatedly liberating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby priming sufficient antigen&#8208;specific T cells and shaping protective immune response through activating cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathways, is reported. Aided by immune checkpoint blockade, the reprogramming of immune microenvironment further facilitated a prompt bridging of innate and adaptive immunity, and remarkably suppressed metastatic and rechallenged tumor growth. Thus, targeting PANoptotic cell death provides a catcher against immune escape and a positive&#8208;feedback immune activation gateway for overcoming immune resistance to intractable cancers.

Owing to the controllable intrafibrillar photocrosslinking, a composite fibrous hydrogel enables the variation in hydrogel stiffness without changing its architecture. For fibroblasts seeded on this gel, a sole increase in gel stiffness results in stronger contraction forces and activation.








Abstract
The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions. However, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. A composite fibrous hydrogel is developed to vary gel stiffness without affecting its structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel is formed from aldehyde&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl that provide the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, the hydrogel's elastic modulus is changed by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the same fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel is used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking results in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at a reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.

         <title>Boron and Nitrogen Isotope Effects on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride crystals with controlled concentrations of the boron (10B and 11B) and nitrogen (14N and 15N) isotopes are synthesized and their optical properties are measured, including their Raman spectra. This provides a method for tailoring hBN's optical and nuclear spin properties for specific applications.








Abstract
The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising 2D material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here, the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen are reported. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (&#8776;20 at% 10B, 80 at% 11B) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% 14N, 0.4 at% 15N), that is, almost pure 14N. In this study, the class of isotopically purified hBN crystals to 15N is extended. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N, are grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (&gt; 99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent. In&#8208;depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical properties of the 15N&#8208;purified crystals at the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of currently available 14N&#8208;purified hBN. The growth of high&#8208;quality h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat management, as well as for advanced functionalities in quantum technologies.

         <title>Architecture of Vanadium&#8208;Based MXene Dysregulating Tumor Redox Homeostasis for Amplified Nanozyme Catalytic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform is constructured for amplified nanozyme catalytic/ photothermal therapy, which displays favorable photothermal effect and nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed efficacy. Tumor hypoxia is relieved and lower thermal resistance contributes to photothermal therapy for further promoting enzycatalytic activity, which leads to a significant disruption of redox homeostasis and inhibition of tumor growth.








Abstract
Taking the significance of the special microenvironment for tumor cell survival into account, disrupting tumor redox homeostasis is highly prospective for improving therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional 2D vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform, V4C3/atovaquone@bovine albumin (V4C3/ATO@BSA, abbreviated as VAB) has been elaborately constructed for ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy. The redox homeostasis within the tumor cells is eventually disrupted, showing a remarkable anti&#8208;tumor effect. The VAB nanoplatform with mixed vanadium valence states can induce a cascade of catalyzed reactions in the tumor microenvironment, generating plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective glutathione consumption to amplify oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the stable and strong photothermal effect of VAB under near&#8208;infrared irradiation not only causes the necrosis of tumor cells, but also improves its peroxidase&#8208;like activity. In addition, the release of ATO can effectively alleviate endogenous oxygen consumption to limit triphosadenine formation and inhibit mitochondrial respiration. As a result, the expression of heat shock proteins is effectively suppressed to overcome thermoresistance and the production of ROS can be further promoted due to mitochondrial injury. Moreover, VAB also presents high photoacoustic and photothermal imaging performances. In brief, the multifunctional nanoplatform can provide ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy with broadening the biomedical applications of vanadium&#8208;based MXene.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible composite solid electrolyte based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 with excellent interface compatibility by a simple preparation method. Due to its excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal and cathodes, the lithium metal battery of Li||LFP at 0.5 C current density shows excellent cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3%).








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a crucial role in developing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high safety and energy density. Exploring SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance is the key to achieving the practical application of LMBs. In this work, the great potential of Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 (LNFP) as an ideal SSE due to its enhanced ionic conductivity and reliable stability in contact with lithium metal anode is demonstrated. Moreover, LNFP&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are prepared to further improve electronic insulation and interface stability. The CSE containing 50 wt% of LNFP (LNFP50) shows high ionic conductivity (3.58 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and good compatibility with Li metal anode and cathodes. Surprisingly, the LMB of Li|LNFP50|LiFePO4 cell at 0.5 C current density shows good cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3% Coulombic efficiency), and high&#8208;energy LMB of Li|LNFP50|Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 cell maintains 80% capacity retention after 170 cycles, which are better than that with traditional liquid electrolytes (LEs). This investigation offers a new approach to commercializing SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2310699, Bowen Jiang, Cheng Chen, Zongkui Kou, and co&#8208;workers report the precise manipulation of single&#8208;atomic Ru interdistances via a planar organometallic molecular design. Assembling the Ru interdistance to a rational level produces long&#8208;range interaction for electrocatalysis, whereas the unassembled ones are &#8220;on tiptoes&#8221; outside electrocatalysis.

Microneedle Patches
Due to the challenges associated with the extraction of dermal interstitial fluid (ISF), the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited. In article number 2304704, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers propose a fully integrated wearable device that leverages a versatile hollow microneedle patch for ISF extraction using touch&#8208;activated vacuum pressure. The developed device can continuously sample and detect ISF biomarkers for long periods.

Living Hydrogels
When embedded inside 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels, cells from the eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grow in clusters predominantly located in the hydrogel periphery, where they benefit from increased gas exchange and access to light. CO2 capture efficiency increases proportionally with the exposed surface area of the living hydrogels. These findings, presented by Kunal Masania, Marie&#8208;Eve Aubin&#8208;Tam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2305505 provide design parameters for the development of highly efficient 3D photosynthetic living materials.

Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy
The optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles can be transported by a vortex excitation beam onto the imaging point spread function for differentiating single nanoparticles. In article number 2308844, Chaohao Chen, Faliang Cheng, Lan Fu, Xiaoxue Xu, Fan Wang, and co&#8208;workers propose a novel and efficient dimension, optical nonlinearity, for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy and demonstrate its orthogonal capacity to emission color in a four&#8208;channel multiplexed imaging.

Electrochemical Microactuators
In article number 2304517, Mahdi Hamidinejad, Michael De Volder, and co&#8208;workers introduce a new type of ultralow&#8208;power electrochemical microactuator. These microsctructures are made out of lithographically defined 3D carbon nanotube architectures that are loaded with active materials that can alloy with lithium. Upon electrochemical lithiation and delithiation of that material, the microstructures are actuated reversibly.

         <title>Micro&#8208;/Nanohierarchical Structures Physically Engineered on Surfaces: Analysis and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent decades, significant progress has been achieved in micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of such structures, provides a classification of their basic constituents according to function and shape, and discusses the related fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
The high demand for micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures as components of functional substrates, bioinspired devices, energy&#8208;related electronics, and chemical/physical transducers has inspired their in&#8208;depth studies and active development of the related fabrication techniques. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces, which offer the advantages of wide&#8208;range material compatibility, design diversity, and mechanical stability, and numerous unique structures with important niche applications have been developed. This review categorizes the basic components of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces according to function/shape and comprehensively summarizes the related advances, focusing on the fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces are compared based on the function of their basic components, which may help to avoid the bottlenecks of conventional single&#8208;scale functional substrates. Thus, the present work is expected to provide a useful reference for scientists working on multicomponent functional substrates and inspire further research in this field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is an elegant bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties in a facile and eco&#8208;friendly manner. The current review article provides a bird's eye view of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting application and provides a comprehensive outlook.








Abstract
Fast production of hydrogen and oxygen in large amounts at an economic rate is the need of the hour to cater to the needs of the most awaited hydrogen energy, a futuristic renewable energy solution. Production of hydrogen through simple water splitting via visible light photocatalytic approach using sunlight is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches for generating clean fuels. For this purpose, a variety of catalytic techniques and novel catalysts have been investigated. Among these catalysts, carbon nitride is presently deemed as one of the best candidates for the visible light photocatalysis due to its unique molecular structure and adequate visible&#8208;range bandgap. Its bandgap can be further engineered by structural and morphological manipulation or by doping/hybridization. Among numerous synthetic approaches for carbon nitrides, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is one of the recently developed elegant bottom&#8208;up strategies as it is bio&#8208;inspired and provides a facile and eco&#8208;friendly route to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties. The current review article broadly covers supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting applications and provides a comprehensive outlook on future directions.

         <title>The Material World of 3D&#8208;Bioprinted and Microfluidic&#8208;Chip Models of Human Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials are essential components of disease models as they more precisely replicate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D&#8208;bioprinted and microfluidic&#8208;chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.








Abstract
Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound&#8208;healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting&#8208;edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively.

     alt="The Material World of 3D-Bioprinted and Microfluidic-Chip Models of Human Liver Fibrosis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomaterials are essential components of disease models as they more precisely replicate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D-bioprinted and microfluidic-chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound-healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting-edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of material hints and cell&#8211;material interactions in a tridimensional context is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights recent representative research progress using metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their composites with antibacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity for the treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. It is, therefore, reviewed the structural&#8211;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discusses how their multifunctionality and customizability can be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Ion Engineering Strategies toward High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes and names various types of multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies. The recent advances of aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries are presented, and the reaction mechanisms, application effects, merits, and disadvantages of different multi&#8208;ion strategies are comprehensively evaluated to provide guidance for the development of ideal aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
As alternatives to batteries with organic electrolytes, aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studied. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of the cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of the cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carrier is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, this is the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, and future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high performance.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal Particle Modified Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest development of nanoscale metal particle modified single&#8208;atom catalysts (NMP&#8208;SACs) from the aspects of synthesis, characterization techniques, and catalytic applications. The mechanism behind their superior performance in various catalytic applications is discussed. The review ends with relevant challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs in the future.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their well&#8208;defined active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency, and unique unsaturated coordinated structures. However, their effectiveness is limited to reactions requiring active sites containing multiple metal atoms. Furthermore, the loading amounts of single&#8208;atom sites must be restricted to prevent aggregation, which can adversely affect the catalytic performance despite the high activity of the individual atoms. The introduction of nanoscale metal particles (NMPs) into SACs (NMP&#8208;SACs) has proven to be an efficient approach for improving their catalytic performance. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to systematically introduce the synthesis, characterization, and application of NMP&#8208;SACs and the mechanisms behind their superior catalytic performance. This review first presents and classifies the different mechanisms through which NMPs enhance the performance of SACs. It then summarizes the currently reported synthetic strategies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of NMP&#8208;SACs. Moreover, their application in electro/thermo/photocatalysis, and the reasons for their superior performance are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs for the future design of advanced catalysts are addressed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress with regard to MXene&#8208;based current collectors for rechargeable batteries is systematically reviewed. The application of MXene in the current collector has achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. Up to now, various effective strategies have been presented and achieved positive effects, such as vacuum filtration, freeze&#8208;drying and in situ electrodeposition, etc.








Abstract
As an indispensable component of rechargeable batteries, the current collector plays a crucial role in supporting the electrode materials and collecting the accumulated electrical energy. However, some key issues, like uneven resources, high weight percentage, electrolytic&#160;corrosion, and high&#8208;voltage instability, cannot meet the growing need for rechargeable batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The recent progress with regard to MXene-based current collectors for rechargeable batteries is systematically reviewed. The application of MXene in the current collector has achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. Up to now, various effective strategies have been presented and achieved positive effects, such as vacuum filtration, freeze-drying and in situ electrodeposition, etc.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an indispensable component of rechargeable batteries, the current collector plays a crucial role in supporting the electrode materials and collecting the accumulated electrical energy. However, some key issues, like uneven resources, high weight percentage, electrolytic&#160;corrosion, and high-voltage instability, cannot meet the growing need for rechargeable batteries. In recent years, MXene-based current collectors have achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. The related research has increased significantly. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review of this area is seldom. Herein the applications and progress of MXene in current collector are systematically summarized and discussed. Meanwhile, some challenges and future directions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as An Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, we present a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, we demonstrate that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, we establish an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>

Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, we created a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC). The TNC consisted of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC released heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produced virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulated the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen-doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity-determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;assisted modification is introduced for the construction of SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating and sulfur atoms substituting lattice oxygen. The sulfur anions in the lattice enhance the reversibility of the anionic redox by modulating the band of the redox&#8208;active center. The additional coating effectively traps the escaping active oxygen, and the trapped oxygen and coating return to the pristine upon discharge.








Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0 &#8804; n &lt; 2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;Based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;Codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208;Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The improvement of the stability and environmental durability of organic electronics is a challenge for the promising applications in universal environments. Herein, a stable organic photosynaptic transistor based on a photoinitiator is developed with broad operation capabilities in vacuum, dried air, and high&#8208;humidity environment. This design provides a promising platform for long&#8208;term stable organic synaptic electronics.








Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lose the synaptic responses under vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen levels can be a challenge. Herein, a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules is reported. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, the photoinduced free radical is utilized to realize the photosynaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photosynaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device is successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacing of monolayer MoS2 with 2DCOF films determines a major enhancement in the charge transport through the 2D semiconductor. Electron doping intensity is amplified by the superlattice's long&#8208;range order, while the lattice vibration is suppressed by the high mechanical stiffness yielding a confinement effect. The MoS2 /2D&#8208;COF heterostructures represent a novel strategy to develop high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








Abstract
The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

         <title>Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core&#8208;Shell Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.








Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal cations and organic ligands forming ordered structures through coordination, with their unique composition eliminating the problem of local hot zones and uneven mixing encountered in laser micropropulsion (LMP), allowing for enhanced propulsion efficiency.








Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, dispersible conductive particles are simply afforded via acid crystallization of commercial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) in solution. The particles feature a tunable internal surfactant which enables intrinsic aqueous processibility for incorporation within hydrogels without complex additives or surfactants. The particles are loaded into a resin and printed via microstereolithography, offering hydrogels with biocompatibility, structural fidelity, and high conductivity (1&#8211;10 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#181;m)&#160;are&#160;printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform area&#8208;emissive white OLET device with an efficiency of 13.9% is realized by incorporating phosphorescent blue emissive and fluorescent yellow emissive guests in the active layer based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration, which is the highest value in the field and demonstrates great potential for full&#8208;color display as backlight source for the first time.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies but remains greatly challenging. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission, are demonstrated. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs and prevents exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10-fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small-area (0.09 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large-area cells (1.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2.56 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale-up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high-performance indoor PSCs (i-PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large-area printing technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Practical Approach Toward Highly Reproducible and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on an Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality and reproducibility of perovskite thin films are severely influenced by spin&#8208;coating parameters and annealing conditions. Here, a facile and cost&#8208;effective aging treatment is developed to improve film coverage and uniformity. The resulting devices achieve higher device performance reproducibility and impressive operational stability under both air and vacuum conditions.








Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated study of conventional superconducting materials is presented, wherein the transition temperatures of approximately 200 000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are close to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability to maximize the probability of synthesizability. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
A large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow is performed, starting by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8211;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8211;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, the transition temperatures (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions, are identified. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which is predicted to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has previously been synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature&#8208;adjusted absorption enables a self&#8208;adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co&#8208;N3 sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte toward Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of boron&#8208;rich CEI is proposed by selecting salts and solvents with reasonable HOMO levels, which can stabilize the NCM811 at both RT and high temperature by suppressing the degradation of particles and decreasing the consumption of electrolytes. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy to decrease the safety risk of NCM811||Li battery.








Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable electrolyte, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, these two issues are tackled via engineering the electrolytes, that is, utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI is generated, which effectively inhibited the side reactions, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, the electrolyte recipe can introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative toward practical applications. As such, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalized graphene nanopores exhibit distinct monovalent ions transport behaviors including transport&#8208;rectification and exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity through precise pore structure and surface functional groups regulation. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultra&#8208;low permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene but also attribute to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8776;48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <title>Halide Perovskites&#8208;Based Diffusive Memristors for Artificial Mechano&#8208;Nociceptive System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of threshold response in the MAPbI3:Ag&#8208;based artificial nociceptor neurons and threshold firing of output current. The mechano&#8208;nociceptive system, utilizing halide perovskites&#8208;based memristors with a force sensing resistor, demonstrates the capability to detect detrimental impacts through sensitization responses. Scaling up to a 5 &#215; 5 crossbar array, the artificial skin system achieves successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses.








Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8776;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses is achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. These results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self&#8208;assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost&#8208;effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee&#8208;stain&#8208;like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self&#8208;assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on&#8208;demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle&#8208;dependent color and polarization&#8208;selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet&#8208;printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge-transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness-tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III-nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p-type aluminum-gallium-nitride (p-AlGaN) nanowires grown on n-Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge-transfer behavior between the p-AlGaN/electrolyte and p-AlGaN/n-Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity-switching-point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated-photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

&lt;p&gt;Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn-based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn-based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two-step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn-metal anode.

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Both cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)-based immunotherapy are the first-line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

&lt;p&gt;S&#8596;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery that uses a cost-effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super-high utilization (100% vs &amp;lt; 1% for Zn).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low-potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in static aqueous S&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries by using Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near-to-theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;vs $3500 m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra-high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high-energy, low-cost, and fast-chargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all-solid-state and single-step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high-resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long-existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <title>Amphoteric Ion Bridged Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Regulating Phase Separation Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;Rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated I2 in the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite induces I&#8208;rich phase formation through a chemical chain reaction. The Br&#8722; binding strength in the perovskite regulates the chemical chain reaction and thus the I&#8208;rich phase formation. This study demonstrates the increasing of Br&#8208;binding strength and eliminating of defects leading to I2 photogeneration in the lattice to stabilize the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite.








Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, it is shown that how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can react with bromide (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (I&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-I&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Br&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form the I-rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and the Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves large&#8208;grained Sb2S3 films by incorporating Ce3+ into the precursor solution for hydrothermal deposition. The formation of ultrathin Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface is proposed to mediate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 grains. Planar Sb2S3 solar cells are achieved with an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;close to 800 mV (the highest reported to date), along with competitive efficiencies up to 7.66%.








Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally friendly semiconductor for high performance solar cells. But, like many other polycrystalline materials, Sb2S3 is limited by nonradiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries (GBs). This work shows how the GB density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#160;&#177;&#160;40&#160;to 327&#160;&#177;&#160;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, it is revealed that a critical factor is the formation of an ultrathin Ce2S3 layer at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which can reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as promote lateral grain growth. Through reductions in nonradiative recombination at GBs and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface, as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, this work achieves high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%. An impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV is achieved, which is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in a Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N&#160;=&#160;&#177;1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.








Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&#8722;3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%.

&lt;p&gt;Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity-stability balance at industrial-grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali-water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND-Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain-like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R-Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali-water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND-Ni catalyst featured by a three-dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND-Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record-low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8776;$0.95, which is less than the target of $2.0 per GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The results suggest the feasibility of ND-Ni substitute for R-Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8211;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
Chemically replaced interfacial layer design, via unveiling the influence of zinc (Zn) crystal facets for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries, is introduced by Dong&#8208;Wan Kim and co&#8208;workers in article number 2308684. Owing to the unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side&#8208;reactions of metallic Sn) merits of the chemically replaced layer, uniform dendrite&#8208;free Zn(002)&#8208;preferred Zn deposition is guided and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions are suppressed. A superior performance even under practical operating conditions is thereby achieved.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2305128, Qing Sun, Shang Wang, Yanhong Tian, Andreu Cabot, and co&#8208;workers report an investigation of the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of a layered Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). They demonstrate that the zinc ion is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed; in contrast, proton charge&#8208;storage dominates the process. They also demonstrate the great application prospects of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.

Zinc Anodes
In article number 2307219, Huanlei Wang, Jingyi Wu, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report Co single atoms as an electrolyte additive to facilitate dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes. The additive can be preferentially adsorbed on the zinc surface in which the atomically dispersed zincophilic active site with strong charge polarization effect regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interphase, thus promoting uniform zinc deposition.

Graphene Nanopores
In article number 2307242, Liping Guo, Luda Wang, and co&#8208;workers report functionalized graphene nanopores that exhibit distinct monovalent&#8208;ion transport behaviors including exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
In article number 2306653, Wenshuai Chen, Gang Chen, Feng Jiang, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchically structured cellulose nanofiber/lithium chloride scaffold through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying methods for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The milli&#8208;/micrometer multiscale pores provide more exposed active area with the surrounding air, thus accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed structure.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <title>Bistable Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles for Molecular Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover materials showing bistability are very attractive for fabricating molecular electronic devices. Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphatically concentrates on the detailed summary of strategic design and comprehensive overview of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregated scaffolds for perfecting and extending the NIR&#8208;II imaging window. By overviewing the nowadays research advances, this review paves the way for constructing bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregated emitters to promote bioimaging applications.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>

         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.
