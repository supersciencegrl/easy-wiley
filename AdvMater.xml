         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes towards Ultra&#8208;high Brightness and Stability</title>

Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives have been widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, we point the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides, and explore the underlying mechanism. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). We then demonstrate a surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1&#160;h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. Our findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Excess ammonium halides as composition additives have been widely employed in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in-depth understanding whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, we point the trade-off between the performance and stability in high-efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides, and explore the underlying mechanism. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt-induced ion-doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field-dependent ion-drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). We then demonstrate a surface clean assisted cross-linking strategy to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (The highest value for FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1&#160;h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), concurrently.

         <title>Topological Defect&#8208;regulated Porous Carbon Anodes with fast Interfacial and Bulk Kinetics for High&#8208;rate and High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are regarded as one of the most promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), but their rate capabilities have been largely limited by the slow solid&#8208;state potassium diffusion kinetics inside anode and sluggish interfacial potassium ion transfer process. Herein, high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity PIBs have been demonstrated by facile topological defect&#8208;regulation of the microstructure of carbon anodes. The carbon lattice of the as&#8208;obtained porous carbon nanosheets with abundant topological defects (TDPCNSs) holds high potassium adsorption energy yet low potassium migration barrier, thereby enabling efficient storage and diffusion of potassium inside graphitic layers. Moreover, the topological defects can induce preferential decomposition of anions, leading to the formation of high potassium ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with decreased potassium ion de&#8208;solvation and transfer barrier. Additionally, the dominant sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon conjugated skeleton of TDPCNSs enables high electrical conductivity (39.4 S cm&#8722;1) and relatively low potassium storage potential. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed TDPCNSs anode demonstrates high potassium storage capacity (504&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (118&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1) as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;highly stiff and tough shape memory polyurea with unprecedentedenergy density by precise slight cross&#8208;linking</title>

Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, we report an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross&#8208;linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea (CSSMP), which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), facilitated by the formation of strain&#8208;induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high&#8208;performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Induced Ultra&#8208;Long Stability of Conductive &#928;&#8208;d Conjugated FeCo3(DDA)2 with High OER Activity</title>

Abstract
Conductive &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide concerns in electrocatalysis due to their intrinsic high conductivity. However, the poor electrocatalytic stability is still a major problem that hinders the practical application of MOFs. Herein, we report a novel approach to enhancing the stability of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalyst, namely, the introduction of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Impressively, the &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOF FeCo3(DDA)2 exhibits ultra&#8208;high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability (up to 2000&#160;h). The experimental studies demonstrate that the presence of H&#8208;bonds in FeCo3(DDA)2 is responsible for its ultra&#8208;high OER stability. Besides that, FeCo3(DDA)2 also displays a prominent OER activity (an overpotential of 260&#160;mV versus RHE at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 46.86&#160;mV dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate that the synergistic effect of the Fe and Co sites in FeCo3(DDA)2 contributes to its prominent OER performance. This work provides a new avenue of boosting the electrocatalytic stability of conductive &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOFs.

Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, we proposed a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite was controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures was also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <title>Decoding Excimer Formation in Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks Induced by Morphology and Ring Torsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of extended organic semiconductors routinely used for photocatalysis. However, excited&#8208;state charge dynamics in these materials is still a black box. This work establishes the effect of physical parameters, e.g., morphology and topography of COFs on their photophysical&#160;and&#160;photocatalytic properties originating from different transient intermediates.








Abstract
A thorough and quantitative understanding of the fate of excitons in covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) after photoexcitation is essential for their augmented optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications via precise structure tuning. The synthesis of a library of COFs having identical chemical backbone with impeded conjugation, but varied morphology and surface topography to study the effect of these physical properties on the photophysics of the materials is herein reported. The variation of crystallite size and surface topography substantified different aggregation pattern in the COFs, which leads to disparities in their photoexcitation and relaxation properties. Depending on aggregation, an inverse correlation between bulk luminescence decay time and exciton binding energy of the materials is perceived. Further transient absorption spectroscopic analysis confirms the presence of highly localized, immobile, Frenkel excitons (of diameter 0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;nm) via an absence of annihilation at high density, most likely induced by structural torsion of the COF skeletons, which in turn preferentially relaxes via long&#8208;lived (nanosecond to microsecond) excimer formation (in femtosecond scale) over direct emission. These insights underpin the importance of structural and topological design of COFs for their targeted use in photocatalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes the importance of advanced materials in enhancing electromagnetic stimulation for neural repair. It delves into biochemical and biophysical mechanisms, exploring how materials contribute to increasing the efficacy and safety of electromagnetic stimulation. It also summarizes a range of advancements in applications and concludes with an analysis of the potential and future directions of electromagnetic neural stimulation.








Abstract
Bioelectricity plays a crucial role in organisms, being closely connected to neural activity and physiological processes. Disruptions in the nervous system can lead to chaotic ionic currents at the injured site, causing disturbances in the local cellular microenvironment, impairing biological pathways, and resulting in a loss of neural functions. Electromagnetic stimulation has the ability to generate internal currents, which can be utilized to counter tissue damage and aid in the restoration of movement in paralyzed limbs. By incorporating implanted materials, electromagnetic stimulation can be targeted more accurately, thereby significantly improving the effectiveness and safety of such interventions. Currently, there have been significant advancements in the development of numerous promising electromagnetic stimulation strategies with diverse materials. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the fundamental theories, neural stimulation modulating materials, material application strategies, and pre&#8208;clinical therapeutic effects associated with electromagnetic stimulation for neural repair. It offers a thorough analysis of current techniques that employ materials to enhance electromagnetic stimulation, as well as potential therapeutic strategies for future applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt; 25% Efficiency: Unveiling the Hidden Bottom Surface of Perovskite Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the often&#8208;overlooked PbI2 residual and its detailed impact on device performance are thoroughly investigated. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a PCE of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
While significant efforts in surface engineering have been devoted to the conversion process of lead iodide (PbI2) into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI2 clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, a new strategy involving 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives is developed and it is found that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI2 clusters as well as filling vacancies. The introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI2 film, facilitating better penetration of the second&#8208;step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI2 and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI2 clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI2. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Main&#8208;Group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for Selective 2&#8208;Electron and 4&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed with varied oxidation states of the Sb sites via changing the contents of sulfur dopants, resulting in tunable ORR selectivity toward either the 4&#8208;electron or 2&#8208;electron pathway.








Abstract
The selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for various energy conversion processes such as the fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries for the 4e&#8722; pathway and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis for the 2e&#8722; pathway. However, it remains a challenge to tune the ORR selectivity of a catalyst in a controllable manner. Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160; is reported. Significantly, Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e&#8722; pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g&#8722;1 at 0.65&#160;V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e&#8722; pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89&#160;V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C. In addition, practical applications for these two 2e&#8722;/4e&#8722; ORR catalysts are demonstrated by bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis for the degradation of organic pollutants and a high&#8208;power zinc&#8208;air battery, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the excellent selectivity for the sulfurized Sb&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is attributed to the optimal adsorption&#8208;desorption of the ORR intermediates realized through the electronic structure modulation by the sulfur dopants.

         <title>Achieving Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes at Low Temperature via Regulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of THF successfully regulates electrolyte solvation structure, promotes the uniform deposition of Zn2+, reduces side reactions, and inhibits the formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits a highly cyclic stability for more than 4000&#160;h (over 5&#160;months) at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal capacity of 1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Zinc metal is an attractive anode material for rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, and freezing problem of aqueous electrolyte at low temperatures are the major roadblocks that hinder the widely commercialization of ZIBs. Herein, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is proposed as the electrolyte additive to improve the reversibility and stability of Zn anode. Theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the introduction of THF into the aqueous electrolyte can optimize the solvation structure which can effectively alleviate the H2O&#8208;induced side reactions and protect the Zn anode from corrosion. Moreover, THF can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to interact with H2O, which can greatly reduce the activity of free H2O in electrolytes and improve the low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance of Zn anode. As a result, the Zn anodes demonstrate high cyclic stability for 2800&#160;h at 27&#160;&#176;C and over 4000&#160;h at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 /1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability and rate capability at 27 and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C.

     alt="Achieving Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes at Low Temperature via Regulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of THF successfully regulates electrolyte solvation structure, promotes the uniform deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, reduces side reactions, and inhibits the formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits a highly cyclic stability for more than 4000&#160;h (over 5&#160;months) at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an areal capacity of 1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc metal is an attractive anode material for rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the dendrite growth, water-induced parasitic reactions, and freezing problem of aqueous electrolyte at low temperatures are the major roadblocks that hinder the widely commercialization of ZIBs. Herein, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is proposed as the electrolyte additive to improve the reversibility and stability of Zn anode. Theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the introduction of THF into the aqueous electrolyte can optimize the solvation structure which can effectively alleviate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-induced side reactions and protect the Zn anode from corrosion. Moreover, THF can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to interact with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which can greatly reduce the activity of free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in electrolytes and improve the low-temperature electrochemical performance of Zn anode. As a result, the Zn anodes demonstrate high cyclic stability for 2800&#160;h at 27&#160;&#176;C and over 4000&#160;h at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C at 1.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; /1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The full cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability and rate capability at 27 and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C. This work is expected to provide a new approach to regulate the aqueous electrolyte and Zn anode interface chemistry for highly stable and reversible Zn anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Ultrathin 2D Transistors for Monolithic 3D Integration: A Study on Directly Grown Nanocrystalline Interconnects and Buried Contacts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin, high&#8208;performance transistor layer suitable for multilayer stacking is developed for monolithic 3D integration, utilizing directly grown nanocrystalline graphene and dry&#8208;transferred MoS2 film. This device structure retains the advantages of a dangling bond&#8208;free, ultrathin channel and low contact resistivity, making it a significant enabler for high&#8208;density 3D circuit technology.








Abstract
The potential of monolithic 3D integration technology is largely dependent on the enhancement of interconnect characteristics which can lead to thinner stacks, better heat dissipation, and reduced signal delays. Carbon materials such as graphene, characterized by sp2 hybridized carbons, are promising candidates for future interconnects due to their exceptional electrical, thermal conductivity and resistance to electromigration. However, a significant challenge lies in achieving low contact resistance between extremely thin semiconductor channels and graphitic materials. To address this issue, an innovative wafer&#8208;scale synthesis approach is proposed that enables low contact resistance between dry&#8208;transferred 2D semiconductors and the as&#8208;grown nanocrystalline graphitic interconnects. A hybrid graphitic interconnect with metal doping reduces the sheet resistance by 84% compared to an equivalent thickness metal film. Furthermore, the introduction of a buried graphitic contact results in a contact resistance that is 17 times lower than that of bulk metal contacts (&gt;40&#160;nm). Transistors with this optimal structure are used to successfully demonstrate a simple logic function. The thickness of active layer is maintained within sub&#8208;7&#160;nm range, encompassing both channels and contacts. The ultrathin transistor and interconnect stack developed here, characterized by a readily etchable interlayer and low parasitic resistance, leads to heterogeneous integration of future 3D integrated circuits (ICs).

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids Combined with 3D Hybridization Chain Reaction Amplifiers for Monitoring Multiple Human Tear Cytokines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors leverage DNA tetrahedral frameworks modified on the wireless portable electrodes to effectively capture 3D hybridization chain reaction amplifiers for automatic and sensitive monitoring of multiple dry eye syndrome&#8208;associated cytokines in human tears with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg mL&#8722;1, consuming as little as 3 mL of tear fluid. 









Abstract
Existing tear sensors are difficult to perform multiplexed assays due to the minute amounts of biomolecules in tears and the tiny volume of tears. Herein, the authors leverage DNA tetrahedral frameworks (DTFs) modified on the wireless portable electrodes to effectively capture 3D hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplifiers for automatic and sensitive monitoring of multiple cytokines in human tears. The developed sensors allow the sensitive determination of various dry eye syndrome (DES)&#8208;associated cytokines in human tears with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg&#160;mL&#8722;1, consuming as little as 3 mL of tear fluid. Double&#8208;blind testing of clinical DES samples using the developed sensor and commercial ELISA shows no significant difference between them. Compared with single&#8208;biomarker diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of this sensor based on multiple biomarkers has improved by &#8776;16%. The developed system offers the potential for tear sensors to enable personalized and accurate diagnosis of various ocular diseases.

The sustainable device cycle by utilizing water to reconstitute flexible electronic devices using perovskite and conductor materials is developed. Large&#8208;scale metal&#8208;free flexible X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated by one&#8208;click restart show an average&#160;sensitivity as high as 6204 &#181;C Gyair&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2, making them very effective for X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, finding a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable method for handling end&#8208;of&#8208;life devices has remained challenging. Here, a &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; eco&#8208;friendly recycling strategy is introduced for end&#8208;of&#8208;life perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This method, utilizing water, allows for the recapture and reuse of both perovskite and conductor materials. The process is straightforward and environmentally friendly, eliminating the need for further chemical treatment, purification, additional additives or catalysts, and complex equipment. A sustainable device cycle is developed by reconstructing flexible perovskite membranes for wearable electronics from recycled materials. Large&#8208;scale, flexible membranes made from metal&#8208;free perovskite DABCO&#8208;N2H5&#8208;I3 (DABCO = N&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) achieve remarkably impressive average sensitivity of 6204 &#177; 268 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 102.3 nGyair s&#8722;1, which makes highly effective for X&#8208;ray imaging. The sensitivity of recycled flexible devices not only matches that of single&#8208;crystal devices made with fresh materials but also ranks as the highest among all metal&#8208;free perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; applies to scalable flexible devices derived from aged single&#8208;crystal counterparts, offering significant cost, time, and energy savings compared to their single&#8208;crystal equivalents. Such advantages significantly boost future market competitiveness.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Engineering of Cubic SiP with Metallic Conductivity for Fast and Durable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy silicon&#8208;phosphides are synthesized, demonstrating significantly improved charge and mass transport rates, and superior anti&#8208;pulverization capability, compared with the parent phases.








Abstract
A cost&#8208;effective, scalable ball milling process is employed to synthesize the InGeSiP3 compound with a cubic ZnS structure, aiming to address the sluggish reaction kinetics of Si&#8208;based anodes for Lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Experimental measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirm that the synthesized InGeSiP3 exhibits significantly higher electronic conductivity, larger Li&#8208;ion diffusivity, and greater tolerance to volume change than its parent phases InGe (or Si)P2 or In (or Ge, or Si)P. These improvements stem from its elevated configurational entropy. Multiple characterizations validate that InGeSiP3 undergoes a reversible Li&#8208;storage mechanism that involves intercalation, followed by conversion and alloy reactions, resulting in a reversible capacity of 1733&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 90%. Moreover, the InGeSiP3&#8208;based electrodes exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining an 1121&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 capacity with a retention rate of &#8776;87% after 1500 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and remarkable high&#8208;rate capability, achieving 882&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of high entropy, the synthesis is extended to high entropy GaCu (or Zn)InGeSiP5, CuZnInGeSiP5, GaCuZnInGeSiP6, InGeSiP2S (or Se), and InGeSiPSSe. This endeavor overcomes the immiscibility of different metals and non&#8208;metals, paving the way for the electrochemical energy storage application of high&#8208;entropy silicon&#8208;phosphides.

Moreover, the InGeSiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrodes exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining an 1121&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; capacity with a retention rate of &#8776;87% after 1500 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable high-rate capability, achieving 882&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of high entropy, the synthesis is extended to high entropy GaCu (or Zn)InGeSiP&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, CuZnInGeSiP&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, GaCuZnInGeSiP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, InGeSiP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (or Se), and InGeSiPSSe. This endeavor overcomes the immiscibility of different metals and non-metals, paving the way for the electrochemical energy storage application of high-entropy silicon-phosphides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Reactive Sputtering of Transparent Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Monolithic and Stacked Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, interface reactive sputtering of transparent electrode is reported for fabricating high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and tandem solar cells (TSCs). Finally, high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 19.17%, 26.89%, and 24.33% are achieved for a semitransparent PSC, a four&#8208;terminal TSC, and a two&#8208;terminal TSC, respectively.








Abstract
Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) fulfills the requirements of top transparent electrodes (TTEs) in semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and stacked tandem solar cells (TSCs), as well as of the recombination layers in monolithic TSCs. However, the high&#8208;energy ITO particles will cause damage to the devices. Herein, the interface reactive sputtering strategy is proposed to construct cost&#8208;effective TTEs with high transmittance and excellent carrier transporting ability. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is chosen as the interface reactant that can react with sputtered ITO nanoparticles,&#160;so that, coordination compounds can be formed during the deposition process, facilitating the carrier transport at the interface of C60/PEI/ITO. Besides, the impact force of energetic ITO particles is greatly alleviated, and the intactness of the underlying C60 layer and perovskite layer is guaranteed. Thus, the prepared semitransparent subcells achieve a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.17%, surpassing those based on C60/ITO (11.64%). Moreover, the PEI&#8208;based devices demonstrate excellent storage stability, which maintains 98% of their original PCEs after 2000 h. On the strength of the interface reactive sputtering ITO electrode, a stacked all&#8208;perovskite TSC with a PCE of 26.89% and a monolithic perovskite&#8211;organic TSC with a PCE of 24.33% are successfully fabricated.

         <title>Monodispersed and Organic Amine Modified La(OH)3 Nanocrystals for Superior Advanced Phosphate Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodispersed and organic amine modified lanthanum hydroxide (OA&#8208;La(OH)3) nanocrystals are synthesized via a nonaqueous wet&#8208;chemical method. The OA&#8208;La(OH)3 nanocrystals further expose La adsorption sites and minimize mass transfer barrier by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), thereby dramatically increasing its phosphate adsorption capacity, pH adaptability, and anti&#8208;interference performance.








Abstract
Advanced phosphate removal is critical for alleviating the serious and widespread aquatic eutrophication, strongly depending on the development of superior adsorption materials to overcome low chemical affinity and sluggish mass transfer at low phosphate concentrations. Herein, the first synthesis of monodispersed and organic amine modified&#160;lanthanum hydroxide nanocrystals (OA&#8208;La(OH)3) for advanced phosphate removal by modulating inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), is reported. These OA&#8208;La(OH)3 nanocrystals with positively charged surfaces and abundant exposed La sites exhibit&#160;specific affinity toward phosphate, delivering a maximum adsorption capacity of 168&#160;mg P&#160;g&#8315;1 and a wide pH adaptability from 3.0 to 11.0, as well as a robust anti&#8208;interference performance, far surpassing those of documented phosphate removal materials. The superior phosphate removal performance of OA&#8208;La(OH)3 is attributed to its protonated organic amine in IHP, which enhances the electrostatic attraction around the adsorbent&#8208;solution interface. Impressively, OA&#8208;La(OH)3 can treat &#8776;5 000 and &#8776;3 200 bed volumes of simulated and real phosphate&#8208;containing wastewater to below extremely strict standard (0.1&#160;mg&#160;L&#8315;1) in a fixed&#8208;bed adsorption mode, exhibiting great potential for advanced phosphate removal. This study offers a facile modification strategy to improve phosphate removal performance of nanoscale adsorbents, and sheds light on the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship of La&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Rotating Cathode with Periodical Changes in Electrolyte Layer Thickness for High&#8208;Rate Li&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is generally believed that the rate performance of Li&#8210;O2 batteries (LOBs) is limited by the slow mass transfer. To this end, a new type of LOB with a rotating cathode has been designed to decouple the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2, and consequently, the rate performance of LOBs has been significantly improved.








Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) possess the highest theoretical gravimetric energy density among all types of secondary batteries, but they are still far from practical applications. The poor rate performance resulting from the slow mass transfer is one of the primary obstacles in LOBs. To solve this issue, a rotating cathode with periodic changes in the electrolyte layer thickness is designed, decoupling the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2. During rotation, the thinner electrolyte layer on the cathode facilitates the O2 transfer, and the thicker electrolyte layer enhances the Li+ transfer. As a result, the rotating cathode enables the LOBs to undergo 58 cycles at 2.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and discharge stably even at a high current density of 7.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, it also makes the batteries exhibit a large discharge capacity of 6.8 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the capacity decay is much slower with increasing current density. Notably, this rotating electrode holds great promise for utilization in other electrochemical cells involving gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces, suggesting a viable approach to enhance the mass transfer in such systems.

         <title>Boltzmann Switching MoS2 Metal&#8208;semiconductor Field&#8208;effect Transistors Enabled by Monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped Metal Gates at the Schottky&#8208;Mott Limit</title>

Abstract
A gate stack that facilitates a high&#8208;quality interface and tight electrostatic control is crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, when constructing conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structures with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide channels, achieving these requirements becomes challenging due to inherent difficulties in obtaining high&#8208;quality gate dielectrics through native oxidation or film deposition. Here, we report a gate&#8208;dielectric&#8208;less device architecture of van der Waals Schottky gated metal&#8208;semiconductor FETs (vdW&#8208;SG MESFETs) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel and surface&#8208;oxidized metal gates such as nickel and copper. Benefiting from the strong SG coupling, our MESFETs operate at remarkably low gate voltages, &lt;0.5&#160;V. Notably, they also exhibit Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching behavior featured by a subthreshold swing of &#8764;60&#160;mV/dec and negligible hysteresis. These ideal FET characteristics are attributed to the formation of a Fermi&#8208;level (EF) pinning&#8208;free gate stack at the Schottky&#8208;Mott limit. Furthermore, we experimentally and theoretically confirm that EF depinning can be achieved by suppressing both metal&#8208;induced and disorder&#8208;induced gap states at the interface between the monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate and the MoS2 channel. This work paves a new route for designing high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient 2D electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A gate stack that facilitates a high-quality interface and tight electrostatic control is crucial for realizing high-performance and low-power field-effect transistors (FETs). However, when constructing conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor structures with two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide channels, achieving these requirements becomes challenging due to inherent difficulties in obtaining high-quality gate dielectrics through native oxidation or film deposition. Here, we report a gate-dielectric-less device architecture of &lt;i&gt;van der Waals&lt;/i&gt; Schottky gated metal-semiconductor FETs (&lt;i&gt;vdW&lt;/i&gt;-SG MESFETs) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) channel and surface-oxidized metal gates such as nickel and copper. Benefiting from the strong SG coupling, our MESFETs operate at remarkably low gate voltages, &amp;lt;0.5&#160;V. Notably, they also exhibit Boltzmann-limited switching behavior featured by a subthreshold swing of &#8764;60&#160;mV/dec and negligible hysteresis. These ideal FET characteristics are attributed to the formation of a Fermi-level (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) pinning-free gate stack at the Schottky-Mott limit. Furthermore, we experimentally and theoretically confirm that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; depinning can be achieved by suppressing both metal-induced and disorder-induced gap states at the interface between the monolithic-oxide-gapped metal gate and the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel. This work paves a new route for designing high-performance and energy-efficient 2D electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled polymerization allows scalable access to light&#8208;driven artificial muscles based on molecular motors. A combined experimental and computer simulation framework provides deep insights into how chain conformational aspects and density of active motors influence contraction kinetics and load&#8208;lifting capacity.








Abstract
The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, it is shown that light&#8208;driven molecular motors with sensitive photo&#8208;isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu&#8208;mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star&#8208;shaped motor&#8208;polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over the molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high&#8208;end group fidelity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi&#8208;ideal network topology, exhibiting light&#8208;triggered contraction. The influence of arm length and polymer structure is investigated, and the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes is developed. Leveraging this scalable methodology, the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo&#8208;lifting artificial muscles is showcased, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach. It is anticipated that the integrated experimental and simulation framework will accelerate scalable approaches for active polymer materials based on molecular machines, opening up new horizons in materials science and bioscience.

         <title>Mechanical and Functional Responses in Astrocytes under Alternating Deformation Modes Using Magneto&#8208;Active Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Astrocytes respond to mechanical actuation changing their structure, mechanical properties, and functional activity. A magneto&#8208;mechanical system simulates traumatic brain injury and stroke&#8208;induced substrate deformations in vitro. These time&#8208;evolving deformations lead to intertwined remodeling of actin cytoskeleton modulating the mechanical properties of the cell and activating Piezo1. These coordinated changes may influence the protective role of astrocytes for neighboring neurons.








Abstract
This work introduces NeoMag, a system designed to enhance cell mechanics assays in substrate deformation studies. NeoMag uses multidomain magneto&#8208;active materials to mechanically actuate the substrate, transmitting reversible mechanical cues to cells. The system boasts full flexibility in alternating loading substrate deformation modes, seamlessly adapting to both upright and inverted microscopes. The multidomain substrates facilitate mechanobiology assays on 2D and 3D cultures. The integration of the system with nanoindenters allows for precise evaluation of cellular mechanical properties under varying substrate deformation modes. The system is used to study the impact of substrate deformation on astrocytes, simulating mechanical conditions akin to traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke. The results reveal local heterogeneous changes in astrocyte stiffness, influenced by the orientation of subcellular regions relative to substrate strain. These stiffness variations, exceeding 50% in stiffening and softening, and local deformations significantly alter calcium dynamics. Furthermore, sustained deformations induce actin network reorganization and activate Piezo1 channels, leading to an initial increase followed by a long&#8208;term inhibition of calcium events. Conversely, fast and dynamic deformations transiently activate Piezo1 channels and disrupt the actin network, causing long&#8208;term cell softening. These findings unveil mechanical and functional alterations in astrocytes during substrate deformation, illustrating the multiple opportunities this technology&#160;offers.

         <title>Deeply Lithiated Carbonaceous Materials for Great Lithium Metal Protection in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;rich disordered rock salt shell is revealed as a multifunctional decorator to tailor carbonaceous materials with great ability to protect Li metal electrode in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Protection of lithium (Li) metal electrode is a core challenge for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Carbon materials with variant structures have shown great effect of Li protection in liquid electrolytes, however, can accelerate the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) decomposition owing to the high electronic conductivity, seriously limiting their application in ASSLMBs. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to tailor the carbon materials for efficient Li protection in ASSLMBs, by in situ forming a rational niobium&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich disordered rock salt (DRS) shell on the carbon materials, providing a favorable percolating Li+ diffusion network for speeding the carbon lithiation, and enabling simultaneously improved lithiophilicity and reduced electronic conductivity of the carbon structure at deep lithiation state. Using the proposed strategy, different carbon materials, such as graphitic carbon paper and carbon nanotubes, are tailored with great ability to speed the interfacial kinetics, homogenize the Li plating/stripping processes, and suppress the SE decompositions, enabling much improved performances of ASSLMBs under various conditions approaching the practical application. This strategy is expected to create a novel roadmap of Li protection for developing reliable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLMBs.

         <title>Reconciling the Cooperative&#8211;Competitive Patterns among Tumor and Immune Cells for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Treatment Using Multimodule Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodule nanocomplex dual targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is devised to reconcile cooperative&#8211;competitive patterns among multiple cells through metabolic&#8208;immune regulation. The reversion of metabolic disequilibrium&#8208;immunosuppression tumor microenvironment is observed in TNBC models after treatment, contributing to the tumor remission.








Abstract
Targeting the competitive&#8211;cooperative relationships among tumor cells and various immune cells can efficiently reverse the immune&#8208;dysfunction microenvironment to boost the immunotherapies for the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer treatment. Hence, a bacterial outer membrane vesicle&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed for specifically targeting malignant cells and immune cells to reconcile the relationships based on metabolic&#8208;immune crosstalk. By uniquely utilizing the property of charge&#8208;reversal polymers to realize function separation, the nanocomplexes could synergistically regulate tumor cells and immune cells. This approach could reshape the immunosuppressive competition&#8211;cooperation pattern into one that is immune&#8208;responsive, showcasing significant potential for inducing tumor remission in TNBC models.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with a size of 3.5&#160;nm, composed of FeCoNiCuMn are successfully synthesized, and they are immobilized on TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimal 0.5&#8208;HEA/TiO2 sample demonstrates a remarkable 23&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to pristine TiO2, with excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation and high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation.








Abstract
Metal nanoparticle (NP) cocatalysts are widely investigated for their ability to enhance the performance of photocatalytic materials; however, their practical application is often limited by the inherent instability under light irradiation. This challenge has catalyzed interest in exploring high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), which, with their increased entropy and lower Gibbs free energy, provide superior stability. In this study, 3.5&#160;nm&#8208;sized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NPs composed of a FeCoNiCuMn HEA are successfully synthesized. With theoretic calculation and experiments, the electronic structure of HEA in augmenting the catalytic CO2 reduction has been uncovered, including the individual roles of each element and the collective synergistic effects. Then, their photocatalytic CO2 reduction capabilities are investigated when immobilized on TiO2. HEA NPs significantly enhance the CO2 photoreduction, achieving a 23&#8208;fold increase over pristine TiO2, with CO and CH4 production rates of 235.2 and 19.9&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Meanwhile, HEA NPs show excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation, as well high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;Noble-metal-free high-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with a size of 3.5&#160;nm, composed of FeCoNiCuMn are successfully synthesized, and they are immobilized on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The optimal 0.5-HEA/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sample demonstrates a remarkable 23-fold increase in activity compared to pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation and high-energy X-ray irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal nanoparticle (NP) cocatalysts are widely investigated for their ability to enhance the performance of photocatalytic materials; however, their practical application is often limited by the inherent instability under light irradiation. This challenge has catalyzed interest in exploring high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which, with their increased entropy and lower Gibbs free energy, provide superior stability. In this study, 3.5&#160;nm-sized noble-metal-free NPs composed of a FeCoNiCuMn HEA are successfully synthesized. With theoretic calculation and experiments, the electronic structure of HEA in augmenting the catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction has been uncovered, including the individual roles of each element and the collective synergistic effects. Then, their photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction capabilities are investigated when immobilized on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. HEA NPs significantly enhance the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, achieving a 23-fold increase over pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of 235.2 and 19.9&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Meanwhile, HEA NPs show excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation, as well high-energy X-ray irradiation. This research emphasizes the promising role of HEA NPs, composed of earth-abundant elements, in revolutionizing the field of photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Modules for Efficient and Reliable Low&#8208;Grade Heat Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoelectric module with a balanced conversion efficiency of 6.9% and output power density of 0.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2 (&#916;T = 200 K) is obtained based on the zone&#8208;melted Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 with CuGaTe2 addition. CuGaTe2 not only strengthens the interlayer interaction, but also introduces various defects. Finally, a peak ZT of 1.25 and an average ZT of 1.02 (300&#8211;500 K) are&#160;achieved.








Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloy has long been considered as the most promising candidate for low&#8208;grade waste heat power generation. However, optimizing the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 is more challenging than that of p&#8208;type counterparts due to its greater sensitivity to texture, and thus limits the advancement of thermoelectric modules. Herein, the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 is enhanced by incorporating a small amount of CuGaTe2, resulting in a peak ZT of 1.25 and a distinguished average ZT of 1.02 (300&#8211;500 K). The decomposed Cu+ strengthens interlayer interaction, while Ga+ optimizes carrier concentration within an appropriate range. Simultaneously, the emerged numerous defects, such as small&#8208;angle grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and dislocations, significantly suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity. Based on the size optimization by finite element modelling, the constructed thermoelectric module yields a high conversion efficiency of 6.9% and output power density of 0.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under a temperature gradient of 200 K. Even more crucially, the efficiency and output power little loss after subjecting the module to 40 thermal cycles lasting for 6 days. This study demonstrates the efficient and reliable Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric modules for broad applications in low&#8208;grade heat harvest.

         <title>Self&#8208;Lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A living hydrogel with embedded biofactories of hyaluronic acid allows the development of contact lens prototypes with permanent self&#8208;lubrication and full transparency. Lubricant release is adjusted by the mechanical and diffusional properties of the hydrogel and regulated by the availability of nutrients in simulated tear fluid.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens (CL) wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of CLs is presented. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the CL material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least 3 weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the CL surface. A self&#8208;lubricating CL prototype is presented, where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial CLs. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of CLs for vision correction. It is envisioned that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living CL could enable long&#8208;term wear comfort for CL users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

Design of multilayer capacitor according to design rules for optimizing the breakdown field and energy storage capacity in the BZT/BST multilayer system, which presents an extremely large recoverable energy&#8208;storage density of 165.6&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and high energy efficiency of 93% (left). Volume and surface&#8208;area recoverable energy&#8208;storage densities for some representative dielectric capacitors in bulk, thick&#8208;film, and thin&#8208;film structures (right).








Abstract
Future pulsed&#8208;power electronic systems based on dielectric capacitors require the use of environment&#8208;friendly materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance that can operate efficiently and reliably in harsh environments. Here, a study of multilayer structures, combining paraelectric&#8208;like Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) with relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric BaZr0.4Ti0.6O3 (BZT) layers on SrTiO3&#8208;buffered Si substrates, with the goal to optimize the high energy&#8208;storage performance is presented. The energy&#8208;storage properties of various stackings are investigated and an extremely large maximum recoverable energy storage density of &#8776;165.6&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (energy efficiency&#160;&#8776;&#160;93%) is achieved for unipolar charging&#8211;discharging of a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT/20&#8208;nm&#8208;BST/910&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT/20&#8208;nm&#8208;BST/25&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT multilayer structure, due to the extremely large breakdown field of 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1 and the lack of polarization saturation at high fields in this device. Strong indications are found that the breakdown field of the devices is determined by the outer layers of the multilayer stack and can be increased by improving the quality of these layers. Authors are also able to deduce design optimization rules for this material combination, which can be to a large extend justify by structural analysis. These rules are expected also to be useful for optimizing other multilayer systems and are therefore very relevant for further increasing the energy storage density of capacitors.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8208;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Mineralizing Bone Organoids with Bone Matrix&#8208;Inspired Hydroxyapatite Hybrid Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Addressing large bone defects remains a significant challenge owing to the inherent limitations in self&#8208;healing capabilities, resulting in prolonged recovery and suboptimal regeneration. Although current clinical solutions are available, they have notable shortcomings, necessitating more efficacious approaches to bone regeneration. Organoids derived from stem cells show great potential in this field; however, the development of bone organoids has been hindered by specific demands, including the need for robust mechanical support provided by scaffolds and hybrid extracellular matrices (ECM). In this context, bioprinting technologies have emerged as powerful means of replicating the complex architecture of bone tissue. Our research focused on the fabrication of a highly intricate bone ECM analog using a novel bioink composed of GelMA/AlgMA/hydroxyapatite. Bioprinted scaffolds facilitate the long&#8208;term cultivation and progressive maturation of extensive bioprinted bone organoids, foster multicellular differentiation, and offer valuable insights into the initial stages of bone formation. The intrinsic self&#8208;mineralizing quality of our bioink closely emulates the properties of natural bone, empowering organoids with enhanced bone repair for both in vitro and in vivo applications. This trailblazing investigation propels the field of bone tissue engineering and holds significant promise for its translation into practical applications.

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, we create artificial muscles that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate and damage&#8208;tolerance, verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, our knotted artificial muscles could empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law (F = C &#8211; P + 2). When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, we expand the sharp phase boundary to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8208;amorphous&#8208;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in&#8208;situ synchrotron diffraction, we elucidate that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>Annual Energy&#8208;Saving Smart Windows with Actively Controllable Passive Radiative Cooling and Multimode Heating Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Smart windows with radiative heat management capability using the sun and outer space as zero&#8208;energy thermodynamic resources have gained prominence, demonstrating a minimum carbon footprint. However, realizing on&#8208;demand thermal management throughout all seasons while reducing fossil energy consumption remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an energy&#8208;efficient smart window that enables actively tunable passive radiative cooling (PRC) and multimode heating regulation is demonstrated by integrating the emission&#8208;enhanced polymer&#8208;dispersed liquid crystal (SiO2@PRC PDLC) film and a low&#8208;emission layer deposited with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, this device can achieve a temperature close to the chamber interior ambient under solar irradiance of 700&#160;W m&#8722;2, as well as a temperature drop of 2.3&#160;&#176;C at sunlight of 500&#160;W m&#8722;2, whose multistage PRC efficiency can be rapidly adjusted by a moderate voltage. Meanwhile, synchronous cooperation of passive radiative heating, solar heating, and electric heating endows this smart window with the capability to handle complicated heating situations during cold weather. Energy simulation reveals the substantial superiority of this device in energy savings compared with single&#8208;layer SiO2@PRC PDLC, normal glass, and commercial low&#8208;E glass when applied in different climate zones. This work provides a feasible pathway for year&#8208;round thermal management, presenting a huge potential in energy&#8208;saving applications.

         <title>Ultrathin High&#8208;Entropy Fe&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide Nanosheets with Metalloid Band Structures for Efficient Nitrate Reduction towards Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spinel oxides with tunable chemical compositions have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts, however their performance is greatly limited by small surface area and low electron conductivity. Here, we rationally design ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides nanosheets (i.e., (Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2)Fe2O4; denotes A5Fe2O4) in thickness of &#8764;4.3&#160;nm with large surface area and highly exposed active sites via a modified sol&#8208;gel method. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the bandgap of A5Fe2O4 nanosheets is significantly smaller than that of ordinary Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides, realizing the transformation of binary spinel oxide from semiconductors to metalloids. As a result, such A5Fe2O4 nanosheets manifest excellent performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), with a NH3 yield rate of &#8764;2.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE), outperforming other spinel&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that the NO3&#8722;RR is mainly occurred on Fe sites, and introducing high&#8208;entropy compositions in tetrahedral sites regulates the adsorption strength of N and O&#8208;related intermediates on Fe for boosting the NO3&#8722;RR. The above findings offer a high&#8208;entropy platform to regulate the bandgap and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides.

Abstract
An understanding of the structural properties that allow for optimal cathode performance, and their origin, is necessary for devising advanced cathode design strategies and accelerating the commercialisation of next&#8208;generation cathodes. High&#8208;voltage, Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathodes offer a low&#8208;cost and cobalt&#8208;free, yet energy&#8208;dense alternative to commercial cathodes. In this work, we explore the effect of substituents on several important structure properties including Ni/Mn ordering, charge distribution and extrinsic defects. In the cation&#8208;disordered samples studied, we observe a correlation between increased Fe/Mg substitution, Li&#8208;site defects and Li&#8208;rich impurity phase formation &#8211; the concentrations of which are greater for Mg&#8208;substituted samples. We attribute this to the lower formation energy of MgLi defects when compared to FeLi defects. Li&#8208;site defect&#8208;induced impurity phases consequently alter the charge distribution of the system, resulting in increased [Mn3+] with Fe/Mg substitution. In addition to impurity phases, other charge compensators were also investigated to explain the origin of Mn3+ (extrinsic defects, [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies and intrinsic off&#8208;stoichiometry), although their effects were found to be negligible.

         <title>Universal Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Direct Thermal Decomposition of Molten Salts for Boosting Acidic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide&#8208;ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, we report a universal strategy to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non&#8208;noble metal oxides through a facile one&#8208;step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non&#8208;noble metal nitrate and a small&#8208;amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non&#8208;noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation&#8208;exchange in the in&#8208;situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as&#8208;synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

         <title>Design of Excellent Mechanical Performances and Magnetic Refrigeration via In Situ Forming Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology can achieve higher energy efficiency based on the magnetocaloric effect. However, the practical application of MCE materials is hindered by their poor mechanical properties, making them challenging to process into devices. Conventional strengthening strategies usually lead to a trade&#8208;off with refrigeration capacity reduction. Here, a novel design is presented to overcome this dilemma by forming dual&#8208;phase alloys through in&#8208;situ precipitation of a tough magnetic refrigeration phase within an intermetallic compound with excellent MCE. In the alloy 87.5Gd&#8208;12.5Co, incorporating the interconnected tough phase Gd contributes to enhanced strength (&#8776; 505&#160;MPa) with good ductility (&#8776; 9.2%). The strengthening phase Gd simultaneously exhibits excellent MCE, enabling the alloy to achieve a peak refrigeration capacity of 720 J&#8729;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the alloy shows low thermal expansion induced by the synergistic effect of the two phases. It is beneficial for maintaining structural stability during heat exchange in magnetic refrigeration. The coupling interaction between the two magnetic phases can broaden the refrigeration temperature range and reduce hysteresis. This study guides the development of new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and magnetic refrigeration properties as needed for gas liquefaction and refrigerators.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, we report a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula &#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212; changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula were evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula &#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212; normalized blood glucose levels for three days and controlled postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version &#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212; likewise demonstrated tight, three&#8208;day regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

         <title>Minimally Invasive Delivery of Percutaneous Ablation Agent via Magnetic Colloidal Hydrogel Injection for Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic colloidal hydrogel, constructed from a binary system of biocompatible Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles, exhibits excellent injectability and remarkable magnetically induced heating performance. Functioning as an ablation agent, the hydrogel presents the potential to integrate magnetic&#8208;medium&#8208;mediated hyperthermia therapy with minimally invasive implantation procedures, thereby introducing a novel strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Percutaneous thermotherapy, a minimally invasive operational procedure, is employed in the ablation of deep tumor lesions by means of target&#8208;delivering heat. Conventional thermal ablation methods, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, to a certain extent, are subjected to extended ablation time as well as biosafety risks of unwanted overheating. Given its effectiveness and safety, percutaneous thermotherapy gains a fresh perspective, thanks to magnetic hyperthermia. In this respect, an injectable&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;construct&#8208;based thermal ablation agent is likely to be a candidate for the aforementioned clinical translation. Adopting a simple and environment&#8208;friendly strategy, a magnetic colloidal hydrogel injection is introduced by a binary system comprising super&#8208;paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles. The colloidal hydrogel constructs, unlike conventional bulk hydrogel, can be easily extruded through a percutaneous needle and then self&#8208;heal in a reversible manner owing to the unique electrostatic cross&#8208;linking. The introduction of magnetic building blocks is exhibited with a rapid magnetothermal response to an alternating magnetic field. Such hydrogel injection is capable of generating heat without limitation of deep penetration. The materials achieve outstanding therapeutic results in mouse and rabbit models. These findings constitute a new class of locoregional interventional thermal therapies with minimal collateral damages.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes and Minor Concentration Quenching: Achieving High&#8208;Performance Nondoped and Doped Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type molecular skeleton is designed to realize blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence with ultrahigh emission efficiencies (up to 99%), nanosecond exciton lifetimes, and effectively suppressed concentration quenching in films. The doped and nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes attain high external quantum efficiencies up to 32.0% and 26.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), ultrashort exciton lifetime, and suppressed concentration quenching in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials is desirable yet challenging. Here, a novel acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type TADF emitter, namely, 2BO&#8208;sQA, wherein two oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron (BO) acceptors are arranged with cofacial alignment and positioned nearly orthogonal to the rigid dispirofluorene&#8208;quinolinoacridine (sQA) donor is reported. This molecular design enables the compound to achieve highly efficient (PLQYs up to 99%) and short&#8208;lived (nanosecond&#8208;scale) blue TADF with effectively suppressed concentration quenching in films. Consequently, the doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) base on 2BO&#8208;sQA achieve exceptional electroluminescence performance across a broad range of doping concentrations, maintaining maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) at over 30% for doping concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 wt%. Remarkably, the nondoped blue OLED achieves a record&#8208;high maximum EQE of 26.6% with a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.0% at 1000 candelas per square meter. By using 2BO&#8208;sQA as the sensitizer for the multiresonance TADF emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue emission. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this molecular design in developing TADF emitters with high efficiency, ultrashort exciton lifetime, and minimal concentration quenching.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Binary Alloy with Oxide Nanosheath for Highly Efficient and Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RuFe oxide catalyst loaded on carbon felt is synthesized through a rapid Joule heating method for oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media. The catalyst has high activity and stable working time up to 250 h in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer devices, which provides a new idea for the research of anode catalyst for industrial water electrolysis.








Abstract
Traditional noble metal oxide, such as RuO2, is considered a benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its practical application is limited due to sluggish activity and severe electrochemical corrosion. In this study, Ru&#8208;Fe nanoparticles loading on carbon felt (RuFe@CF) is synthesized via an ultrafast Joule heating method as an active and durable OER catalyst in acidic conditions. Remarkably low overpotentials of 188 and 269&#160;mV are achieved at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, with a robust stability up to 620 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When used as an anode in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst shows more than 250 h of stability at a water&#8208;splitting current of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental characterizations reveal the presence of a Ru&#8208;based oxide nanosheath on the surface of the catalyst during OER tests, suggesting a surface reconstruction process that enhances the intrinsic activity and inhibits continuous metal dissolution. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of Fe into the RuFe@CF catalyst reduces the energy barrier and boosts its activities. This work offers an effective and universal strategy for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts for acidic water splitting.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombic 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) Cu&#8208;TBA (TBA&#160;=&#160;octahydroxyltetrabenzoanthracene) is employed as the cathode material for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu&#8208;TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu&#8208;HHTP (HHTP&#160;=&#160;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxyltriphenylene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention as promising electroactive materials for energy storage. However, their further applications are hindered by low capacity, limited cycling life, and underutilization of the active sites. Herein, Cu&#8208;TBA (TBA&#160;=&#160;octahydroxyltetrabenzoanthracene) with large conjugation units (narrow energy gap) and a unique rhombus topology is introduced as the cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Notably, Cu&#8208;TBA with a rhombus topology exhibits a high specific surface area (613&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and metallic band structure. Additionally, Cu&#8208;TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu&#8208;HHTP (HHTP&#160;=&#160;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxyltriphenylene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work elucidates a new strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs cathode materials by narrowing the energy gap of organic linkers, effectively expanding the utilization of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for SIBs.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Rectified Gradient Porous Polymeric Film for Solar&#8208;Thermal Regulatory Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible and thermally rectified gradient porous polymeric film is synthesized using a concentration&#8208;gradient polymerization approach. This gradient porous polymeric film possesses both thermal rectification and spectral&#8208;selective properties, making it a promising candidate as a solar&#8208;thermal regulatory cooling material that is capable of mitigating parasitic heat and solar radiation from outdoors while on&#8208;demand dissipating excess heat from indoors.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal regulation concerning thermal insulation and solar modulation is pivotal for cooling textiles and smart buildings.&#160;Nevertheless, a contradiction arises in balancing the demand to prevent external heat infiltration with the efficient dissipation of excess heat from enclosed spaces. Here, a concentration&#8208;gradient polymerization strategy is presented for fabricating a gradient porous polymeric film comprising interconnected polymeric microspheres. This method involves establishing an electric field&#8208;driven gradient distribution of charged crosslinkers in the precursor solution, followed by subsequent polymerization and freeze&#8208;drying processes. The resulting porous film exhibits a significant porosity gradient along its thickness, leading to exceptional unidirectional thermal insulation capabilities with a thermal rectification factor of 21%. The gradient porous film, with its thermal rectification properties, effectively reconciles the conflicting demands of diverse thermal conductivity for cooling unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces. Consequently, the gradient porous film demonstrates remarkable enhancements in solar&#8208;thermal management, achieving temperature reductions of 3.0 and 4.1&#160;&#176;C for unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces, respectively, compared to uniform porous films. The developed gradient&#8208;structured porous film thus holds promise for the development of thermal&#8208;rectified materials tailored to regulate solar&#8208;thermal conditions within enclosed environments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique review logic focusing on the working mechanisms governing perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO&#8208;TSCs) is explored as the fundamental solution. The optimization of perovskite absorber, organic absorber, and interconnection layer as pivotal strategies for maximizing the device performance is in&#8208;depth analyzed.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO&#8208;TSCs) demonstrate exceptional suitability for emerging applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, wearable devices, and greenhouse farming. By leveraging the distinctive attributes of perovskite and organic materials, which encompass expanded solar spectrum utilization, chemically benign solubility, and soft nature, PO&#8208;TSCs position themselves as ideal candidates for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent photovoltaics (ST&#8208;PVs). Despite these advantages, their development significantly lags behind other perovskite&#8208;based counterparts, such as perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, and perovskite/Cu(In, Ga)Se2. To address existing challenges and unlock the full potential of PO&#8208;TSCs, an exploration of the fundamental mechanisms governing tandem photovoltaic devices is embarked. Delving into critical aspects such as charge generation/separation, energy level alignment, and material choices becomes pivotal for optimizing PO&#8208;TSC performance. The investigation of monolithic two&#8208;terminal PO&#8208;TSCs offers insights into achievements and barriers, recognizing the competitive landscape with other TSC counterparts. Further scrutiny of perovskite absorbers and organic absorbers in TSCs reveals strategies aimed at enhancing stability and efficiency. The discussion extends to interconnection layers, elucidating their role in optimizing light transmission and balancing carrier recombination. In conclusion, a compelling outlook on the dynamic landscape of PO&#8208;TSCs is presented, highlighting the remarkable efficiency progression and signaling their potential to revolutionize solar energy harvesting technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO-TSCs) demonstrate exceptional suitability for emerging applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, wearable devices, and greenhouse farming. By leveraging the distinctive attributes of perovskite and organic materials, which encompass expanded solar spectrum utilization, chemically benign solubility, and soft nature, PO-TSCs position themselves as ideal candidates for high-performance semi-transparent photovoltaics (ST-PVs). Despite these advantages, their development significantly lags behind other perovskite-based counterparts, such as perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, and perovskite/Cu(In, Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To address existing challenges and unlock the full potential of PO-TSCs, an exploration of the fundamental mechanisms governing tandem photovoltaic devices is embarked. Delving into critical aspects such as charge generation/separation, energy level alignment, and material choices becomes pivotal for optimizing PO-TSC performance. The investigation of monolithic two-terminal PO-TSCs offers insights into achievements and barriers, recognizing the competitive landscape with other TSC counterparts. Further scrutiny of perovskite absorbers and organic absorbers in TSCs reveals strategies aimed at enhancing stability and efficiency. The discussion extends to interconnection layers, elucidating their role in optimizing light transmission and balancing carrier recombination. In conclusion, a compelling outlook on the dynamic landscape of PO-TSCs is presented, highlighting the remarkable efficiency progression and signaling their potential to revolutionize solar energy harvesting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Logistics Automation in Nanofactory: Cobalt Phosphide Embedded Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic nanofactory is constructed by embedding CoP nanocrystals within Zn&#8208;ZIF for ammonia production via nitride reduction reaction. Mimicking the modern factory with manufacturing machines and logistics automation, the designed CoP/Zn&#8208;ZIFs nanofactory reinforces the overall nitride reduction process from feedstock supply, reactant conversion, and product desorption, achieving excellent Faraday efficiency and production rate of ammonia.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a promising strategy for green ammonia synthesis and wastewater treatment, the rational design of electrocatalysts is the cornerstone. Inspired by modern factory design where both machines and logistics matter for manufacturing, it is reported that cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in zinc&#8208;based zeolite imidazole frameworks (Zn&#8208;ZIF) function as a nanofactory with high performance. By selective phosphorization of ZnCo bimetallic zeolite imidazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;ZIF), the generated CoP nanoparticles act as &#8220;machines&#8221; (active sites) for molecular manufacturing (NO3&#8722; to NH4+ conversion). The purposely retained framework (Zn&#8208;ZIFs) with positive charge promotes logistics automation, i.e., the automatic delivery of NO3&#8722; reactants and timely discharge of NH4+ products in&#8208;and&#8208;out the nanofactory due to electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the interaction between Zn&#8208;ZIF and CoP modulates the Co sites into electron insufficient state with upshifted d&#8208;band center, facilitating the reduction/hydrogenation of NO3&#8722; to ammonia and restricting the competitive hydrogen evolution. Consequently, the assembled CoP/Zn&#8208;ZIF nanofactory exhibits superior NitRR performances with a high Faraday efficiency of &#8776;97% and a high ammonia yield of 0.89&#160;mmol cm&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in neutral condition, among the best of reported electrocatalysts. The work provides new insights into the design principles of efficient NitRR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Machine Learning to Promote Efficient Screening of Low&#8208;Contact Electrode for 2D Semiconductor Transistor Under Limited Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and feature&#8208;adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low&#8208;contact electrodes for 2D semiconductor transistors in a limited data scenario is proposed. This scheme outperforms classical models and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art boosting techniques trained using limited datasets, as well as models trained using randomly selected data.








Abstract
Low&#8208;barrier and high&#8208;injection electrodes are crucial for high&#8208;performance (HP) 2D semiconductor devices. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies for electrode material screening are impractical because of their low efficiency and arbitrary specificity. Although machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative to tackle this problem, its practical application in semiconductor devices is hindered by its substantial data requirements. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and a feature&#8208;adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low&#8208;contact electrode materials for 2D semiconductor transistors with limited data is proposed. The proposed scheme exhibits exceptional performance by training with only 15% of the total data points, where the mean square errors are 0.17 and 0.27&#160;eV for the vertical and lateral Schottky barrier, respectively, and 2.88% for tunneling probability. Further, it exhibits an optimal predictive performance for 100 randomly sampled training datasets, reveals the underlying physical insight based on the identified features, and realizes continual improvement by employing detailed density&#8208;of&#8208;states descriptors. Finally, the empirical evaluations of the transport characteristics are conducted and verified by constructing MOSFET devices. These findings demonstrate the considerable potential of machine&#8208;learning techniques for screening high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials and constructing HP 2D semiconductor devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Mesoporous Metal Nanocavities for Concurrent Electrocatalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia Coupled with Polyethylene Terephthalate Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO3&#8722; and polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and GA is disclosed in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals from waste pollutants in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Living Polymer Networks with Adaptive Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores carbazole&#8208;based thiuram disulfides (CTDs) as dynamic linkages in light&#8208;induced living (LIL) polymer networks, showcasing their dual reactivity for reshuffling and initiating polymerization under blue light irradiation. CTDs rapidly respond to visible light, enabling shape manipulation, healing, and chain extension in optically opaque polymer networks. This strategy offers new possibilities for LIL polymer networks with adaptive functional properties.








Abstract
The advent of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) through the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds has led to unprecedented properties of macromolecular systems, which can be engineered at the molecular level. Among the various types of stimuli that can be used to trigger chemical changes within polymer networks, light stands out for its remote and spatiotemporal control under ambient conditions. However, most examples of photoactive CANs need to be transparent and they exhibit slow response, side reactions, and limited light penetration. In this vein, it is interesting to&#160;understand how molecular engineering of optically active dynamic linkages that offer fast response to visible light can impart &#8220;living&#8221; characteristics to CANs, especially in opaque systems. Here, the use of carbazole&#8208;based thiuram disulfides (CTDs) that offer dual reactivity as photoactivated reshuffling linkages and iniferters under visible light irradiation is reported. The fast response to visible light activation of the CTDs leads to temporal control of shape manipulation, healing, and chain extension in the polymer networks, despite the lack of optical transparency. This strategy charts a promising avenue for manipulating multifunctional photoactivated CANs in a controlled manner.

A novel hybrid electrolytes strategy enabled by under&#8208;liquid dual super&#8208;lyophobic membrane&#8208;based separator to break the incompatibility of ester/ether&#8208;based electrolytes between high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li anode.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes and related aqueous rechargeable batteries own unique advantage on safety and environmental friendliness, but coupling high energy density Li&#8208;metal batteries with aqueous electrolyte still represent challenging and not yet reported. Here, this work makes a breakthrough in &#8220;high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;metal batteries&#8221; (HVALMBs) by adopting a brilliant hybrid&#8208;electrolytes strategy. Concentrated ternary&#8208;salts ether&#8208;based electrolyte (CTE) acts as the anolyte to ensure the stability and reversibility of Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Eco&#8208;friendly water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WiS) electrolyte acts as catholyte to support the healthy operation of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Most importantly, the aqueous catholyte and non&#8208;aqueous anolyte are isolated in each independent chamber without any crosstalk. Aqueous catholyte permeation toward Li anode can be completely prohibited without proton&#8208;induced corrosion, which is enabled by the introduction of under&#8208;liquid dual super&#8208;lyophobic membrane&#8208;based separator, which can realize the segregation of the most effective immiscible electrolytes with a surface tension difference as small as 6 mJ m&#8722;2. As a result, the aqueous electrolyte can be successfully coupled with Li&#8208;metal anode and achieve the fabrication of HVALMBs (hybrid&#8208;electrolytes system), which presents long&#8208;term cycle stability with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 300 cycles (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 || Li (limited) cell) and high energy density (682&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on dipole interaction between super&#8208;ionic conductive soft filler (Li+ conductivity nanocellulose, Li&#8208;NC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) is constructed. The anchoring effect of Li&#8208;NC prevents local concentration polarization in TDCT. An integrated electrode design effectively enhances the Li+ transport at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: 1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; 2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nanocellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, is introduced which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhances Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8211;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes&#8217; design enables stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries at room temperature.

         <title>Microscale Chiral Rectennas for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale wireless rectifiers built on single chiral tellurium (Te) break current limitations in powering &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices. Unlike traditional Schottky diodes, these rectifiers operate in the radiofrequency range at ultra&#8208;low powers by exploiting Te non&#8208;linear conductivity. They also offer unprecedented rectification tuneability by electrostatic gating. This breakthrough promises micrometer&#8208;scale, single&#8208;material wireless rectifiers, revolutionizing IoT power solutions.









Abstract
Wireless radiofrequency rectifiers have the potential to power the billions of &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices currently in use by effectively harnessing ambient electromagnetic radiation. However, the current technology relies on the implementation of rectifiers based on Schottky diodes, which exhibit limited capabilities for high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;power applications. Consequently, they require an antenna to capture the incoming signal and amplify the input power, thereby limiting the possibility of miniaturizing devices to the millimeter scale. Here, the authors report wireless rectification at the GHz range in a microscale device built on single chiral tellurium with extremely low input powers. By studying the crystal symmetry and the temperature dependence of the rectification, the authors demonstrate that its origin is the intrinsic nonlinear conductivity of the material. Additionally, the unprecedented ability to modulate the rectification output by an electrostatic gate is shown. These results open the path to developing tuneable microscale wireless rectifiers with a single material.

         <title>Constructing Bipolar Dual&#8208;Active Sites through High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Induced Electric Dipole Transition for Decoupling Oxygen Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy FeCoNiMnCrO exhibits a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Coth sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on Nioh sites compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides, which is resulted from the low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites generated by the severe lattice distortion.








Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct active sites to break the trade&#8208;off between oxidation and reduction processes occurring in battery cathodes with conversion mechanism, especially for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) involved in the zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Here, using a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;driven electric dipole transition strategy to activate and stabilize the tetrahedral sites is proposed, while enhancing the activity of octahedral sites through orbital hybridization in a FeCoNiMnCrO spinel oxide, thus constructing bipolar dual&#8208;active sites with high&#8208;low valence states, which can effectively decouple ORR/OER. The FeCoNiMnCrO high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with severe lattice distortion, exhibits a strong 1s&#8594;4s electric dipole transition and intense t2g(Co)/eg(Ni)&#8208;2p(OL) orbital hybridization that regulates the electronic descriptors, eg and t2g, which leads to the formation of low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites (Coth) and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites (Nioh), resulting in a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Coth sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on Nioh sites as well as a superior performance of ZABs compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides. Therefore, entropy engineering presents a distinctive approach for designing catalytic sites by inducing novel electromagnetic properties in materials across various electrocatalytic reactions, particularly for decoupling systems.

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Natural, Organic Emitters and Their Application in Industrially Compostable Programmable Luminescent Tags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design is presented for programmable luminescent tags fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use materials allowing for waste&#8208;free information storage. Cinchonine embedded in polylactic acid as host material provides sufficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for easy readout even under continuous&#8208;wave illumination. Exceval is used as oxygen blocking layer to locally control the oxygen&#8208;sensitive RTP emission for high&#8208;resolution writing of information.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors provide the potential of biodegradable technologies, but prototypes do only rarely exist. Transparent, ultrathin programmable luminescent tags (PLTs) are presented for minimalistic yet efficient information storage that are fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use materials (bioPLTs). As natural emitters, the quinoline alkaloids show sufficient room temperature phosphorescence when being embedded in polymer matrices with cinchonine exhibiting superior performance. Polylactic acid provides a solution for both the matrix material and the flexible substrate.

     alt="Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Natural, Organic Emitters and Their Application in Industrially Compostable Programmable Luminescent Tags"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design is presented for programmable luminescent tags fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready-to-use materials allowing for waste-free information storage. Cinchonine embedded in polylactic acid as host material provides sufficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for easy readout even under continuous-wave illumination. Exceval is used as oxygen blocking layer to locally control the oxygen-sensitive RTP emission for high-resolution writing of information.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconductors provide the potential of biodegradable technologies, but prototypes do only rarely exist. Transparent, ultrathin programmable luminescent tags (PLTs) are presented for minimalistic yet efficient information storage that are fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready-to-use materials (bioPLTs). As natural emitters, the quinoline alkaloids show sufficient room temperature phosphorescence when being embedded in polymer matrices with cinchonine exhibiting superior performance. Polylactic acid provides a solution for both the matrix material and the flexible substrate. Room temperature phosphorescence can be locally controlled by the oxygen concentration in the film by using Exceval as additional oxygen blocking layers. These bioPLTs exhibit all function-defining characteristics also found in their regular nonenvironmentally degradable analogs and, additionally, provide a simplified, high-contrast readout under continuous-wave illumination as a consequence of the unique luminescence properties of the natural emitter cinchonine. Limitations for flexible devices arise from limited thermal stability of the polylactic acid foil used as substrate allowing only for one writing cycle and preventing an annealing step during fabrication. Few-cycle reprogramming is possible when using the architecture of the bioPLTs on regular quartz substrates. This work realizes the versatile platform of PLTs with less harmful materials offering more sustainable use in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the highly transparent PS platform, the liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s (epoxy) can be noncontact split with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source. Compared with commercial pipettes or droppers (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate PS platform (&gt;83.5%) shows great potential in the quantification of highly viscous liquids.








Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide&#8208;ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt;100&#160;mPa s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform is provided to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt;80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) is self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows great potential in adhesive systems (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Phase&#8208;Centric MOCVD Enabled Synthetic Approaches for Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Tin Selenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With phase&#8208;tailored synthetic strategies, wafer&#8208;scale production of tin selenides in the 2D limit is achieved via a low&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. Directly grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 exhibits outstanding crystallinity and tunable thickness, and SnSe, which has intrinsic limitations for 2D film growth, can be prepared via a phase transition, thereby retaining all of the advantages in the MOCVD&#8208;grown product.








Abstract
Following an initial nucleation stage at the flake level, atomically thin film growth of a van der Waals material is promoted by ultrafast lateral growth and prohibited vertical growth. To produce these highly anisotropic films, synthetic or post&#8208;synthetic modifications are required, or even a combination of both, to ensure large&#8208;area, pure&#8208;phase, and low&#8208;temperature deposition. A set of synthetic strategies is hereby presented to selectively produce wafer&#8208;scale tin selenides, SnSex (both x&#160;=&#160;1 and 2), in the 2D forms. The 2D&#8208;SnSe2 films with tuneable thicknesses are directly grown via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 200&#160;&#176;C, and they exhibit outstanding crystallinities and phase homogeneities and consistent film thickness across the entire wafer. This is enabled by excellent control of the volatile metal&#8211;organic precursors and decoupled dual&#8208;temperature regimes for high&#8208;temperature ligand cracking and low&#8208;temperature growth. In contrast, SnSe, which intrinsically inhibited from 2D growth, is indirectly prepared by a thermally driven phase transition of an as&#8208;grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 film with all the benefits of the MOCVD technique. It is accompanied by the electronic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type crossover at the wafer scale. These tailor&#8208;made synthetic routes will accelerate the low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget production of multiphase 2D materials in a reliable and scalable fashion.

Abstract
Advancing biofabrication towards manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue&#8208;like, cell&#8208;dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made towards this goal, and relatively high cell densities have been achieved, surpassing the limited cell densities of conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries a step closer to achieving tissue&#8208;like cell densities. On this focus, herein we discuss the overarching challenges in the bioprocessing of cell&#8208;rich living inks into clinically&#8208;grade engineered tissues, as well as highlight the most recent advances in cell&#8208;rich living ink formulations and their processing technologies. Additionally, an overview of the foreseen developments in the field is provided and critically discussed.

         <title>Microneedle&#8208;mediated Delivery of Immunomodulators Restores Immune Privilege in Hair Follicles and Reverses Immune&#8208;Mediated Alopecia</title>

Abstract
Disorders in the regulatory arm of the adaptive immune system result in autoimmune&#8208;mediated diseases. While systemic immunosuppression is the prevailing approach to manage them, it fails to achieve long&#8208;lasting remission due to concomitant suppression of the regulatory arm and carries the risk of heightened susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Alopecia Areata is a condition characterized by localized hair loss due to autoimmunity. The accessibility of the skin provides an opportunity for local rather than systemic intervention to avoid broad immunosuppression. We hypothesized that expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the immune balance and generate a long&#8208;lasting tolerogenic response. We therefore utilized a hydrogel microneedle (MN) patch for delivery of CCL22, a chemoattractant for Tregs, and IL&#8208;2, a Treg&#160;survival factor to amplify them. In an immune&#8208;mediated murine model of alopecia, we showed local bolstering of Treg&#160;numbers leading to sustained hair regrowth and attenuation of inflammatory pathways. In a humanized skin transplant mouse model, we confirmed expansion of Tregs&#160;within human skin without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. The MN patch offered high&#8208;loading capacity and shelf&#8208;life stability for prospective clinical translation. By harmonizing immune responses locally, we aspire to reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.

         <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps&#8208;Inhibiting and Fouling&#8208;Resistant Polysulfoxides Potently Prevent Postoperative Adhesion, Tumor Recurrence and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET&#8208;targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, we synthesized and screened one type of sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling&#8208;resistant and NET&#8208;inhibiting capabilities. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior non&#8208;fouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&#8211; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO&#8211; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5&#8208;Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS&#8208;induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET-targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, we synthesized and screened one type of sulfoxide-containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling-resistant and NET-inhibiting capabilities. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior non-fouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5-Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS-induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Helicoidal Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Compartment Assemblies with Tunable Chiroptical Properties</title>

Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based nanocomposites are highly appealing for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable functional materials. Although many advances have been made in this direction, the true potential of fibrillar nanocomposites has yet to be realized because available fabrication approaches are inadequate for achieving precise structural control at the sub&#8208;micrometer scale. Here a spray&#8208;assisted alignment methodology of cellulose nanofibrils is combined with the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly into an additive manufacturing process in which the alignment direction of each cellulose layer is rationally selected to achieve thin films with a helicoidal arrangement of the nanofibrils. The helicoidal structure of the films is verified by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) of the samples. The sign and position of the structural CD peak show that the handedness and the pitch of the chiral structures can be easily tuned by deliberately selecting simple parameters, such as the number of consecutive cellulose layers sprayed in the same direction, and the angle of rotation between successive stacks of layers. To our knowledge, our approach is unique as it offers the possibility to prepare complex nanocomposite architectures with various nanoscale&#8208;controlled sub&#8208;structures from different anisometric objects, which is enabling novel designs of composite films with damage&#8208;resistant and/or optical filtering functionalities.

         <title>Entangled Mesh Hydrogels with Macroporous Topologies via Cryogelation for Rapid Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising technology to alleviate freshwater scarcity. Recently, hygroscopic salt&#8208;hydrogel composites (HSHCs) have emerged as attractive candidates with their high water uptake, versatile designability, and scale&#8208;up fabrication. However, achieving high&#8208;performance SAWH applications for HSHCs has been challenging because of their sluggish kinetics, attributed to their limited mass transport properties. Herein, a universal network engineering of hydrogels using a cryogelation method is presented, significantly improving the SAWH kinetics of HSHCs. As a result of the entangled mesh confinements formed during cryogelation, a stable macroporous topology is attained and maintained within the obtained entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs), leading to significantly enhanced mass transport properties compared to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs). With it, corresponding hygroscopic EMHs (HEMHs) simultaneously exhibit faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption. Consequently, a rapid&#8208;cycling HEMHs&#8208;based harvester delivers a practical freshwater production of 2.85 Lwater kgsorbents&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 via continuous eight sorption/desorption cycles, outperforming other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogel&#8208;based sorbents. Significantly, the generalizability of this strategy has been validated by extending it to other hydrogels used in HSHCs. Overall, this work offers a new approach to efficiently address long&#8208;standing challenges of sluggish kinetics in current HSHCs, promoting them toward the next&#8208;generation SAWH applications.

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Mono&#8208;Layered Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Simulated Flue Gas Photoreduction</title>

Abstract
The dilemma between the thickness and accessible active site triggers the design of porous crystalline materials with mono&#8208;layered structure for advanced photo&#8208;catalysis applications. Here, we report a kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) through the exfoliation of a specifically designed Co3 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The sub&#8208;nanometer thickness and inherent light&#8208;sensitivity endow Co&#8208;MOF MNSs with fully exposed Janus Co3 sites that can selectively photo&#8208;reduce CO2 into formic acid under simulated flue gas. Notably, the production efficiency of formic acid by Co&#8208;MOF MNSs (0.85&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is &#8764;13 times higher than that of bulk counterpart (0.065&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) under simulated flue gas atmosphere, which is highest in reported works up to date. Theoretical calculations prove that the exposed Janus Co3 sites with simultaneously available sites possess higher activity when compared with single Co site, validating the importance of mono&#8208;layered nanosheet morphology. Our results might facilitate the development of functional nanosheet materials for CO2 photo&#8208;reduction in potential flue gas treatment.

         <title>Bistable Electrochromic Ionogels via Supramolecular Interactions for Energy&#8208;Efficient Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bistable electrochromic (EC) materials and systems offer significant potential for building decarbonization through their optical modulation and energy efficiency. However, challenges such as limited design strategies and bottlenecks in cost, fabrication, and color have hindered the full commercialization of energy&#8208;saving EC windows and displays, with few materials achieving true bistability. Herein, a novel strategy for designing bistable electrochromic materials is proposed by leveraging supramolecular interactions. These interactions facilitate reversible color transitions, stabilize the colored structure, and enable spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion, thereby achieving bistable electrochromism. The mechanisms and materials underlying these unconventional electrochromic systems are substantiated through detailed characterization. This strategy enables the preparation of low&#8208;cost and sustainable transparent electrochromic displays with high performance. Notably, the display information remains clearly visible for more than 2 hours without consuming energy. Involving biomass materials and removable device structures also enhances the sustainability and scalability of EC technology applications and development. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of supramolecular chemistry in the development of cutting&#8208;edge materials for applications such as energy&#8208;saving smart windows.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Enhancing Temperature Tolerance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based batteries (LBBs) are highly researched and recognized as a mature electrochemical energy storage (EES) system in recent years. However, their stability and effectiveness are primarily confined to room temperature conditions. At temperatures significantly below 0&#160;&#176;C or above 60&#160;&#176;C, LBBs experience substantial performance degradation. Under such challenging extreme contexts, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising complementary technology, distinguished by their fast dynamics at low temperature region and superior safety under elevated temperatures. Notably, developing SIBs suitable for wide&#8208;temperature usage still presents significant challenges, particularly for specific applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and deep&#8208;space/polar explorations, which requires a thorough understanding of how SIBs perform under different temperature conditions. By reviewing the development of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, we systematically and comprehensively analyze the influence of temperature on the parameters related to battery performance, such as reaction constant, charge transfer resistance, etc. The review emphasizes challenges encountered by SIBs in both low and high temperatures while exploring recent advancements in SIB materials, specifically focusing on strategies to enhance battery performance across diverse temperature ranges. Overall, insights gained from these studies will drive the development of SIBs that can handle the challenges posed by diverse and harsh climates.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces around the Anode towards Practical Alkali Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts were devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive atmospheric gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, we have a critical review of the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating novel electrolytes to build protective interphases and alleviate corrosive attacks, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, we highlight the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for A Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8208;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, we systematically investigate the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers and develop a series of robust PCs via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment at high temperatures. Based on this versatile PCs platform, we demonstrate the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m and Fd3&#175;$\bar{3}$m), tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm) and periodicity (36.1&#8211;92.4&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have advantages of highly opened continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances towards hydrogen sulfide, a typical toxic gas that threatens the environment.

         <title>Lamellar Nanoporous Metal/Intermetallic Compound Heterostructure Regulating Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electrodeposition for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure electrodes with high electron/ion transportability and abundant zincophilic sites are constructed as high&#8208;performance anode host materials for wide&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc ion batteries. Benefiting from the unique metal/intermetallic compound heterostructure to form local galvanic couples to facilitate Zn nucleation and deposition, nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu electrode exhibits ultralong&#8208;lifespan stability at 25 and &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are attractive post&#8208;lithium battery technologies for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their inherent safety, low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, their practical implementation in wide&#8208;temperature surroundings persistently confronts irregular zinc electrodeposits and parasitic side reactions on metal anode, which leads to poor rechargeability, low Coulombic efficiency and short lifespan. Here, this work reports lamellar nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure electrode as a promising anode host material to regulate high&#8208;efficiency and dendrite&#8208;free zinc electrodeposition and stripping for wide&#8208;temperatures aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In this unique electrode, the interconnective Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure ligaments not only facilitate fast electron transfer but work as highly zincophilic sites for zinc nucleation and deposition by virtue of local galvanic couples while the interpenetrative lamellar channels serving as mass transport pathways. As a result, it exhibits exceptional zinc plating/stripping behaviors in aqueous hybrid electrolyte of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate at wide temperatures ranging from 25 to &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, with ultralow voltage polarizations at various current densities and ultralong lifespan of &gt;4000 h. The outstanding electrochemical properties enlist full cell of zinc&#8208;ion batteries constructed with nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu and ZnxV2O5/C to maintain high capacity and excellent stability for &gt;5000 cycles at 25 and &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Supergravity&#8208;Steered Generic Manufacturing of Nanosheets&#8208;Embedded Nanocomposite Hydrogel with Highly Oriented, Heterogeneous Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supergravity&#8208;steered approach is designed to manipulate the assembly of arbitrary nanosheets from MXene to MoS2, GO, and C3N4 for fabricating oriented nanocomposite hydrogels with heterogeneous architecture. The resultant MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels showcase an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 55.2&#160;dB yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials.








Abstract
Designing nanocomposite hydrogels with oriented nanosheets has emerged as a promising toolkit to achieve preferential performances that go beyond their disordered counterparts. Although current fabrication strategies via electric/magnetic force fields have made remarkable achievements, they necessitate special properties of nanosheets and suffer from an inferior orientation degree of nanosheets. Herein, a facile and universal approach is discovered to elaborate MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels with highly oriented, heterogeneous architecture by virtue of supergravity to replace conventional force fields. The key to such architecture is to leverage bidirectional, force&#8208;tunable attributes of supergravity containing coupled orthogonal shear and centrifugal force field for steering high&#8208;efficient movement, pre&#8208;orientation, and stacking of MXene nanosheets in the bottom. Such a synergetic effect allows for yielding heterogeneous nanocomposite hydrogels with a high&#8208;orientation MXene&#8208;rich layer (orientation degree, f = 0.83) and a polymer&#8208;rich layer. The authors demonstrate that MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels leverage their high&#8208;orientation, heterogeneous architecture to deliver an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 55.2&#160;dB at 12.4&#160;GHz yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials. This versatile supergravity&#8208;steered strategy can be further extended to arbitrary nanosheets including MoS2, GO, and C3N4, offering a paradigm in the development of oriented nanocomposites.

         <title>In Situ Polymerization Facilitating Practical High&#8208;Safety Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are gaining widespread attention as a promising solution to improve battery safety performance. However, the safety improvement and the underlying mechanisms of QSSBs remain elusive. Herein, a novel strategy combining high&#8208;safety ethylene carbonate&#8208;free liquid electrolyte and in situ polymerization technique is proposed to prepare practical QSSBs. The Ah&#8208;level QSSBs with LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode and graphite&#8208;silicon anode demonstrate significantly improved safety features without sacrificing electrochemical performance. As evidenced by accelerating rate calorimetry tests, the QSSBs exhibit increased self&#8208;heating temperature and onset temperature (T2), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The T2 has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot&#8208;box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high&#8208;safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot-box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in-situ-formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high-safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high-energy-density batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Area&#8208;Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an area&#8208;selective chemical vapor deposition of gold is demonstrated. A metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 is used to create an autocatalytically active seed layer by electron beam deposition for further film growth at sub&#8208;100&#160;&#176;C temperatures. In addition, this process provides a novel method for determining local temperature increases during electron beam writing.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high&#8208;purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre&#8208; and post&#8208;processing using a mask to produce structures. This study presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area&#8208;selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD process without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80&#160;&#176;C, over 200&#160;K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of &#8776;40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, by using the onset of the autocatalytic CVD growth, for the first time the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam can be precisely&#160;determined.

         <title>Toward Ultrahigh Rate and Cycling Performance of Cathode Materials of Sodium Ion Battery by Introducing a Bicontinuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered bicontinuous porous structure is introduced into Prussian blue analogues (PBA) by using polymer cubosomes as the template. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ diffusion and the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBA cathodes exhibit ultrahigh rate performance (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.5 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (&gt;3000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.5 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (&gt;3000 circulations at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA&#8208;based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes&#8217; failure due to high&#8208;stress concentration upon ion storage.

         <title>A Boron, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Pure Blue Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitter for Organic Light Emitting Diodes That Shows Fast kRISC Without the Use of Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A narrowband pure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter that shows record fast kRISC on the order of 106 s&#8722;1 is demonstrated. The emitter maintains its high performance in an OLED, which shows an EQEmax of &#8776;20% and a CIEy of 0.041, matching the Rec. BT.2020&#8208;2 color point for blue.








Abstract
Narrowband emissive multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are a promising solution to achieve the current industry&#8208;targeted color standard, Rec. BT.2020&#8208;2, for blue color without using optical filters, aiming for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, their long triplet lifetimes, largely affected by their slow reverse intersystem crossing rates, adversely affect device stability. In this study, a helical MR&#8208;TADF emitter (f&#8208;DOABNA) is designed and synthesized. Owing to its &#960;&#8208;delocalized structure, f&#8208;DOABNA possesses a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap, &#916;EST, and displays simultaneously an exceptionally faster reverse intersystem crossing rate constant, kRISC, of up to 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 and a very high photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL, of over 90% in both solution and doped films. The OLED with f&#8208;DOABNA as the emitter achieved a narrow deep&#8208;blue emission at 445&#160;nm (full width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#160;nm) associated with Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.041), and showed a high maximum external quantum efficiency, EQEmax, of &#8776;20%.

         <title>Recent Advances of Green Electricity Generation: Potential in Solar Interfacial Evaporation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, insights into the remarkable advancements and potential of interfacial evaporation for water&#8211;electricity cogeneration (WEC) are provided. The existing literature is critically analyzed, highlighting its limitations in fully exploring the synergistic potential between interfacial evaporation and WEC. Additionally, the need for further research to optimize material selection, thermal management, and water management is emphasized.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has played a pivotal role in optimizing water&#8208;energy utilization, reducing conventional power costs, and mitigating environmental impacts. The increasing emphasis on the synergistic cogeneration of water and green electricity through SDIE is particularly noteworthy. However, there is a gap of existing reviews that have focused on the mechanistic understanding of green power from water&#8208;electricity cogeneration (WEC) systems, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between efficiency of green energy utilization in WEC and material design in SDIE. Particularly, it lacks a comprehensive discussion to address the challenges faced in these areas along with potential solutions. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively assess the progress and future perspective of green electricity from WEC systems by investigating the potential expansion of SDIE. First, it provides a comprehensive overview about material rational design, thermal management, and water transportation tunnels in SDIE. Then, it summarizes diverse energy sources utilized in the SDIE process, including steaming generation, photovoltaics, salinity gradient effect, temperature gradient effect, and piezoelectric effect. Subsequently, it explores factors that affect generated green electricity efficiency in WEC. Finally, this review proposes challenges and possible solution in the development of WEC.

         <title>Uncovering the Network Modifier for Highly Disordered Amorphous Li&#8208;Garnet Glass&#8208;Ceramics</title>

This work examines the hypothesis of whether La, as a network modifier in amorphous Li7La3Zr2O12 (aLLZO), can be used to modulate the structure of aLLZO. The results suggest, within the solubility limit of La in aLLZO, a higher La concentration can lead to a more disordered medium&#8208; and long&#8208;range order structure in LLZO.








Abstract
Highly disordered amorphous Li7La3Zr2O12 (aLLZO) is a promising class of electrolyte separators and protective layers for hybrid or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to its grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature and wide electrochemical stability window. Unlike low&#8208;entropy ionic glasses such as LixPOyNz (LiPON), these medium&#8208;entropy non&#8208;Zachariasen aLLZO phases offer a higher number of stable structure arrangements over a wide range of tunable synthesis temperatures, providing the potential to tune the LBU&#8208;Li+ transport relation. It is revealed that lanthanum is the active &#8220;network modifier&#8221; for this new class of highly disordered Li+ conductors, whereas zirconium and lithium serve as &#8220;network formers&#8221;. Specifically, within the solubility limit of La in aLLZO, increasing the La concentration can result in longer bond distances between the first nearest neighbors of Zr&#9472;O and La&#9472;O within the same local building unit (LBU) and the second nearest neighbors of Zr&#9472;La across two adjacent network&#8208;former and network&#8208;modifier LBUs, suggesting a more disordered medium&#8208; and long&#8208;range order structure in LLZO. These findings open new avenues for future designs of amorphous Li+ electrolytes and the selection of network&#8208;modifier dopants. Moreover, the wide yet relatively low synthesis temperatures of these glass&#8208;ceramics make them attractive candidates for low&#8208;cost and more sustainable hybrid&#8208; or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for energy storage.

         <title>Nerve Visualization using Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores to Guide Prostatectomy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying nerves during prostatectomy poses a significant challenge due to their small size, translucency, and narrowness of the pelvis. To address this issue, a library of nerve&#8208;specific fluorophores based on a phenoxazine scaffold has been developed. Formulated derivatives have been shown to be compatible with the robotic&#8208;assisted da Vinci system, allowing for high&#8208;fidelity imaging of prostatic nerves during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery (FGS) is poised to revolutionize surgical medicine through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores for tissue&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific contrast. Clinical open and laparoscopic FGS vision systems operate nearly exclusively at NIR wavelengths. However, tissue&#8208;specific NIR contrast agents compatible with clinically available imaging systems are lacking, leaving nerve tissue identification during prostatectomy a persistent challenge. Here, it is shown that combining drug&#8208;like molecular design concepts and fluorophore chemistry enabled the production of a library of NIR phenoxazine&#8208;based fluorophores for intraoperative nerve&#8208;specific imaging. The lead candidate readily delineated prostatic nerves in the canine and iliac plexus in the swine using the clinical da Vinci Surgical System that has been popularized for minimally invasive prostatectomy procedures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of molecular engineering of NIR nerve&#8208;binding fluorophores for ready integration into the existing surgical workflow, paving the path for clinical translation to reduce morbidity from nerve injury for prostate cancer patients.

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast and Asymmetric Solvent Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by graded porous structures in glomerular filtration membranes, a series of gradient covalent organic framework membranes (GCOMx) are fabricated through a universal synthetic route. The GCOMx exhibit an unprecedented asymmetric solvent transport when applying different membrane sides as the solvent feed surface during filtration. In addition, GCOMx shows significant filtration performance in simulated kidney dialysis, revealing great potential of GCOMx in bionic applications, such as recontamination prevention or unidirectional water retention.








Abstract
Gradients play a pivotal role in membrane technologies, e.g., osmotic energy conversion, desalination, biomimetic actuation, selective separation, and more. In these applications, the compositional gradients are of great relevance for successful function implementation, ranging from solvent separation to smart devices; However, the construction of functional gradient in membranes is still challenging both in scale and directions. Inspired by the specific function&#8208;related, graded porous structures in glomerular filtration membranes, a general approach for constructing gradient covalent organic framework membranes (GCOMx) applying poly (ionic liquid)s (PILs)&#160;as template is reported here. With graded distribution of highly porous covalent organic framework (COF) crystals along the membrane, GCOMx exhibts an unprecedented asymmetric solvent transport when applying different membrane sides as the solvent feed surface during filtration, leading to a much&#8208;enhanced flux (10&#8211;18 times) of the &#8220;large&#8208;to&#8208;small&#8221; pore flow comparing to the reverse direction, verified by hydromechanical theoretical calculations. Upon systematic experiments, GCOMx achieves superior permeance in nonpolar (hexane&#160;&#8776;260.45 LMH bar&#8722;1) and polar (methanol&#160;&#8776;175.93 LMH bar&#8722;1) solvents, together with narrow molecular weight cut&#8208;off (MWCO, 472&#160;g mol&#8722;1) and molecular weight retention onset (MWRO, &lt;182&#160;g mol&#8722;1). Interestingly, GCOMx shows significant filtration performance in simulated kidney dialysis, revealing great potential of GCOMx in bionic applications.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silk Fibroin/Cryogel Hybrid Dual Fiber Scaffold with Hierarchical Structure Promotes Healing of Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AP1 peptide conjugated&#8208;silk fibroin/cryogel hybrid dual fiber scaffold exhibits superior granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re&#8208;epithelialization during the proliferative phase compared to the commercial product PELNAC.








Abstract
Chronic wounds resulting from diabetes, pressure, radiation therapy, and other factors continue to pose significant challenges in wound healing. To address this, this study introduces a novel hybrid fibroin fibrous scaffold (FFS) comprising randomly arranged fibroin fibers and vertically aligned cryogel fibers (CFs). The fibroin scaffold is efficiently degummed at room temperature and simultaneously formed a porous structure. The aligned CFs are produced via directional freeze&#8208;drying, achieved by controlling solution concentration and freezing polymerization temperature. The incorporation of aligned CFs into the expanded fibroin fiber scaffold leads to enhanced cell infiltration both in vitro and in vivo, further elevating the hybrid scaffold's tissue compatibility. The anti&#8208;inflammatory peptide 1 (AP&#8208;1) is also conjugated to the hybrid fibrous scaffold, effectively transforming the inflammatory status of chronic wounds from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;reparative. Consequently, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group demonstrates superior granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re&#8208;epithelialization during the proliferative phase compared to the commercial product PELNAC. Moreover, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group displays epidermis thickness, number of regenerated hair follicles, and collagen density closer to normal skin tissue. These findings highlight the potential of random fibroin fibers/aligned CFs hybrid fibrous scaffold as a promising approach for skin tissue filling and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Entropy Tape Electrolytes for Compression&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced tape electrolyte is realized by harnessing high&#8208;entropy condensed microstructures of polymers. The high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte brings a promising solution to not only the challenging interface issues in solid&#8208;state batteries, but also future flexible energy storage devices.








Abstract
Advanced solid electrolytes with strong adhesion to other components are the key for the successes of solid&#8208;state batteries. Unfortunately, traditional solid electrolytes have to work under high compression to maintain the contact inside owing to their poor adhesion. Here, a concept of high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte (HETE) is proposed to simultaneously achieve tape&#8208;like adhesion, liquid&#8208;like ion conduction, and separator&#8208;like mechanical properties. This HETE is designed with adhesive skin layer on both sides and robust skeleton layer in the middle. The significant properties of the three layers are enabled by high&#8208;entropy microstructures which are realized by harnessing polymer&#8211;ion interactions. As a result, the HETE shows high ionic conductivity (3.50 &#177; 0.53 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good mechanical properties (toughness 11.28 &#177; 1.12&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, strength 8.18 &#177; 0.28&#160;MPa), and importantly, tape&#8208;like adhesion (interfacial toughness 231.6 &#177; 9.6 J m&#8722;2). Moreover, a compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape battery is finally demonstrated by adhesion&#8208;based assembling, which shows good interfacial and electrochemical stability even under harsh mechanical conditions, such as twisting and bending. The concept of HETE and compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape batteries may bring promising solutions and inspiration to conquer the interface challenges in solid&#8208;state batteries and their manufacturing.

         <title>Sticky and Strain&#8208;Gradient Artificial Epineurium for Sutureless Nerve Repair in Rodents and Nonhuman Primates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key feature in the materials design of wet adhesive, &#8220;a sticky and strain&#8208;gradient artificial epineurium (SSGAE) with skin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structure entailing strain&#8208;gradient layers, Janus hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces, and even self&#8208;healing property&#8221;, which enables immediate and stable neurorrhaphy, is reported.








Abstract
The need for the development of soft materials capable of stably adhering to nerve tissues without any suturing followed by additional damages is at the fore at a time when success in postoperative recovery depends largely on the surgical experience and/or specialized microsuturing skills of the surgeon. Despite fully recognizing such prerequisite conditions, designing the materials with robust adhesion to wet nerves as well as acute/chronic anti&#8208;inflammation remains to be resolved. Herein, a sticky and strain&#8208;gradient artificial epineurium (SSGAE) that overcomes the most critically challenging aspect for realizing sutureless repair of severely injured nerves is presented. In this regard, the SSGAE with a skin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structure entailing strain&#8208;gradient layers, anisotropic Janus layers including hydrophobic top and hydrophilic bottom surfaces, and synergistic self&#8208;healing capabilities enables immediate and stable neurorrhaphy in both rodent and nonhuman primate models, indicating that the bioinspired materials strategy significantly contributes to translational medicine for effective peripheral nerve repair.

         <title>Phase Selection Rules of Multi&#8208;Principal Element Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase selection rules and physical understanding are formed based on a comprehensive data set including 378 binary, 3276 ternary, and 20475 quaternary equal&#8208;molar alloys. A global phenomenological descriptor &#964; = &#8197;VEC&#8197; &#215; &#8197;(VECstd + VEC) + log(&#967;ave)3$\sqrt[3]{{{\mathrm{log}}( {{\chi }_{{\mathrm{ave}}}} )}}$ is developed which is more effective than VEC in both accuracy and predicting HCP phase and offers insights for MPEA design.








Abstract
Computational prediction of phase stability of multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) holds a lot of promise for rapid exploration of the enormous design space and autonomous discovery of superior structural and functional properties. Regardless of many plausible works that rely on phenomenological theory and machine learning, precise prediction is still limited by insufficient data and the lack of interpretability of some machine learning algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural network. In this work, a comprehensive approach is presented, encompassing the development of a complete dataset that contains 72&#160;387 density functional theory calculations, as well as a predictive global phenomenological descriptor. The phase selection descriptor, based on atomic electronegativity and valence electron concentration, significantly outperforms the widely used valence electron concentration, excelling in both accuracy (with an f1 score of 63% compared to 47%) and its ability to predict the HCP phase (0.48 recall compared to 0). The comprehensive data mining on the global design space of 61&#160;425 quaternary MPEAs made from 28 possible metals, together with the phenomenological theory and physical interpretation, will set up a solid computational science foundation for data&#8208;driven exploration of MPEAs.

         <title>Myeloid Cell&#8208;Triggered In Situ Cell Engineering for Robust Vaccine&#8208;Based Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable scaffold for in situ myeloid cell engineering and antigen loading is designed. Antigens are modified on the scaffold, thus cells can effectively load antigens through cell membrane thiol groups. Additionally, various adjuvants are screened to promote the migration and activation of myeloid cells. Activated myeloid cells then function as antigen&#8208;presenting cells to stimulate anti&#8208;tumor response.








Abstract
Following the success of the dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, the cell&#8208;based tumor vaccine shows its promise as a vaccination strategy. Except for DC cells, targeting other immune cells, especially myeloid cells, is expected to address currently unmet clinical needs (e.g., tumor types, safety issues such as cytokine storms, and therapeutic benefits). Here, it is shown that an in situ injected macroporous myeloid cell adoptive scaffold (MAS) not only actively delivers antigens (Ags) that are triggered by scaffold&#8208;infiltrating cell surface thiol groups but also releases granulocyte&#8211;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor and other adjuvant combos. Consequently, this promotes cell differentiation, activation, and migration from the produced monocyte and DC vaccines (MASVax) to stimulate antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Neoantigen&#8208;based MASVax combined with immune checkpoint blockade induces rejection of established tumors and long&#8208;term immune protection. The combined depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells further enhances the efficacy of MASVax, indicating the potential of myeloid cell&#8208;based therapies for immune enhancement and normalization treatment of cancer.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Temperature Lasers Spanning from &#8722;180 to 240 &#176;C Based on Fully&#8208;Polymerized Blue Phase Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a super&#8208;wide lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C (&#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C) for the first time via a well&#8208;designed fully&#8208;polymerized blue phase liquid crystal to reduce the random crystallization and improve system compatibility. The corresponding laser behaviors and mechanisms are investigated, including a blue shifted lasing wavelength, &#8220;U&#8221; shaped threshold, and excellent photothermal/structural stability of the as&#8208;prepared samples.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have potential applications in displays, sensors, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields owing to their outstanding optical properties. However, there remain challenges on lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C, which significantly limits the potential application of BPLC lasers in low&#8208;temperature environments. In this work, BPLC lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C is realized for the first time in a super&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C using a well&#8208;designed fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC system with a narrow line width of 0.0881&#160;nm and a low lasing threshold of 37&#160;nJ&#160;pulse&#8722;1. This fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC both effectively avoids low&#8208;temperature random crystallization and has excellent compatibility with dye molecules that significantly widen the lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C. Besides, the variations of laser peak and threshold are also revealed below 0&#160;&#176;C, that is, redshifted laser wavelength and increased threshold value with decreasing temperature, which contribute to a blue&#8208;shifted laser signal and a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold in &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C. These unique laser behaviors can be ascribed to the temperature&#8208;dependent anisotropically microstructural deformation of the BP lattice. This work not only opens a door to the development of low&#8208;temperature BPLC lasers but also sets out important insights in the design of novel organic optical devices.

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a super-wide lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C (&#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C) for the first time via a well-designed fully-polymerized blue phase liquid crystal to reduce the random crystallization and improve system compatibility. The corresponding laser behaviors and mechanisms are investigated, including a blue shifted lasing wavelength, &#8220;U&#8221; shaped threshold, and excellent photothermal/structural stability of the as-prepared samples.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have potential applications in displays, sensors, and anti-counterfeiting fields owing to their outstanding optical properties. However, there remain challenges on lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C, which significantly limits the potential application of BPLC lasers in low-temperature environments. In this work, BPLC lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C is realized for the first time in a super-wide temperature range of &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C using a well-designed fully-polymerized BPLC system with a narrow line width of 0.0881&#160;nm and a low lasing threshold of 37&#160;nJ&#160;pulse&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This fully-polymerized BPLC both effectively avoids low-temperature random crystallization and has excellent compatibility with dye molecules that significantly widen the lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C. Besides, the variations of laser peak and threshold are also revealed below 0&#160;&#176;C, that is, redshifted laser wavelength and increased threshold value with decreasing temperature, which contribute to a blue-shifted laser signal and a U-shaped lasing threshold in &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C. These unique laser behaviors can be ascribed to the temperature-dependent anisotropically microstructural deformation of the BP lattice. This work not only opens a door to the development of low-temperature BPLC lasers but also sets out important insights in the design of novel organic optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Irradiation Significantly Enhances Capacitive Energy Storage Performance of Polymer Dielectric Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is proposed to improve dielectric energy storage performance of polymers by &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. Utilizing this strategy to the biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), a record&#8208;high energy density of 10.4 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;95% efficiency is achieved, surpassing commercial polymers, reported all&#8208;organic polymers and PP&#8208;based composites. Substantial improvements are also achieved for &#947;&#8208;irradiated cycloolefin copolymer at 150&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectric capacitors are fundamental in advanced electronics and power grids but suffer from low energy density, hindering miniaturization of compact electrical systems. It is shown that high&#8208;energy and strong penetrating &#947;&#8208;irradiation significantly enhances capacitive energy storage performance of polymer dielectrics. &#947;&#8208;irradiated biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films exhibit an extraordinarily high energy density of 10.4 J cm&#8722;3 at 968 MV m&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 97.3%. In particular, an energy density of 4.06 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh efficiency of 98% is reliably maintained through 20&#160;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles under 600 MV m&#8722;1. At 125&#160;&#176;C, the &#947;&#8208;irradiated BOPP film still delivers a high discharged energy density of 5.88 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency of 90% at 770 MV m&#8722;1. Substantial improvements are also achieved for &#947;&#8208;irradiated cycloolefin copolymers at a high temperature of 150&#160;&#176;C, verifying the strategy generalizability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the excellent performance should be related to the &#947;&#8208;irradiation induced polar functional groups with high electron affinity in the molecular chain, which offer deep energy traps to impede charge transport. This work provides a simple and generally applicable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance polymer dielectrics.

         <title>Redox Gating for Colossal Carrier Modulation and Unique Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox gating, distinct from electrolyte gating, combines redox functionalities with ionic electrolytes for power&#8208;efficient electronic phase control, achieving colossal sheet carrier density modulation beyond 1016 cm&#8722;2 in the sub&#8208;volt regime.

Abstract
Redox gating, a novel approach distinct from conventional electrolyte gating, combines reversible redox functionalities with common ionic electrolyte moieties to engineer charge transport, enabling power&#8208;efficient electronic phase control. This study achieves a colossal sheet carrier density modulation beyond 1016 cm&#8722;2, sustainable over thousands of cycles, all within the sub&#8208;volt regime for functional oxide thin films. The key advantage of this method lies in the controlled injection of a large quantity of carriers from the electrolyte into the channel material without the deleterious effects associated with traditional electrolyte gating processes such as the production of ionic defects or intercalated species. The redox gating approach offers a simple and practical means of decoupling electrical and structural phase transitions, enabling the isostructural metal&#8208;insulator transition and improved device endurance. The versatility of redox gating extends across multiple materials, irrespective of their crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, or carrier type (n&#8208; or p&#8208;type). This inclusivity encompasses functional heterostructures and low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials composed of sustainable elements, highlighting the broad applicability and potential of the technique in electronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Oligopeptoplex&#8208;Loaded Dissolving Microneedles for Adipocyte&#8208;Targeted Anti&#8208;Obesity Gene Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Dissolvable hyaluronic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;locking microneedle patch loaded with self&#8208;assembled oligopeptoplex optimized for targeted delivery of FABPs&#8208;silencing shRNA to obese adipocytes represents significant FABPs downregulation in adipose tissue, reduction in body weight, and amelioration of insulin resistance, potentiating it as a novel transdermal gene delivery platform for obesity and obesity&#8208;induced metabolic syndrome.








Abstract
Advancements in gene delivery systems are pivotal for gene&#8208;based therapeutics in oncological, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. This study delineates the design of a self&#8208;assembled oligopeptoplex (SA&#8208;OP) optimized for shRNA delivery to adipocytes, targeting obesity and associated metabolic syndromes. Conventional systems face challenges, including instability due to electrostatic interactions between genetic materials and cationic oligopeptides. Additionally, repeated injections induce discomfort and compromise patient well&#8208;being. To circumvent these issues, a dissolvable hyaluronic acid&#8208;based, self&#8208;locking microneedle (LMN) patch is developed, with improved micro&#8208;dose efficiency, for precise SA&#8208;OP delivery. This platform offers pain&#8208;free administration and improved SA&#8208;OP storage stability. In vitro studies in 3T3&#8208;L1 cells demonstrated improvements in SA&#8208;OP preservation and gene silencing efficacy. In vivo evaluation in a mice model of diet&#8208;induced type 2 diabetes yielded significant gene silencing in adipose tissue and a 21.92 &#177; 2.51% reduction in body weight with minimum relapse risk at 6&#8208;weeks post&#8208;treatment, representing a superior therapeutic efficacy in a truncated timeframe relative to the GLP&#8208;1 analogues currently available on the market. Additionally, SA&#8208;OP (LMN) mitigated insulin resistance, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis. These findings establish SA&#8208;OP (LMN) as a robust, minimally invasive transdermal gene delivery platform with prolonged storage stability for treating obesity and its metabolic comorbidities.

         <title>Interfacial Rivet to Fill Structural Defects: A Spacer Engineering Gift for 3D Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy on the management of grain boundaries in pristine 3D perovskite films based on seed solutions of 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites, and precisely anchored to the grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite. This effective defect management results in an impressive PCE of 25.07%, which has far&#8208;reaching implications for promoting the substantial development of PSCs.








Abstract
The combination of 2D and 3D perovskites to passivate surfaces or interfaces with a high concentration of defects shows great promise for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Constructing high&#8208;quality perovskite film systems by precisely modulating 2D perovskites with good morphologies and growth sites on 3D perovskite films remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of spacer&#8208;engineered surface reactions. In this study, phase&#8208;pure 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with a controlled number of layers (n) are separated on a large scale and exploited as interface rivets to optimize 3D perovskite films, resulting in tunable film structural defects and grain boundaries. The optimized PSCs system benefits from a reduction in non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in improved optical performance, higher mobility, and lower trap density. The corresponding device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%, especially for voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The quality and uniformity of the perovskite films are further confirmed using large&#8208;area devices with an active area of 14 cm2, which exhibits a PCE of more than 21.24%. The high&#8208;quality thin&#8208;film system based on the 2D perovskites presented herein provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

This effective defect management results in an impressive PCE of 25.07%, which has far-reaching implications for promoting the substantial development of PSCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of 2D and 3D perovskites to passivate surfaces or interfaces with a high concentration of defects shows great promise for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Constructing high-quality perovskite film systems by precisely modulating 2D perovskites with good morphologies and growth sites on 3D perovskite films remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of spacer-engineered surface reactions. In this study, phase-pure 2D (HA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MA)&lt;sub&gt;n&#8722;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3n+1&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites with a controlled number of layers (n) are separated on a large scale and exploited as interface rivets to optimize 3D perovskite films, resulting in tunable film structural defects and grain boundaries. The optimized PSCs system benefits from a reduction in non-radiative recombination, resulting in improved optical performance, higher mobility, and lower trap density. The corresponding device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%, especially for voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) and fill factor (FF). The quality and uniformity of the perovskite films are further confirmed using large-area devices with an active area of 14 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which exhibits a PCE of more than 21.24%. The high-quality thin-film system based on the 2D perovskites presented herein provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Empowering CO2 Eco&#8208;Refrigeration With Colossal Breathing&#8208;Caloric&#8208;Like Effects in MOF&#8208;508b</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF&#8208;508b displays enhanced breathing&#8208;caloric&#8208;like effects related to two consecutive phase transitions, where barocaloric effects and sorption thermal changes coexist. Moreover, the first thermometry device to characterize this type of thermomaterials is presented, where MOF&#8208;508b shows remarkable temperature changes of 30 K under CO2 pressurization of only 26 bar, which can empower existing CO2 heating and cooling systems.








Abstract
Today, &#8776;20% of the electric consumption is devoted to refrigeration; while, &#8776;50% of the final energy is dedicated to heating applications. In this scenario, many cooling devices and heat&#8208;pumps are transitioning toward the use of CO2 as an eco&#8208;friendly refrigerant, favoring carbon circular economy. Nevertheless, CO2 still has some limitations, such as large operating pressures (70&#8211;150&#160;bar) and a critical point at 31 &#176;C, which compromises efficiency and increases technological complexity. Very recently, an innovative breathing&#8208;caloric mechanism in the MIL&#8208;53(Al) compound is reported, which implies gas adsorption under CO2 pressurization boosted by structural transitions and which overcomes the limitations of stand&#8208;alone CO2. Here, the breathing&#8208;caloric&#8208;like effects of MOF&#8208;508b are reported, surpassing by 40% those of MIL&#8208;53(Al). Moreover, the first thermometry device operating at room temperature and under the application of only 26&#160;bar of CO2 is presented. Under those conditions, this material presents values of &#916;T &#8776; 30&#160;K, reaching heating temperatures of 56 &#176;C and cooling temperatures of &#8722;10 &#176;C, which are already useful for space heating, air&#8208;conditioning, food refrigeration, and freezing applications.

         <title>Configurational Disorder, Strong Anharmonicity, and Coupled Host Dynamics Lead to Superionic Transport in Li3YCl6 (LYC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host&#8208;mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce the superionic transition in Li3YCl6. Establishing statistical correlations between ion hops and activation of specific vibrational modes, this work demonstrates that anharmonic modes, crucial for diffusion, persist across the superionic transition unlike many other superionic conductors and strongly couple with the close&#8208;packed anion lattice to enable ionic hops.








Abstract
In superionic crystals, liquid&#8208;like ionic diffusivities often come hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity and soft vibrational dynamics. However, generalized relationships between ion transport and vibrational dynamics remain elusive due to the diversity of superionic materials and complex underlying mechanisms. Here, the links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close&#8208;packed lithium halide ion conductor Li3YCl6 (LYC) are examined using a suite of atomistic first&#8208;principles methods. It is shown that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host&#8208;mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone&#8208;boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the &#8216;phonon&#8208;liquid&#8208;electron crystal&#8217; concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone&#8208;boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close&#8208;packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. The results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft&#8208;yet&#8208;resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in 3D close&#8208;packed&#160;crystals.

         <title>Achieving Clearance of Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infection and Rapid Cutaneous Wound Regeneration Using an ROS&#8208;Balancing&#8208;Engineered Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent nanocatalytic membrane composed of electrospun PLGA scaffolds and 2D2&#8208;bioHJs is developed and synthesized for the remediation of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria&#8208;infested cutaneous regeneration via an ROS levering tactic: the intelligent nanocatalytic membrane exhibits a dual capability of sequential generating and scavenging ROS, achieving programmed antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects.








Abstract
Intractable infected microenvironments caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria stalls the normal course of wound healing. Sono&#8208;piezodynamic therapy (SPT) is harnessed to combat pathogenic bacteria, but the superabundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during SPT inevitably provoke severe inflammatory response, hindering tissue regeneration. Consequently, an intelligent nanocatalytic membrane composed of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) and black phosphorus /V2C MXene bio&#8208;heterojunctions (2D2&#8208;bioHJs) is devised. Under ultrasonication, 2D2&#8208;bioHJs effectively eliminate drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by disrupting metabolism and electron transport chain (ETC). When ultrasonication ceases, they enable the elimination of SPT&#8208;generated ROS. The 2D2&#8208;bioHJs act as a &#8220;lever&#8221; that effectively achieves a balance between ROS generation and annihilation, delivering both antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties to the engineered membrane. More importantly, in vivo assays corroborate that the nanocatalytic membranes transform the stalled chronic wound environment into a regenerative one by eradicating the bacterial population, dampening the NF&#8208;&#954;B inflammatory pathway and promoting angiogenesis. As envisaged, this work demonstrates a novel tactic to arm membranes with programmed antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects to remedy refractory infected wounds from drug&#8208;fast bacteria.

         <title>Oriented Molecular Bridge Constructs Homogeneous Buried Interface for Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25.3%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented molecular bridge is proposed to construct homogeneous buried interface and enhance interfacial carrier transport. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an active area of 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 obtain PCEs of 25.32% (certified PCE: 25.32%) and 24.20%, respectively. In addition, the PSCs with oriented molecular bridge also exhibit excellent stability.








Abstract
Buried interface optimization matters the efficiency improvement of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the molecular bridge is reported to be an effective approach. Herein, a molecular bridge is constructed at buried interface using 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;sulfamoylbenzoic acid (CSBA), and its preferred arrangement is systematically investigated. It is elucidated that the CSBA molecular is prone to be orientationally absorbed on TiO2 surface through COOH&#8211;Ti, and then connect with perovskite through S&#9552;O&#8211;Pb, resulting in a feasible oriented molecular bridge. Contributing to the passivated interfacial defects, optimized interfacial energy level, and released perovskite tensile stress, resulting from the oriented CSBA molecular bridge, the PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm2 achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.32%, the highest among the TiO2&#8208;based planar PSCs. Encouragingly, the PSCs with an active area of 1 cm2 achieve a champion PCE of 24.20%, significantly promoting the efficiency progress of large&#8208;area PSCs. In addition, the PSCs with oriented CSBA molecular bridge possess enhanced stability, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain &#8776;91% and &#8776;85% of their initial PCE after 3000 h aging under ambient condition and 1200 h aging under exposure to UV irradiation.

     alt="Oriented Molecular Bridge Constructs Homogeneous Buried Interface for Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25.3%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oriented molecular bridge is proposed to construct homogeneous buried interface and enhance interfacial carrier transport. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an active area of 0.08 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; obtain PCEs of 25.32% (certified PCE: 25.32%) and 24.20%, respectively. In addition, the PSCs with oriented molecular bridge also exhibit excellent stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried interface optimization matters the efficiency improvement of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the molecular bridge is reported to be an effective approach. Herein, a molecular bridge is constructed at buried interface using 4-chloro-3-sulfamoylbenzoic acid (CSBA), and its preferred arrangement is systematically investigated. It is elucidated that the CSBA molecular is prone to be orientationally absorbed on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface through COOH&#8211;Ti, and then connect with perovskite through S&#9552;O&#8211;Pb, resulting in a feasible oriented molecular bridge. Contributing to the passivated interfacial defects, optimized interfacial energy level, and released perovskite tensile stress, resulting from the oriented CSBA molecular bridge, the PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.32%, the highest among the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based planar PSCs. Encouragingly, the PSCs with an active area of 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieve a champion PCE of 24.20%, significantly promoting the efficiency progress of large-area PSCs. In addition, the PSCs with oriented CSBA molecular bridge possess enhanced stability, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain &#8776;91% and &#8776;85% of their initial PCE after 3000 h aging under ambient condition and 1200 h aging under exposure to UV irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Mixed Biphasic Liquid Metal Composite with Ultra&#8208;High Stretchability and Strain&#8208;Insensitivity for Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic liquid metal particle (BMP) with two uniformly mixed particles is realized with the Marangoni mixing during the evaporation of co&#8208;solvents. The mixed morphology enables high conductivity and strain&#8208;insensitivity of the film. With BMP as stretchable interconnects, a stretchable multilayer neuromorphic circuit that can distinguish different signals with spike&#8208;based neuromorphic signal processing is demonstrated.








Abstract
Neuromorphic circuits that can function under extreme deformations are important for various data&#8208;driven wearable and robotic applications. Herein, biphasic liquid metal particle (BMP) with unprecedented stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitivity (&#916;R/R0 = 1.4@ 1200% strain) is developed to realize a stretchable neuromorphic circuit that mimics a spike&#8208;based biologic sensory system. The BMP consists of liquid metal particles (LMPs) and rigid liquid metal particles (RLMPs), which are homogeneously mixed via spontaneous solutal&#8208;Marangoni mixing flow during coating. This permits facile single step patterning directly on various substrates at room temperature. BMP is highly conductive (2.3 &#215; 106 S/m) without any post activation steps. BMP interconnects are utilized for a sensory system, which is capable of distinguishing variations of biaxial strains with a spiking neural network, thus demonstrating their potential for various sensing and signal processing applications.

         <title>Graphene Electrode for Studying CO2 Electroreduction Nanocatalysts under Realistic Conditions in Microcells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first integration of tri&#8208;layer graphene as a working electrode in liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy microcells shows advantages such as a wider inert window range for CO2 electroreduction than glassy carbon and a significant improvement in spatial resolution for electron imaging. Its application to the stability of Cu nanocubes allows operando studies at realistic potential ranges for extended reaction times.








Abstract
The ability to resolve the dynamic evolution of electrocatalytically induced processes with electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (EM)&#160;is limited by the microcell configuration. Herein, a free&#8208;standing tri&#8208;layer graphene is integrated as a membrane and electrode material into the electrochemical chip and its suitability as a substrate electrode at the high cathodic potentials required for CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) is evaluated. The three&#8208;layer stacked graphene is transferred onto an in&#8208;house fabricated single&#8208;working electrode chip for use with bulk&#8208;like reference and counter electrodes to facilitate evaluation of its effectiveness. Electrochemical measurements show that the graphene working electrode exhibits a wider inert cathodic potential range than the conventional glassy carbon electrode while achieving good charge transfer properties for nanocatalytic redox reactions. Operando scanning electron microscopy studies clearly demonstrate the improvement in spatial resolution but reveal a synergistic effect of the electron beam and the applied potential that limits the stability time window of the graphene&#8208;based electrochemical chip. By optimizing the operating conditions, in situ monitoring of Cu nanocube degradation is achieved at the CO2ER potential of &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE. Thus, this improved microcell configuration allows EM observation of catalytic processes at potentials relevant to real systems.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Engineered Heterointerface Catalysis for the Construction of Plant&#8208;Wearable Sensors</title>

Dual&#8208;shelled upconversion&#8208;nanoparticles@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;framework@polydopamine (UCNPs@ZIF@PDA) architecture with well&#8208;defined heterointerface is obtained via coordination&#8211;dissociation&#8211;polymerization mechanism. UCNPs@ZIF@PDA&#8208;based plant&#8208;wearble sensor can establish an adhesive and conformal interface on hairy plants, achieving on&#8208;site monitoring of 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid dynamic degradation in a noninvasive manner.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;wearable sensors provide real&#8208;time information that enables pesticide inputs to be finely tuned and play critical roles in precision agriculture. However, tracking pesticide information in living plants remains a formidable challenge owing to inadequate shape adaptabilities and low in&#8208;field sensor sensitivities. In this study, plant&#8208;wearable hydrogel discs are designed by embedding a dual&#8208;shelled upconversion&#8208;nanoparticles@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;framework@polydopamine (UCNPs@ZIF@PDA) composite in double&#8208;network hydrogels to deliver on&#8208;site pesticide&#8208;residue information. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalytic activity of ZIFs and enzyme triggered&#8208;responsive property of PDA shell, the hydrogel discs are endowed with high sensing sensitivity toward 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid pesticide at the nanogram per milliliter level via boosting fluorescence quenching efficiency. Notably, hydrogel discs mounted on tomato plants exhibit sufficient adaptability to profile dynamic pesticide degradation when used in conjunction with an ImageJ processing algorithm, which is practically applicable. Such hydrogel discs form a noninvasive and low&#8208;cost toolkit for the on&#8208;site acquisition of pesticide information, thereby contributing to the precise management of the health status of a plant and the judicious development of precision agriculture.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Synthetic Rotary Motors in Lipid Membranes Induce Shape Changes Through Membrane Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explore the nuanced relationship between light&#8208;driven molecular motors and lipid membranes in this research. Delve into the continuous interplay, observing how these motors, akin to dynamic springs fueled by light, orchestrate subtle yet fascinating shape transitions in membranes. Observe how these out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems can modulate area expansion through their action in lipid membranes.








Abstract
Membranes are the key structures to separate and spatially organize cellular systems. Their rich dynamics and transformations during the cell cycle are orchestrated by specific membrane&#8208;targeted molecular machineries, many of which operate through energy dissipation. Likewise, man&#8208;made light&#8208;activated molecular rotary motors have previously shown drastic effects on cellular systems, but their physical roles on and within lipid membranes remain largely unexplored. Here, the impact of rotary motors on well&#8208;defined biological membranes is systematically investigated. Notably, dramatic mechanical transformations are observed in these systems upon motor irradiation, indicative of motor&#8208;induced membrane expansion. The influence of several factors on this phenomenon is systematically explored, such as motor concentration and membrane composition., Membrane fluidity is found to play a crucial role in motor&#8208;induced deformations, while only minor contributions from local heating and singlet oxygen generation are observed. Most remarkably, the membrane area expansion under the influence of the motors continues as long as irradiation is maintained, and the system stays out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. Overall, this research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of molecular motors interacting with biological membranes, elucidating the multifaceted factors that govern membrane responses and shape transitions in the presence of these remarkable molecular machines, thereby supporting their future applications in chemical&#160;biology.

         <title>Deshielding Anions Enable Solvation Chemistry Control of LiPF6&#8208;Based Electrolyte toward Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dilemma of solvation chemistry control for Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes is tackled by introducing deshielding anions. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NO3&#8722; is chosen. Graphite anodes exhibit enhanced capacity retention of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C than the counterpart electrolyte (32.3%). This strategybypasses the solubility limitation of commonly used LiPF6 and enable its application under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Severe capacity decay under subzero temperatures remains a significant challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the sluggish interfacial kinetics. Current efforts to mitigate this deteriorating interfacial behavior rely on high&#8208;solubility lithium salts (e.g., Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI))&#8208;based electrolytes to construct anion participated solvation structures. However, such electrolytes bring issues of corrosion on the current collector and increased costs. Herein, the most commonly used Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) instead, to establish a peculiar solvation structure with a high ratio of ion pairs and aggregates by introducing a deshielding NO3&#8722; additive for low&#8208;temperature LIBs is utilized. The deshielding anion significantly reduces the energy barrier for interfacial behavior at low temperatures. Benefiting from this, the graphite (Gr) anode retains a high capacity of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which is far superior to the 32.3% and 19.4% capacity retention of counterpart electrolytes. Moreover, the LiCoO2/Gr full cell exhibits a stable cycling performance of 100 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C due to the inhibited lithium plating. This work heralds a new paradigm in LiPF6&#8208;based electrolyte design for LIBs operating at subzero temperatures.

         <title>Vicious Cycle&#8208;Breaking Lipid Nanoparticles Remodeling Multicellular Crosstalk to Reverse Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript prompts a vicious cycle breaking therapy to terminate the endless malignant interplay among various pathological hepatic cells in liver fibrosis. Far beyond single cell&#8208;centric approaches, the precise regulation of cellular crosstalk of &#8220;hepatic stellate cells&#8208;liver sinusoidal endothelial cells&#8208;hepatocytes&#8221; shows synergetic effect in two animal models and reverses the vicious cycle back to the virtuous loop.








Abstract
During liver fibrogenesis, the reciprocal crosstalk among capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and dysfunctional hepatocytes constructs a self&#8208;amplifying vicious cycle, greatly exacerbating the disease condition and weakening therapeutic effect. Limited by the malignant cellular interactions, the previous single&#8208;cell centric treatment approaches show unsatisfactory efficacy and fail to meet clinical demand. Herein, a vicious cycle&#8208;breaking strategy is proposed to target and repair pathological cells separately to terminate the malignant progression of liver fibrosis. Chondroitin sulfate&#8208;modified and vismodegib&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (CS&#8208;NPs/VDG) are designed to efficiently normalize the fenestrae phenotype of LSECs and restore HSCs to quiescent state by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling pathway. In addition, glycyrrhetinic acid&#8208;modified and silybin&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (GA&#8208;NPs/SIB) are prepared to restore hepatocytes function by relieving oxidative stress. The results show successful interruption of vicious cycle as well as distinct fibrosis resolution in two animal models through multiregulation of the pathological cells. This work not only highlights the significance of modulating cellular crosstalk but also provides a promising avenue for developing antifibrotic regimens.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Tandem Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on an effective interfacial doping between conjugated acceptor and metal oxide, the strobing&#8208;induced fatigue within bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/interconnecting layer (ICL) interface is overcome, thus the stability of tandem devices is enhanced and a champion PCE of 35.02% is succeeded.








Abstract
The ability of achieving high efficiency makes tandem organic photovoltaics (PVs) a competitive technique in potential indoor applications. Except high efficiency, reliable indoor energy supply also calls for outstanding stability. However, unavoidable unstable voltage supply from the circuit control system for indoor light sources like light emitting diodes (LED) and incandescent lamps would cause carrier density fluctuation and device fatigue driven by periodic light/dark switching. In this work, the strobing&#8208;induced fatigue within the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/interconnecting layer (ICL) interface is first revealed and overcome. Based on reliable and effective interfacial doping between conjugated acceptor and metal oxide, the interfacial capacitance that determines the strobing&#8208;induced fatigue, has been significantly restrained. The imbalance carrier migration and fierce inter&#8208;layer accommodating during the burn&#8208;in stage caused by light strobing are substantially diminished. Benefit from this method, the stability of tandem devices is highly enhanced under strobing indoor illumination, and a champion efficiency (35.02%) is obtained. The method provides guidance for further material design for interconnecting layers in organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Triggered Gelation of Supramolecular Peptide Nanocoils with Glucose&#8208;Binding Motifs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligopeptides with prosthetic glucose&#8208;binding motifs are shown to self&#8208;assemble into an uncommon nanocoil morphology and further entangle to form hydrogels upon glucose binding, with application for glucose&#8208;responsive therapeutic delivery of glucagon.








Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to prepare functional materials at the nanoscale. Often, the resulting materials have high aspect&#8208;ratio, with intermolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet formation underlying 1D fibrillar structures. Inspired by dynamic structures in nature, peptide self&#8208;assembly is increasingly moving toward stimuli&#8208;responsive designs wherein assembled structures are formed, altered, or dissipated in response to a specific cue. Here, a peptide bearing a prosthetic glucose&#8208;binding phenylboronic acid (PBA) is demonstrated to self&#8208;assemble into an uncommon nanocoil morphology. These nanocoils arise from antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, with molecules aligned parallel to the long axis of the coil. The binding of glucose to the PBA motif stabilizes and elongates the nanocoil, driving entanglement and gelation at physiological glucose levels. The glucose&#8208;dependent gelation of these materials is then explored for the encapsulation and release of a therapeutic agent, glucagon, that corrects low blood glucose levels. Accordingly, the release of glucagon from the nanocoil hydrogels is inversely related to glucose level. When evaluated in a mouse model of severe acute hypoglycemia, glucagon delivered from glucose&#8208;stabilized nanocoil hydrogels demonstrates increased protection compared to delivery of the agent alone or within a control nanocoil hydrogel that is not stabilized by glucose.

         <title>Regulation of Coordination Chemistry for Ultrastable Layered Oxide Cathode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable O3&#8208;Na0.898K0.058Ni0.396Fe0.098Mn0.396Ti0.092O2 is reported with rigid KO6 pillars and flexible TiO6 octahedra via multisite substitution to regulate its coordination chemistry. The enhanced hybridization of Ni(3deg*)&#8208;O(2p) and strong Coulombic repulsion between the interlayers effectively mitigate the undesired O3&#8211;O'3 phase transition and Ni/Fe migration for ultrastable electrochemical performance.

Layered transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxide cathodes have attracted growing attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical implementation is plagued by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and irreversible cation migration, leading to severe voltage decay and structure instability. Herein, O3&#8208;Na0.898K0.058Ni0.396Fe0.098Mn0.396Ti0.092O2 (KT&#8208;NFM) is reported as an ultrastable cathode material via multisite substitution with rigid KO6 pillars and flexible TiO6 octahedra. The K pillars induce contracted TMO2 slabs and their strong Coulombic repulsion to inhibit Ni/Fe migration; and Ti incorporation reinforces the hybridization of Ni(3deg*)&#8208;O(2p) to mitigate the undesired O3&#8211;O'3 phase transition. These enable the reversible redox of Ni2+&#8596;Ni3.20+ and Fe3+&#8596;Fe3.69+ for 138.6 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycles with &gt;90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles in a pouch cell of KT&#8208;NFM||hard carbon. This will provide insights into the design of ultrastable layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

         <title>Highly Efficient Monolithic Perovskite/Perovskite/Silicon Triple&#8208;Junction Solar Cells</title>

An ion&#8208;alloying strategy is reported to inhibit phase segregation in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites by doping RbCl. Based on this strategy, a high steady&#8208;state power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.48% from perovskite/perovskite/c&#8208;Si triple&#8208;junction tandem is achieved, a giant leap from the previous PCE record and the highest certified efficiency among all types of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites have demonstrated promise in multijunction photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, photoinduced phase segregation and the resultant low open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) have greatly limited the PV performance of perovskite&#8208;based multijunction devices. Here, a alloying strategy is reported to achieve uniform distribution of triple cations and halides in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites by doping Rb+ and Cl&#8722; with small ionic radii, which effectively suppresses halide phase segregation while promoting the homogenization of surface potential. Based on this strategy, a Voc of 1.33&#160;V is obtained from single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells, and a VOC approaching 3.0&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% (obtained from reverse scan direction, certified efficiency: 24.19%) on an 1.04 cm2 photoactive area can be achieved in a perovskite/perovskite/c&#8208;Si triple&#8208;junction tandem cell, where the certification efficiency is by far the greatest performance of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem solar cells. This work overcomes the performance deadlock of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem cells by setting a materials&#8208;by&#8208;design paradigm.

         <title>Biomimetic Self&#8208;Maturation Mineralization System for Enamel Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural enamel maturation process, a bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;maturation mineralization system consisting of ribonucleic acid&#8208;stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (RNA&#8208;ACP) and oral&#8208;derived ribonuclease (RNase) is developed, which repairs both the structure and properties of enamel. In the biomimetic self&#8208;maturation process, the structural rearrangement of RNA&#8208;ACP initiated by RNase promotes the early exclusion of organic additives, resulting in dense crystals without organic occlusion.








Abstract
Enamel repair is crucial for restoring tooth function and halting dental caries. However, contemporary research often overlooks the retention of organic residues within the repair layer, which hinders the growth of dense crystals and compromises the properties of the repaired enamel. During the maturation of natural enamel, the organic matrix undergoes enzymatic processing to facilitate further crystal growth, resulting in a highly mineralized tissue. Inspired by this process, a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation mineralization system is developed, comprising ribonucleic acid&#8208;stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (RNA&#8208;ACP) and ribonuclease (RNase). The RNA&#8208;ACP induces initial mineralization in the form of epitaxial crystal growth, while the RNase present in saliva automatically triggers a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation process. The mechanistic study further indicates that RNA degradation prompts conformational rearrangement of the RNA&#8208;ACP, effectively excluding the organic matter introduced earlier. This exclusion process promotes lateral crystal growth, resulting in the generation of denser enamel&#8208;like apatite crystals that are devoid of organic residues. This strategy of eliminating organic residues from enamel crystals enhances the mechanical and physiochemical properties of the repaired enamel. The present study introduces a conceptual biomimetic mineralization strategy for effective enamel repair in clinical practice and offers potential insights into the mechanisms of biomineral formation.

         <title>High&#8208;Surface Area Mesoporous Sc2O3 with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies as New and Advanced Electrocatalyst for Electrochemical Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New high&#8208;surface area Sc2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies (VO) is designed for high efficient electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid, a green and sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived terephthalic acidfor the establishment of a circular plastic economy.








Abstract
Scandium oxide (Sc2O3) is considered as omnipotent &#8220;Industrial Ajinomoto&#8221; and holds promise in catalytic applications. However, rarely little attention is paid to its electrochemistry. Here, the first nanocasting design of high&#8208;surface area Sc2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies (mesoporous VO&#8208;Sc2O3) for efficient electrochemical biomass valorization is reported. In the case of the electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), quantitative HMF conversion, high yield, and high faradic efficiency of FDCA via the hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid pathway are achieved by this advanced electrocatalyst. The beneficial effect of the VO on the electrocatalytic performance of the mesoporous VO&#8208;Sc2O3 is revealed by the enhanced adsorption of reactants and the reduced energy barrier in the electrochemical process. The concerted design, in situ and ex situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations shown in this work should shed light on the rational elaboration of advanced electrocatalysts, and contribute to the establishment of a circular carbon economy since the bio&#8208;plastic monomer and green hydrogen are efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Recyclable Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials with Superior Latent Heat via Reversible Anhydride&#8208;Alcohol Crosslinking for Efficient Thermal Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials with superior thermal energy storage capacity and dual recyclability are developed here by reacting anhydride copolymers with polyethylene glycol. Novel combined grafted and crosslinked crystalline structure promises a peak latent heat up to 156.8 J g&#8722;1; reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks enable outstanding recyclability. The potential of efficient solar energy conversion/storage/release has also been explored.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) with crosslinked polymer structures have received sustained interest due to their remarkable shape stability, enabling their application independently without the need for encapsulation or supporting materials. However, the crosslinking structure also compromises their latent heat and poses challenges to their recyclability. Herein, a novel strategy harnessing the internal&#8208;catalyzed reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinking reaction to fabricate SSPCMs with superior latent heat and exceptional dual recyclability is presented. Easily accessible anhydride copolymers (e.g., propylene&#8208;maleic anhydride alternating copolymers), provide abundant reactive anhydride sites within the polymer matrix; polyethylene glycol serves as both the grafted phase change component and the crosslinker. The resulting SSPCMs attain a peak latent heat value of 156.8 J g&#8722;1 which surpasses all other reported recyclable crosslinked SSPCMs. The materials also exhibit certain flexibility and a tunable tensile strength ranging from 6.6 to 11.0 MPa. Beyond that, leveraging the reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks, the SSPCMs demonstrate dual recyclability through bond&#8208;exchange remolding and reversible&#8208;dissociation&#8208;enabled dissolving&#8208;recrosslinking without any reactive chemicals. Furthermore, by integrating solar&#8208;thermal conversion fillers like polydopamine nanoparticles, the potential of the system in efficient conversion, storage, and release of solar energy is highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials with superior thermal energy storage capacity and dual recyclability are developed here by reacting anhydride copolymers with polyethylene glycol. Novel combined grafted and crosslinked crystalline structure promises a peak latent heat up to 156.8 J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; reversible anhydride-alcohol crosslinks enable outstanding recyclability. The potential of efficient solar energy conversion/storage/release has also been explored.

         <title>Crystallographic and Photophysical Analysis on Facet&#8208;Controlled Defect&#8208;Free Blue&#8208;Emitting Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure and spectroscopic properties of blue&#8208;emitting ZnSeTe quantum dots (QDs) are studied to elucidate the mechanism behind the facet&#8208;specific growth and enhanced emitting properties induced by hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment. Not only the role of HF treatment is unveiled, but also the interplay between the lattice structure, defect density, and photoluminescence properties of ZnSeTe QDs is thoroughly analyzed.








Abstract
The burgeoning demand for commercializing self&#8208;luminescing quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) has stimulated extensive research into environmentally friendly and efficient QD materials. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) additive improves photoluminescence (PL) properties of blue&#8208;emitting ZnSeTe QDs, ultimately reaching a remarkable quantum yield (QY) of 97% with an ultranarrow peak width of 14&#160;nm after sufficient HF addition. The improvement in optical properties of the QDs is accompanied by a morphology change of the particles, forming cubic&#8208;shaped defect&#8208;free ZnSeTe QDs characterized by a zinc blende (ZB) crystal structure. This treatment improves the QD&#8208;emitting properties by facilitating facet&#8208;specific growth, selectively exposing stabilized (100) facets, and reducing the lattice disorders. The facet&#8208;specific growth process gives rise to defect&#8208;free monodispersed cubic dots that exhibit remarkably narrow and homogeneous PL spectra. Meticulous time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies allow an understanding of the correlation between ZnSeTe QDs&#8217; particle shape and performance following HF addition. These investigations shed light on the intricacies of the growth mechanism and the factors influencing the PL efficiency of the resulting QDs. The findings significantly contribute to understanding the role of HF treatment in tailoring the optical properties of ZnSeTe QDs, thereby bringing it closer to the realization of highly efficient and bright QD&#8208;LEDs for various practical applications.

         <title>Bloch Point Quadrupole Constituting Hybrid Topological Strings Revealed with Electron Holographic Vector Field Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic monopoles are found to link skyrmions and antiskyrmions into hybrid 3D textures via vector field electron tomography. These hybrid strings have a 3D topology that is tunable via the application of an external field, changes in sample thickness, and DMI strength. This discovery paves the way for topologically tunable spintronics devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic (anti)skyrmions are robust string&#8208;like objects heralded as potential components in next&#8208;generation topological spintronics devices due to their low&#8208;energy manipulability via stimuli such as magnetic fields, heat, and electric/thermal current. While these 2D topological objects are widely studied, intrinsically 3D electron&#8208;spin real&#8208;space topology remains less explored despite its prevalence in bulky magnets. 2D&#8208;imaging studies reveal peculiar vortex&#8208;like contrast in the core regions of spin textures present in antiskyrmion&#8208;hosting thin plate magnets with S4 crystal symmetry, suggesting a more complex 3D real&#8208;space structure than the 2D model suggests. Here, holographic vector field electron tomography captures the 3D structure of antiskyrmions in a single&#8208;crystal, precision&#8208;doped (Fe0.63Ni0.3Pd0.07)3P (FNPP) lamellae at room temperature and zero field. These measurements reveal hybrid string&#8208;like solitons composed of skyrmions with topological number W = &#8722;1 on the lamellae's surfaces and an antiskyrmion (W = + 1) connecting them. High&#8208;resolution images uncover a Bloch point quadrupole (four magnetic (anti)monopoles that are undetectable in 2D imaging) which enables the observed lengthwise topological transitions. Numerical calculations corroborate the stability of hybrid strings over their conventional (anti)skyrmion counterparts. Hybrid strings result in topological tuning, a tunable topological Hall effect, and the suppression of skyrmion Hall motion, disrupting existing paradigms within spintronics.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Exhibiting Amplified Spontaneous Emission Waveguides with Standard Red Chromaticity of the Rec.2020 Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel organic crystals that display mechanical elasticity and flexible optical waveguides and amplified spontaneous emissions with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.71, 0.29), matching the red emission standard of the rec.2020 gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, are reported.








Abstract
The use of mechanically flexible molecular crystals as optical transuding media is demonstrated for a plethora of applications; however, the spectral peaks of optical outputs located mainly in the range of 400&#8211;600&#160;nm are insufficient for practical telecommunication and full&#8208;color display applications. Herein, two elastically bendable organic crystals are reported that show red emission of the rec.709 gamut under 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation yet generate rec.2020 gamut red optical waveguides and amplified spontaneous emissions when irradiated by a 355&#160;nm laser. Capitalizing on the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and donor&#8211;acceptor character, as well as mechanical elasticity, these organic crystals exhibit flexible optical waveguides with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.70, 0.29), nearly identical to the red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut required for ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) displays. Notably, one of the elastic crystals functions as a soft resonance cavity, resulting in amplified spontaneous emission waveguides with CIE coordinates of (0.71, 0.29) and the standard red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut, both in straight and bent states. This study presents a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;purity red&#8208;emissive crystalline materials to create all&#8208;organic, lightweight, and mechanically compliant optical telecommunication and UHD display devices.

         <title>Engineering Semi&#8208;Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Fuels Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel strategy of quantum&#8208;confinement&#8208;enhanced charge&#8208;separation is proposed and demonstrated in the well&#8208;designed model photocatalyst of CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed quantum&#8208;well. This kind of promising photocatalysts is capable of not only confining the photo&#8208;generated electrons nearby the hetero&#8208;interfacial active&#8208;sites, but also accelerating the electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion.








Abstract
Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge&#8208;utilization efficiency for light&#8208;emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, this work proposes a new idea to significantly improve the photo&#8208;generated charge separation for attaining a highly&#8208;efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi&#8208;reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo&#8208;generated electrons. This electron confinement&#8208;improved charge separation is implemented in the well&#8208;designed model of the CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra&#8208;thin edge regions) of the TiO2 nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo&#8208;generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO2&#8208;{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO2 hetero&#8208;interface. Thereby, the continuous multi&#8208;electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO2/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8776;35.7 and &#8776;56.0&#8208;fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO2 reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO2. Correspondingly, its CH4&#8208;product selectivity is increased by &#8776;180%.

     alt="Engineering Semi-Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly-Efficient Solar-to-Fuels Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel strategy of quantum-confinement-enhanced charge-separation is proposed and demonstrated in the well-designed model photocatalyst of CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS semi-reversed quantum-well. This kind of promising photocatalysts is capable of not only confining the photo-generated electrons nearby the hetero-interfacial active-sites, but also accelerating the electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active-sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity for solar-to-fuels conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge-utilization efficiency for light-emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, this work proposes a new idea to significantly improve the photo-generated charge separation for attaining a highly-efficient solar-to-fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi-reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo-generated electrons. This electron confinement-improved charge separation is implemented in the well-designed model of the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS semi-reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra-thin edge regions) of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo-generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hetero-interface. Thereby, the continuous multi-electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active-sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8776;35.7 and &#8776;56.0-fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Correspondingly, its CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-product selectivity is increased by &#8776;180%. This work provides a novel charge separation mechanism, which is of great importance for the design of the next-generation quantum-sized photocatalysts for solar-to-fuels conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formulating Local Environment of Oxygen Mitigates Voltage Hysteresis in Li&#8208;Rich Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work decouples the relationship between the local environment of oxygen in the structure and O redox behavior, elucidating that the fundamental reason for voltage hysteresis originates from the reactivity of oxygen ions at low voltage. The occupancy of TM ions at Li 2b sites regulated by composition design modifies the local environment of oxygen, thus effectively restraining voltage hysteresis.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have emerged as one of the most prospective options for Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their remarkable energy density (&gt;900&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). However, voltage hysteresis during charge and discharge process lowers the energy conversion efficiency, which hinders their application in practical devices. Herein, the fundamental reason for voltage hysteresis through investigating the O redox behavior under different (de)lithiation states is unveiled and it is successfully addressed by formulating the local environment of O2&#8722;. In Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based materials, it is confirmed that there exists reaction activity of oxygen ions at low discharge voltage (&lt;3.6&#160;V) in the presence of TM&#8208;TM&#8208;Li ordered arrangement, generating massive amount of voltage hysteresis and resulting in a decreased energy efficiency (80.95%). Moreover, in the case where Li 2b sites are numerously occupied by TM ions, the local environment of O2&#8722; evolves, the reactivity of oxygen ions at low voltage is significantly inhibited, thus giving rise to the large energy conversion efficiency (89.07%). This study reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship between the local environment around O2&#8722; and voltage hysteresis, which provides guidance in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Thermal Insulation and Impact Resistance in Transparent Bulk Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transparent bulk glass is utilized for light transmission and protection against external hazards, but it is hindered by poor protective properties. Through synergistic effects between nacre&#8208;inspired structures and shear&#8208;stiffening materials, the fabricated glass composite (NSG) demonstrates optimal impact resistance over a wide range of impact velocities. Moreover, NSG exhibits superior light transmittance, thermal insulation, and other comprehensive application properties.








Abstract
Transparent bulk glass is highly demanded in devices and components of daily life to transmit light and protect against external temperature and mechanical hazards. However, the application of glass is impeded by its poor functional performance, especially in terms of thermal isolation and impact resistance. Here, a glass composite integrating the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and shear stiffening gel (SSG) material is proposed. Benefiting from the combination of these two elements, this nacre&#8208;inspired SSG/glass composite (NSG) exhibits superior thermal insulation and impact resistance while maintaining transparency simultaneously. Specifically, the low thermal conductivity of the SSG combined with the anisotropic heat transfer capability of the nacre&#8208;inspired structure enhances the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal insulation of NSG. The deformations over large volumes in nacre&#8208;inspired facesheets promote the deformation region of the SSG core, synergistic effect of tablet sliding mechanism in nacre&#8208;inspired structure and strain&#8208;rate enhancement in SSG material cause the superior impact resistance of overall panels in a wide range of impact velocities. NSG demonstrates outstanding properties such as transparency, light weight, impact resistance, and thermal insulation, which are major concerns for the application in engineering fields. In conclusion, this bioinspired SSG/glass composite opens new avenues to achieve comprehensive performance improvements for transparent structural materials.

         <title>Mechanochemically Reprogrammed Interface Orchestrates Neutrophil Bactericidal Activity and Apoptosis for Preventing Implant&#8208;Associated Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated nanopillars and oxygen self&#8208;supporting nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. CPZTs prevent implant&#8208;associated infection by repelling bacterial adhesion, killing attached bacteria, and facilitating neutrophil bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, self&#8208;supporting oxygen allows neutrophils to orchestrate intracellular bactericidal activity and apoptosis under hypoxia, contributing to inflammation resolution.








Abstract
The onset of implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) triggers a cascade of immune responses, which are initially dominated by neutrophils. Bacterial aggregate formation and hypoxic microenvironment, which occur shortly after implantation, may be two major risk factors that impair neutrophil function and lead to IAI. Here, the implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated TiO2 nanopillar arrays (PA&#8211;Zn@TiNPs) and oxygen self&#8208;supporting CaO2 nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. The engineered CPZTs interface integrates multiple properties to inhibit the formation of nascent biofilm, encompassing antibacterial adhesion, mechanobactericidal effect, and chemobiocidal effect. Meanwhile, continuous oxygenation fuels the neutrophils with reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient bacterial elimination on the implant surface and inside the neutrophils. Furthermore, this surface modulation strategy accelerates neutrophil apoptosis and promotes M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated osteogenesis both in vitro and in a rat model of IAI. In conclusion, targeting neutrophils for immunomodulation is a practical and effective strategy to prevent IAI and promote bone&#8211;implant integration.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with Trap&#8208;Free Host Beats Power Efficiency and Lifetime of Multilayer Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes offer many benefits compared to multilayer devices. However, in such single&#8208;layer devices, balanced charge transport is a prerequisite, which is uncommon in organic emitters. Here, a trap&#8208;free host is employed to achieve balanced charge transport in the emissive layer, resulting in lower operating voltage, higher power efficiency, and greatly extended lifetime compared to multilayer devices.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing a single active layer potentially offer a number of benefits compared to multilayer devices; reduced number of materials and deposition steps, potential for solution processing, and reduced operating voltage due to the absence of heterojunctions. However, for single&#8208;layer OLEDs to achieve efficiencies approaching those of multilayer devices, balanced charge transport is a prerequisite. This requirement excludes many efficient emitters based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) that exhibit electron trapping, such as the green&#8208;emitting bis(4&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)phenyl)methanone (DMAC&#8208;BP). By employing a recently developed trap&#8208;free large band gap material as a host for DMAC&#8208;BP, nearly balanced charge transport is achieved. The single&#8208;layer OLED reaches an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 19.6%, which is comparable to the reported EQEs of 18.9&#8211;21% for multilayer devices, but achieves a record power efficiency for DMAC&#8208;BP OLEDs of 82&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, clearly surpassing the reported multilayer power efficiencies of 52.9&#8211;59&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the operational stability is greatly improved compared to multilayer devices and the use of conventional host materials in combination with DMAC&#8208;BP as an emitter. Next to the obvious reduction in production costs, single&#8208;layer OLEDs therefore also offer the advantage of reduced energy consumption and enhanced stability.

In addition, the operational stability is greatly improved compared to multilayer devices and the use of conventional host materials in combination with DMAC-BP as an emitter. Next to the obvious reduction in production costs, single-layer OLEDs therefore also offer the advantage of reduced energy consumption and enhanced stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MBene with Redox&#8208;Active Terminal Groups for an Energy&#8208;Dense Cascade Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional transition metal borides (MBene) with &#8208;Br redox&#8208;active functional groups is first synthesized using CuBr2 molten salt etchant. When used as the host of iodine species, the cascade reactions of I&#8208;/I0 and Br&#8208;/Br0 can be realized. Specifically, the iodine&#8208;coated Mo1.33Y0.52B2Br1.22 (I2@MBene&#8208;Br) delivers higher specific energy and specific power than those of conventional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBenes), new members of the 2D materials family, hold great promise for use in the electrocatalytic and energy storage fields because of their high specific area, high chemical activity, and fast charge carrier mobility. Although various types of MBenes are reported, layered MBenes featuring redox&#8208;active terminal groups for high energy output are not yet produced. A facile and energy&#8208;efficient method for synthesizing MBenes equipped with redox&#8208;active terminal groups for cascade Zn||I2 batteries is presented. Layered MBenes have ordered metal vacancies and &#9472;Br terminal groups, enabling the sequential reactions of I&#8722;/I0 and Br&#8722;/Br0. The I2&#8208;hosting MBene&#8208;Br cathode results in a specific energy as high as 485.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 899.7&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a specific power as high as 6007.7&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 180.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, far exceeding the best records for Zn||I2 batteries. The results of this study demonstrate that the challenges of MBene synthesis can be overcome and reveal an efficient path for producing high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active electrode materials for energy&#8208;dense cascade aqueous batteries.

         <title>Modifying Surface Termination by Bidentate Chelating Strategy Enables 13.77% Efficient Kesterite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new chelating strategy using sodium diethyldithiocarbamate to strongly coordinate with undercoordinated metal cations on the surface of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4&#160;(CZTSSe) films is demonstrated. The power conversion efficiency is significantly increased to 13.77%, making it one of the most efficient CZTSSe solar cells. This surface chelation strategy provides strong surface termination and defect passivation for further development and application of kesterite&#8208;type photovoltaic device.








Abstract
Surfaces display discontinuities in the kesterite&#8208;based polycrystalline films can produce large defect densities, including strained and dangling bonds. These physical defects tend to introduce electronic defects and surface states, which can greatly promote nonradiative recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs and damage device performance. Here, an effective chelation strategy is reported to suppress these harmful physical defects related to unterminated Cu, Zn, and Sn sites by modifying the surface of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (NaDDTC). The conjoint theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the NaDDTC molecules can be coordinate to surface metal sites of CZTSSe films via robust bidentate chelating interactions, effectively reducing surface undercoordinated defects and passivating the electron trap states. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency of the NaDDTC&#8208;treated device is increased to as high as 13.77% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination, with significant improvement in fill factor and open&#8208;circuit voltage. This surface chelation strategy provides strong surface termination and defect passivation for further development and application of kesterite&#8208;based photovoltaics.

         <title>Establishing Multiple&#8208;Order Built&#8208;In Electric Fields Within Heterojunctions to Achieve Photocarrier Spatial Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the multiple&#8208;order electric fields are designed and constructed with a larger range of action in ZnO/ZnS heterojunctions to promote the smooth transport of photogenerated holes from ZnS NPs to ZnO NDs, thereby elevating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoconversion to be 3811.7&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1, and offering a prototype for tuning the distribution of the built&#8208;in electric fields in heterojunctions.








Abstract
Hybridizing two heterocomponents to construct a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) at the interface represents a significant strategy for facilitating charge separation in carbon dioxide (CO2)&#8208;photoreduction. However, the unidirectional nature of BIEFs formed by various low&#8208;dimensional materials poses challenges in adequately segregating the photogenerated carriers produced in bulk. In this study, leveraging zinc oxide (ZnO) nanodisks, a sulfurization reaction is employed to fabricate Z&#8208;scheme ZnO/zinc sulfide (ZnS) heterojunctions featuring a multiple&#8208;order BIEF. These heterojunctions reveal distinctive interfacial structures characterized by two semicoherent phase boundaries. The cathodoluminescence 2D maps and density functional theory calculation results demonstrate that the direction of the multiple&#8208;order BIEF spans from ZnS to ZnO. This directional alignment significantly fosters the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes within ZnS nanoparticles and enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;carbon monoxide photoreduction performance (3811.7&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1). The findings present a novel pathway for structurally designing BIEFs within heterojunctions, while providing fresh insights into the migratory behavior of photogenerated carriers across interfaces.

         <title>Co&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Modified NiOx for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>

Phosphorylcholine chloride and Me&#8208;4PACz are used to form Co&#8208;SAM on the NiOx surface to optimize the buried interface in PSCs. Co&#8208;SAM can promote the growth of perovskite crystals, passivate buried defects, optimize the energy band alignment, and relieve the residual stress of the perovskite film, leading to power conversion efficiencies as high as 25.09% and excellent device stability.








Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) are an effective method to solve the problem of the buried interface of NiOx in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the Me&#8208;4PACz end group (carbazole core) cannot forcefully passivate defects at the bottom of the perovskite film. Here, a Co&#8208;SAM strategy is employed to modify the buried interface of PSCs. Me&#8208;4PACz is doped with phosphorylcholine chloride (PC) to form a Co&#8208;SAM to improve the monolayer coverage and reduce leakage current. The phosphate group and chloride ions (Cl&#8722;) in PC can inhibit NiOx surface defects. Meantime, the quaternary ammonium ions and Cl&#8722; in PC can fill organic cations and halogen vacancies in the perovskite film to enable defects passivation. Moreover, Co&#8208;SAM can promote the growth of perovskite crystals, collaboratively solve the problem of buried defects, suppress nonradiative recombination, accelerate carrier transmission, and relieve the residual stress of the perovskite film. Consequently, the Co&#8208;SAM modified devices show power conversion efficiencies as high as 25.09% as well as excellent device stability with 93% initial efficiency after 1000 h of operation under one&#8208;sun illumination. This work demonstrates the novel approach for enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs by modifying Co&#8208;SAM on NiOx.

The phosphate group and chloride ions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in PC can inhibit NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; surface defects. Meantime, the quaternary ammonium ions and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in PC can fill organic cations and halogen vacancies in the perovskite film to enable defects passivation. Moreover, Co-SAM can promote the growth of perovskite crystals, collaboratively solve the problem of buried defects, suppress nonradiative recombination, accelerate carrier transmission, and relieve the residual stress of the perovskite film. Consequently, the Co-SAM modified devices show power conversion efficiencies as high as 25.09% as well as excellent device stability with 93% initial efficiency after 1000 h of operation under one-sun illumination. This work demonstrates the novel approach for enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs by modifying Co-SAM on NiO&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Flexible Cages Enable Robust Supramolecular Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a pioneering flexible cage&#8208;reinforced supramolecular elastomer (CSE) is reported that exhibits superb robustness, tear resistance, anti&#8208;fatigue, and shape memory properties, achieved by innovatively introducing organic imide cages (OICs) into supramolecular networks. Intriguingly, extremely small amounts of OICs make the elastomer stronger, significantly improving mechanical strength (&#8776;10&#8208;fold increase) and toughness (&#8776;7&#8208;fold increase).








Abstract
Advances in modern industrial technology continue to place stricter demands on engineering polymeric materials, but simultaneously possessing superior strength and toughness remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a pioneering flexible cage&#8208;reinforced supramolecular elastomer (CSE) is reported that exhibits superb robustness, tear resistance, anti&#8208;fatigue, and shape memory properties, achieved by innovatively introducing organic imide cages (OICs) into supramolecular networks. Intriguingly, extremely small amounts of OICs make the elastomer stronger, significantly improving mechanical strength (85.0&#160;MPa; &#8776;10&#8208;fold increase) and toughness (418.4&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3; &#8776;7&#8208;fold increase). Significantly, the cooperative effect of gradient hydrogen bonds and OICs is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated as flexible nodes, enabling more robust supramolecular networks. In short, the proposed strengthening strategy of adding flexible cages effectively balances the inherent conflict between material strength and toughness, and the prepared CSEs are anticipated to be served in large&#8208;scale devices such as TBMs in the future.

         <title>A Tough Monolithic&#8208;Integrated Triboelectric Bioplastic Enabled&#160;by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the problem of mismatch at the dielectric&#8211;conductive layer interface in green electronics, this study utilizes dynamic covalent chemistry to synthesize a tough monolithic&#8208;integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The triboelectric bioplastic has tensile strength (87.4 MPa) and toughness (33.3 MJ m&#8722;3) and is noncracking after being subjected to a tensile force of 10&#160;000 times its own weight.








Abstract
Electronic waste is a growing threat to the global environment and human health, raising particular concerns. Triboelectric devices synthesized from sustainable and degradable materials are a promising electronic alternative, but the mechanical mismatch at the interface between the polymer substrate and the electrodes remains unresolved in practical applications. This study uses the sulfhydryl silanization reaction and the chemical selectivity and site specificity of the thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction in dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare a tough monolithic&#8208;integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The stress is dissipated by covalent bond adaptation to the interface interaction, which makes the polymer dielectric layer to the conductive layer have a good interface adhesion effect (220.55&#160;kPa). The interfacial interlocking of the polymer substrate with the conductive layer gives the triboelectric bioplastic excellent tensile strength (87.4&#160;MPa) and fracture toughness (33.3&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Even when subjected to a tension force of 10&#160;000 times its weight, it still maintains a stable triboelectric output with no visible cracks. This study provides new insights into the design of reliable and environmentally friendly self&#8208;powered devices, which is significant for the development of flexible wearable electronics.

         <title>Chaotropic Effect&#8208;Boosted Thermogalvanic Ionogel Thermocells for All&#8208;Weather Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermogalvanic ionogel composed of an ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium dicyanamide, and an ion redox couple, [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;, is prepared to achieve high thermogalvanic effects for all&#8208;weather, temperature self&#8208;supplying thermocell, through the combination of the passive radiative cooling regulation. The fabricated thermocell displays a high normalized temperature&#8208;relevant power density (Pmax/&#916;T2) and a giant Seebeck coefficient.








Abstract
Ionic thermocells convert heat into electricity and are promising power sources for electronic devices. However, discontinuous and small electricity output limits practical use under varying environmental conditions. Here, a thermogalvanic ionogel with a high Seebeck coefficient (32.4&#160;mV K&#8722;1) is designed. Thermocells that combine thermogalvanic ionogel&#8208;based thermocells, which realize all&#8208;weather power generation via passive radiative cooling, are also developed. These thermocells generate electricity continuously under varying weather conditions and over a wide temperature range (&#8722;40 to 90 &#176;C), with a normalized power density of 25.84&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2. Advanced characterization shows that the chaotropic effect enhances the Seebeck coefficient, while the self&#8208;supplying temperature difference given the radiative cooling structure enables all&#8208;weather power generation. These results provide an effective strategy for developing practical thermocells suitable for diverse daily and seasonal variations.

         <title>Pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene Stabilizes Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces for Sodium&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells of 145 Wh Kg&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (FPPN) simultaneously serves as a functional electrolyte additive to stabilize cathode electrolyte interphase and solid electrolyte interlayer. The fluorine atoms&#160;and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated &#9472;P&#63742;N&#9472; structure of FPPN can promote reduction and oxidation, respectively. 5 Ah sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with FPPN demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The energy density is as high as 145 Wh kg&#8208;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries are competitive candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage batteries due to the abundant sodium resource. However, the electrode interface in the conventional electrolyte is unstable, deteriorating the cycle life of the cells. Introducing functional electrolyte additives can generate stable electrode interfaces. Here, pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (FPPN) serves as a functional electrolyte additive to stabilize the interfaces of the layered oxide cathode and the hard carbon anode. The fluorine substituting groups and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated &#9472;P&#63742;N&#9472; structure decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and increase the highest occupied molecular orbital of FPPN, respectively, realizing the preferential reduction and oxidization of FPPN on the anode and cathode simultaneously, which results in the formation of a uniform, ultrathin, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interlayer and cathode electrolyte interphase. The sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells of 5 Ah capacity rather than coin cells are assembled to evaluate the effect of FPPN. It can retain a high capacity of 4.46 Ah after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a low decay ratio of 0.01% per cycle. The pouch cell also achieves a high energy density of 145&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a wide operating temperature of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C. This work can attract more attention to the rational electrolyte design for practical applications.

         <title>Controlling Film Formation and Host&#8208;Guest Interactions to Enhance the Thermoelectric Properties of Nickel&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general, dynamically controlled on&#8208;surface synthesis method and controlling host&#8208;guest interactions, record electrical conductivity (100 &#8211; 200 S cm&#8211;1) and high thermoelectric power factors up to 10 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are demonstrated in nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;based 2D conductive coordination polymers and their charge transport physics are elucidated.








Abstract
2D conjugated coordination polymers (cCPs) based on square&#8208;planar transition metal&#8208;complexes (such as MO4, M(NH)4, and MS4, M = metal) are an emerging class of (semi)conducting materials that are of great interest for applications in supercapacitors, catalysis, and thermoelectrics. Finding synthetic approaches to high&#8208;performance nickel&#8208;nitrogen (Ni&#8208;N) based cCP films is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a general, dynamically controlled on&#8208;surface synthesis that produces highly conductive Ni&#8208;N&#8208;based cCP films is developed and the thermoelectric properties as a function of the molecular structure and their dependence on interactions with ambient atmosphere are studied. Among the four studied cCPs with different ligand sizes hexaminobenzene&#8208; and hexaaminotriphenylene&#8208;based films exhibit record electrical conductivity (100&#8211;200 S cm&#8211;1) in this Ni&#8208;N based cCP family, which is one order of magnitude higher than previous reports, and the highest thermoelectric power factors up to 10 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 among reported 2D cCPs. The transport physics of these films is studied and it is shown that depending on the host&#8208;guest interaction with oxygen/water the majority carrier type and the value of the Seebeck coefficient can be largely regulated. The high conductivity is likely reflecting good interconnectivity between (small) ordered domains and grain boundaries supporting disordered metallic transport.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence Enabled by Dichroism Modulation in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) material with the sign inversion character is constructed by incorporating photosensitive negative dichroic dye and an appropriate ratio of the opposite dichroic achiral dye into the cholesteric liquid crystals. The CPL signals invert without helical superstructure change. These results provide valuable avenues for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL tools for information security and anticounterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials show great promise in applying information encryption and anticounterfeiting. Herein, light&#8208;driven CPL sign inversion is achieved by combining a photoresponsive achiral negative dichroic dye (KG) and a static achiral positive dichroic dye (NR) as dopants at the 0.5:0.5 weight ratio into the cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) host. The side chains of KG undergo trans/cis isomerization after 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation, leading to the dichroism (SF) decrease. The |glum| value of CLC doping with KG (CLC&#8208;KG) weakens from 0.67 to 0.28 in response to the order degree change. Taking advantage of its unique CPL response property, the light&#8208;driven CPL sign inversion is achieved (from &#8722;0.20/0.14 to 0.02/&#8722;0.04) by incorporating NR (0.5:0.5) into the CLC&#8208;KG with helical superstructure static. Based on the synergistic use of circular polarization and responsiveness state as cryptographic primitives, the multidimensional information encryption CLC system can be realized.

         <title>220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz Compatible Bipolar Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright bipolar quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with the external quantum efficiency exceeding 22% are developed by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al/Ag bridging layer. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting device can be driven directly by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics.








Abstract
Alternating current (AC)&#8208;driven quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are superior to direct current&#8208;driven QLEDs because they can be directly integrated into household AC electricity and have high stability. However, achieving high&#8208;performance AC&#8208;driven QLEDs remains challenging. In this work, a bipolar QLED with coplanar electrodes is realized by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al bridging layer. The bipolar QLED can be turned on with either a positive or a negative bias voltage, with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.9%. By replacing the Al with Ag, the resistances of the electron transport layers are effectively reduced, and thus the bipolar QLED shows an enhanced brightness of 16370&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 15&#160;V. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting light source can be directly driven by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics. The bipolar QLED can also be realized by vertically stacking a regular QLED and an inverted QLED with a metallic intermediate connection layer. It is demonstrated that the coplanar or vertical bipolar QLEDs could find potential applications in household AC electricity play&#8208;and&#8208;plug solid&#8208;state lighting and single&#8208; or double&#8208;sided displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Narrow Dual&#8208;Band Circular Polarized Light Detection for Encrypted Communications and Color Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is described to achieve a high&#8208;performance narrow dual&#8208;band circular polarized photodetector via combining light&#8208;driven cholesteric liquid crystal films with a photodiode&#8208;type photodetector. A super&#8208;high dissymmetry factor of 1.62, left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light detectivity of 6.16 &#215; 1014 Jones, and narrow dual&#8208;band circularly polarized light detection, changing from 535 to 725&#160;nm, with a half&#8208;maximum full width of less than 90&#160;nm is realized.








Abstract
Conventional circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors necessitate several optical elements, posing difficulties in achieving miniature and integrated devices. Recently developed organic CPL detectors require no additional optical elements but usually suffer from low detectivity or low asymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). Here, an organic CPL detector with excellent detectivity and a high g&#8208;factor is fabricated. By employing an inverted quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (IPHJ) structure and incorporating an additional liquid crystal film, a CPL detector with an outstanding g&#8208;factor of 1.62 is developed. Unfavorable charge injection is effectively suppressed by the IPHJ structure, which reduces the dark current of the organic photodetector. Consequently, a left CPL detectivity of 6.16 &#215; 1014 Jones at 640&#160;nm is realized, surpassing all of the latest photodiode&#8208;type CPL detectors. Adopting a liquid crystal film with adjustable wavelengths of selectively reflected light, the hybrid device achieves narrow dual&#8208;band CPL detection, varying from 530 to 640&#160;nm, with a half&#8208;maximum full width below 90&#160;nm. Notably, the device achieves excellent stability of 260 000 on/off cycles without attenuation. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, all these features have rarely been reported in previous work. The CPL detector arrays are also demonstrated for encrypted communications and color imaging.

         <title>Facilitating Interskin Communication in Artificial Polymer Systems through Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial liquid crystal polymer skins are employed to construct an intelligent chemical communication system, enabling the releasing, transferring, and sensing of chemical signals. Once receiving the chemical messages, the polymer skin as a receiver displays both transmittance and electric signal change. By infusing the sender and the receiver with different reagents, a reaction takes place to generate desired species.








Abstract
Chemical communication is a ubiquitous process in nature, and it has sparked interest in the development of electric&#8208;sense&#8208;based robotic perception systems with chemical components. Here, a novel liquid crystal polymer is introduced that combines the transferring, receiving, and sensing of chemical signals, providing a new principle to achieve chemical communication in robotic systems. This approach allows for the transfer of cargo between two polymer coatings, and the transfer can be monitored through an electrical signal. Additionally, cascade transfer can be achieved through this approach, as the transfer of cargo is not limited to only two coatings, but can continue from the second to a third coating. Furthermore, the two coatings can be infused with different reagents, and upon exchange, a reaction takes place to generate the desired species. The novel method of chemical communication that is developed presents a notable improvement in embodied perception. This advancement facilitates human&#8211;robot and robot&#8211;robot interactions and enhances the ability of robots to efficiently and accurately perform complex tasks in their environment.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Activated Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Transparent and Flexible Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow polymer films are fabricated using a facile molecular doping strategy. They emit an afterglow that lasts longer than 11&#160;h at room temperature in air and can be activated by sunlight. The color of the afterglow polymers can be tuned from cyan to red. Efficient information display and storage applications of these materials have been demonstrated.








Abstract
Afterglow materials featuring long emission durations ranging from milliseconds to hours have garnered increasing interest owing to their potential applications in sensing, bioimaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Unfortunately, polymeric materials rarely exhibit afterglow properties under ambient conditions because of the rapid nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons. In this study, hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymer films are fabricated using a facile molecular doping strategy. Flexible and transparent polymer films emitted a bright afterglow lasting over 11&#160;h at room temperature in air, which is one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials reported to date. Intriguingly, HLA polymer films can be activated by sunlight, and their cyan afterglow in air can be readily observed by the naked eye. Moreover, the HLA color of the polymer films could be tuned from cyan to red through the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer mechanism. Their application in flexible displays and information storage has also been demonstrated. With remarkable advantages, including an hour&#8208;long and bright afterglow, tunable afterglow colors, superior flexibility and transparency, and ease of fabrication, the HLA polymer paves the way for the practical application of afterglow materials in the engineering sector.

         <title>High Performance and Reprocessable In Situ Generated Nanofiber Reinforced Composites Based on Liquid Crystal Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of NDA with kinked structure into liquid crystal polyarylate promotes the formation of in situ generated NFRC which possesses superior reprocessability and unprecedent thermomechanical properties. And the NFRC based TENG exhibits superior electrical output performance retention rate (&gt; 90%) after being reprocessed and adapts to diverse working modes.








Abstract
Polymers are playing important roles in the rapid development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs); However, most polymers cannot meet the high requirements of thermomechanical performance; Thus, various polymeric composites are developed for triboelectric layer. These composites are hardly recycled since their reinforcements are unevenly distributed after reprocessing, which limits the sustainable development of TENGs. To solve the above challenges, in situ generated nanofiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) based on single&#8208;component liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP) are designed and prepared via a one&#8208;step polycondensation. Nonlinear naphthalene (NDA) widens the processing window of LCP without destabilizing the liquid crystal phase. The NDA&#8208;rich domains act as a matrix while the NDA&#8208;poor domains with higher rigidity form oriented nanofibers to achieve self&#8208;reinforcement. The resultant NFRCs possess high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt; 220 &#176;C) and storage modulus (E&#8242; = 0.1&#160;GPa at 350 &#176;C), which are far beyond existing triboelectric polymers, typically Tg &lt; 110 &#176;C and E&#8242; &lt; 0.1&#160;MPa (flowable) at 350 &#176;C. Furthermore, NFRC&#8208;based TENG exhibits superior electrical output performance and retention rate (&gt;90%) after reprocessing; Overall, this work offers a new design principle to prepare self&#8208;reinforced composites, which paves a way to explore high performance materials.

         <title>Injectable Microgels with Hybrid Exosomes of Chondrocyte&#8208;Targeted FGF18 Gene&#8208;Editing and Self&#8208;Renewable Lubrication for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel injectable microgel system (CAP/++FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs) is developed by employing chondrocyte&#8208;specific targeting hybrid exosomes loaded with a CRISPR&#8208;based FGF18&#8208;targeting gene&#8208;editing tool, encapsulated in methacrylic anhydride&#8208;modified hyaluronic hydrogel microspheres via microfluidics and photopolymerization to provide a cell&#8208;free Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment that combines the dual effects of chondrocyte&#8208;targeted in vivo gene activation of FGF18 and persistent lubrication in response to frictional wear.








Abstract
Abnormal silencing of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling significantly contributes to joint dysplasia and osteoarthritis (OA); However, the clinical translation of FGF18&#8208;based protein drugs is hindered by their short half&#8208;life, low delivery efficiency and the need for repeated articular injections. This study proposes a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based approach to effectively activate the FGF18 gene of OA chondrocytes at the genome level in vivo, using chondrocyte&#8208;affinity peptide (CAP) incorporated hybrid exosomes (CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO) loaded with an FGF18&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;editing tool. Furthermore, CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO are encapsulated in methacrylic anhydride&#8208;modified hyaluronic (HAMA) hydrogel microspheres via microfluidics and photopolymerization to create an injectable microgel system (CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs) with self&#8208;renewable hydration layers to provide persistent lubrication in response to frictional wear. Together, the injectable CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs, combined with in vivo FGF18 gene editing and continuous lubrication, have demonstrated their capacity to synergistically promote cartilage regeneration, decrease inflammation, and prevent ECM degradation both in vitro and in vivo, holding great potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Integrating Light Diffusion and Conversion Layers for Highly Efficient Multicolored Fiber&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell integrated with light diffusion and conversion layers efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for more light harvesting, producing a record power conversion efficiency of 13.11%. It can be also made with color&#8208;tunable appearance and further integrated with fiber battery as next&#8208;generation power system.








Abstract
Fiber solar cells as promising wearable power supplies have attracted increasing attentions recently, while further breakthrough on their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and realization of multicolored appearances remain urgent needs particularly in real&#8208;world applications. Here, a fiber&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (FDSSC) integrated with a light diffusion layer composed of alumina/polyurethane film on the outmost encapsulating tube and a light conversion layer made from phosphors/TiO2/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) film on the inner counter electrode is designed. The incident light is diffused to more surfaces of fiber electrodes, then converted on counter electrode and reflected to neighboring photoanode, so the FDSSC efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for remarkably enhanced light harvesting, producing a record PCE of 13.11%. These efficient FDSSCs also realize color&#8208;tunable appearances, improving their designability and compatibility with textiles.

     alt="Integrating Light Diffusion and Conversion Layers for Highly Efficient Multicolored Fiber-Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber-dye-sensitized solar cell integrated with light diffusion and conversion layers efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for more light harvesting, producing a record power conversion efficiency of 13.11%. It can be also made with color-tunable appearance and further integrated with fiber battery as next-generation power system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber solar cells as promising wearable power supplies have attracted increasing attentions recently, while further breakthrough on their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and realization of multicolored appearances remain urgent needs particularly in real-world applications. Here, a fiber-dye-sensitized solar cell (FDSSC) integrated with a light diffusion layer composed of alumina/polyurethane film on the outmost encapsulating tube and a light conversion layer made from phosphors/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/poly(vinylidene fluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-hexafluoropropylene) film on the inner counter electrode is designed. The incident light is diffused to more surfaces of fiber electrodes, then converted on counter electrode and reflected to neighboring photoanode, so the FDSSC efficiently takes advantage of the fiber shape for remarkably enhanced light harvesting, producing a record PCE of 13.11%. These efficient FDSSCs also realize color-tunable appearances, improving their designability and compatibility with textiles. They are further integrated with fiber batteries as power systems, providing a power solution for wearables and emerging smart textiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designable Photo&#8208;Responsive Micron&#8208;Scale Ultrathin Peptoid Nanobelts for Enhanced Performance on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D photo&#8208;responsive ultrathin peptoid nanobelts (UTPNBs) with a thickness of &#8776;2.2&#160;nm and a length in micrometers are generated through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic azobenzene&#8208;containing ternary alternating peptoids, undergoing a reversible transition from UTPNBs to nanospheres. Structural superiorities of UTPNBs enable them to serve as favorable scaffolds for the potential on electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions, whose overpotential is 28 mV.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;reactive single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) based on long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered ultrathin organic nanomaterials (UTONMs) (i.e., below 3&#160;nm) provides a significant tactic for the advancement in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) but remains challenging. Herein, photo&#8208;responsive ultrathin peptoid nanobelts (UTPNBs) with a thickness of &#8776;2.2&#160;nm and micron&#8208;scaled length are generated using the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;containing amphiphilic ternary alternating peptoids. The pendants hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism reveals the formation of 1D ultralong UTPNBs, whose thickness is dictated by the length of side groups that are linked to peptoid backbones. The photo&#8208;responsive feature is demonstrated by a reversible morphological transformation from UTPNBs to nanospheres (21.5&#160;nm) upon alternative irradiation with UV and visible lights. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performance of these aggregates co&#8208;decorated with nitrogen&#8208;rich ligand of terpyridine (TE) and uniformly&#8208;distributed atomic platinum (Pt) is evaluated toward HER, with a photo&#8208;controllable electrocatalyst activity that highly depended on both the presence of Pt element and structural characteristic of substrates. The Pt&#8208;based SACs using TE&#8208;modified UTPNBs as support exhibit a favorable electrocatalytic capacity with an overpotential of &#8776;28&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents a promising strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTONMs&#8208;based catalysts with controllable HER catalytic performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Toughness CO2&#8208;Sourced Ionic Polyurea Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant challenge in the performance of polyurea (PUa) adhesives arises from the trade&#8208;off between cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. Herein, a series of multifunctional ionic PUa adhesives is synthesized by post&#8208;ionization and anion&#8208;exchange of CO2&#8208;sourced PUa. The incorporation of ionic segments imparts the adhesives with ultratough adhesion strength.








Abstract
Polyurea (PUa) adhesives are renowned for their exceptional adhesion to diverse substrates even in harsh environments. However, the presence of quadruple bidentate intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the polymer chains creates a trade&#8208;off between cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. To overcome this challenge, a series of CO2&#8208;sourced ionic PUa adhesives with ultratough adhesion to various substrates are developed. The incorporated ionic segments within the adhesive serve to partially mitigate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions while conferring unique electrostatic interactions, leading to both high cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. The maximum adhesive strength of 10.9&#160;MPa can be attained by ionizing the CO2&#8208;sourced PUa using bromopropane and subsequently exchanging the anion with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. Additionally, these ionic PUa adhesives demonstrate several desirable properties such as low&#8208;temperature stability (&#8722;80&#160;&#176;C), resistance to organic solvents and water, high flame retardancy, antibacterial activity, and UV&#8208;fluorescence, thereby expanding their potential applications. This study presents a general and effective approach for designing high&#8208;strength adhesives suitable for a wide array of uses.

         <dc:description>
In this work, a unique triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D covalent organic framework membranes (3D COFMs) is developed. Besides, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with high intrinsic THz conductivities.








Abstract
Processable covalent organic framework membranes (COFM) are emerging as potential semiconducting materials for device applications. Nevertheless, the fabrication of crystalline and free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is challenging. In this work, a unique time and solvent&#8208;efficient triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D COFMs from a single system is developed. Besides, for the first time, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with very high intrinsic THz conductivities. The evaluated scattering time and plasma frequency of the free carriers of the COFMs are highly promising for future applications in optoelectronic devices in THz frequencies.

Side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized. The polymer with a simple skeleton enables organic solar cells with over 19% efficiency and supplies active layers with processing endurance in high humidity air.








Abstract
Development of polymer donors with simple chemical structure and low cost is of great importance for commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a simply 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized in comparison with its alternating copolymer PTQ11. Relative to molecular weight (Mn) of 28.3&#160;kg mol&#8722;1 for PTQ11, the random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with minor siloxane decoration is beneficial for achieving higher Mn up to 51.1&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. In addition, PMQ&#8208;Si605 can show stronger aggregation ability and faster charge mobility as well as more efficient exciton dissociation in active layer as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. With L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F as acceptor, its PMQ&#8208;Si605 based OSCs display power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.08%, much higher than 16.21% for PTQ11 based devices. With another acceptor BTP&#8208;H2 to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PMQ&#8208;Si605, further elevated PCEs of 18.50% and 19.15% can be achieved with the binary and ternary OSCs, respectively. Furthermore, PMQ&#8208;Si605 based active layers are suitable for processing in high humidity air, an important factor for massive production of OSCs. Therefore, the siloxane decoration on polymer donors is promising, affording PMQ&#8208;Si605 as a high&#8208;performing and low cost candidate.

Therefore, the siloxane decoration on polymer donors is promising, affording PMQ-Si605 as a high-performing and low cost candidate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Repeatedly Programmable Liquid Crystal Dielectric Elastomer with Multimodal Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple electric actuation modes can be achieved in a single liquid crystal dielectric elastomer based on its reversible shape changing between the permanent and temporary shape. The independent programmability of these two shapes offers high freedom to fabricate multimodal dielectric actuators with designable actions, which can be triggered at a low electric field due to the space charge mechanism.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are actuatable under an electric field, whose large strain and fast response speed compare favorably with natural muscles. However, the actuation of DE&#8208;based devices is generally limited to a single mode and cannot be reconfigured after fabrication, which pales in comparison to biological counterparts given the ability to alter actuation modes according to external conditions. To address this, liquid crystal dielectric elastomers (LC&#8208;DEs) that can alter the dielectric actuation modes based on the thermally triggered shape&#8208;changing are prepared. Specifically, the two shapes through the LC phase transition possess different bending stiffness, which leads to distinct actuation modes after an electric field is applied. Moreover, the two shapes can be individually programmed/reprogrammed, that is, the one before the transition is regulated through force&#8208;directed solvent evaporation and the one after the transition is via bond exchange&#8208;enabled stress relaxation. As such, the multimodal dielectric actuation behaviors upon temperature change can be readily diversified. Meanwhile, the space charge mechanism endows LC&#8208;DEs with the significantly reduced driving e&#8208;field (8 V &#181;m&#8722;1) and bidirectional actuation manners. It is believed this unique adaptivity in the actuation modes under a low electric field shall offer versatile designs for practical soft robots.

         <title>Synergy of Pd2+/S2&#8722;&#8208;Doped TiO2 Supported on 2&#8208;Methylimidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Polypyrrole/Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Nitrogen Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd2+&#8208; and S2&#8722;&#8208;doped TiO2 immobilized on 2&#8208;methylimidazolium functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide (2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO) exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward nitrogen oxidation reaction due to the synergistic effect of each component. Especially, the sulfate radicals in situ formed on Pb/S&#8211;TiO2@2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO further promote nitrogen adsorption and decrease the reaction energy barrier, resulting in the acceleration of nitrogen oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of nitrate catalyzed by electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is considered as an alternative and sustainable approach to the conventional industrial manufacture, but optimizing the electrocatalytic NOR performance and fabricating the efficient NOR electrocatalysts at the design level still encounter great challenges. Herein, unique Pd2+&#8208; and S2&#8722;&#8208;doped TiO2 (Pb/S&#8211;TiO2) nanoparticles are successfully in situ grown on the surface of 2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide (2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO), which present the typical hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures, resulting in the excellent electrocatalytic NOR performance with the highest NO3&#8722; yield of 72.69 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1act. and the maximum Faraday efficiency of 8.92% at 2.04&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) due to the synergistic effect of each component. Due to the doping effect, the appropriate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is achieved by Ti&#8208;site, where OER principally occurs, providing *O during the non&#8208;electrochemical step of NOR, while the electrocatalytic NOR process as the electrochemical conversion of inert N2 to active *NO intermediates mainly occurs at the Pd&#8208;site. Especially, the sulfate radicals in situ formed on Pb/S&#8211;TiO2@2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO further promote nitrogen adsorption and decrease the reaction energy barrier, resulting in the acceleration of NOR. It provides theoretical and practical experience for the design and preparation of NOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Dual Polymerized Y&#8208;Acceptors of Distinct&#8208;Dimensionality Create Neuron&#8208;Like Interpenetrating Hierarchical Network towards Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D Y&#8208;branched regio&#8208;regular polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptor PYBF is synthesized, which exhibits more crystalline and face&#8208;on&#8208;oriented domains. 1D PYIT is further introduced into the PM6:PYBF system for forming the interconnective neuron&#8208;like dual&#8208;acceptor domains. Consequently, the device realizes a best power conversion efficiency of &#8776;17% with simultaneously enhanced stabilities.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells have garnered particular attention thanks to their superior thermal, photo, and mechanical stabilities for large&#8208;scale manufacturing, yet the performance enhancement remains largely restrained by inherent morphological challenges of the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer. Herein, a 3D Y&#8208;branched polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptor named PYBF, characteristic of high molecular weight and glass transition temperature, is designed and synthesized by precisely linking C3h&#8208;symmetric benzotrifuran with Y6 acceptors. In comparison to the benchmark thiophene&#8208;bridged linear PYIT acceptor, an optical blue&#8208;shift absorption is observed for PYBF yet a slightly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7% (vs 15.14%) is obtained when paired with polymer donor PM6, which benefit from the more crystalline and face&#8208;on&#8208;oriented PYBF domains. However, the star&#8208;like bulky structure of PYBF results in the nucleation&#8208;growth dominant phase&#8208;separation in polymeric blends, which generates stumpy droplet&#8208;like acceptor fibrils and impairs the continuity of acceptor phases. This issue is however surprisingly resolved by incorporating a small amount of PYIT, which leads to the formation of the more interconnective neuron&#8208;like dual&#8208;acceptor domains by long&#8208;chain entanglements of linear acceptors and alleviates bimolecular recombination. Thus, the champion device realizes a respectable PCE of up to &#8776;17% and importantly exhibits thermal and storage stabilities superior to the linear counterpart.

         <title>4D Printed Non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;Plate Jellyfish Inspired Soft Robot in Diverse Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robot movement in organic solvents is a formidable challenge in robot technology. This study proposes a 4D&#8208;programmable strategy based on a low&#8208;crosslinked network to fabricate a non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate and jellyfish&#8208;inspired soft robot capable of swimming in diverse organic solvents.








Abstract
Soft robots have the potential to assist and complement human exploration of extreme and harsh environments (i.e., organic solvents). However, soft robots with stable performance in diverse organic solvents are not developed yet. In the current research, a non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate under&#8208;liquid soft robot inspired by jellyfish based on phototropic liquid crystal elastomers is fabricated via a 4D&#8208;programmable strategy. Specifically, the robot employs a 3D&#8208;printed non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate, designed with Archimedean orientation, which undergoes autonomous deformation to release internal stress when immersed in organic solvents. With the assistance of near&#8208;infrared light illumination, the organic solvent inside the robot vaporizes and generates propulsion in the form of bubble streams. The developed NEP&#8208;Jelly&#8208;inspired soft robot can swim with a high degree of freedom in various organic solvents, for example, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, and trichloromethane, which is not reported before. Besides bionic jellyfish, various aquatic invertebrate&#8208;inspired soft robots can potentially be prepared via a similar 4D&#8208;programmable strategy.

         <title>Giant Negative Photoresponse in van der Waals Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/Graphene Trilayer Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is employed to achieve a giant negative photoconductance (NPC) effect in a graphene/AgBiP2Se6/graphene van der Waals vertical heterostructure device by applying a high drain&#8208;source voltage bias. Remarkably, this device demonstrates an exceptionally high negative responsivity (R) of 4.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, surpassing the previous records for NPC photodetectors.








Abstract
The positive photoconductive (PPC) effect is a well&#8208;established primary detection mechanism employed by photodetectors. In contrast, the negative photoconductive (NPC) effect is not extensively investigated thus far, and research on the NPC effect is still in its early stage. Herein, a quaternary van der Waals material, AgBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is discovered to achieve a giant NPC effect. Through experimental observations in a Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/ Graphene&#8208;based vertical photodetector, an irreversible conversion is identified from common PPC photoresponse to atypical NPC photoresponse. Notably, this device demonstrates an exceptionally high negative responsivity (R) of 4.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, surpassing the previous records for NPC photodetectors. Additionally, it exhibits remarkable optoelectronic performances, including an external quantum efficiency of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;108% and a detectivity (D) of 3.60&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones. The exceptionally high NPC photoresponse observed in this device can be attributed to the swift suppression of photogenerated free carriers at robust recombination centers situated at significant depths, induced by the elevated drain&#8208;source voltage bias. The remarkably high NPC photoresponse also positions AgBiP2Se6 as a promising 2D material for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and an excellent platform for systematic exploration of the NPC effect.

         <title>Optimizing Edge Active Sites via Intrinsic In&#8208;Plane Iridium Deficiency in Layered Iridium Oxides for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition of a bulk layered iridate Na2IrO3 in acid and subsequent exfoliation produces iridium oxide nanosheets. The nanosheet material consists of robust honeycomb&#8208;type layers of edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral framework, creating a unique local environment of edge active sites&#8212;the edge iridium site adjacent to one intrinsic iridium vacancy&#8212;for effectively catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Improving catalytic activity of surface iridium sites without compromising catalytic stability is the core task of designing more efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. This work presents phase transition of a bulk layered iridate Na2IrO3 in acid solution at room temperature, and subsequent exfoliation to produce 2D iridium oxide nanosheets with around 4&#160;nm thickness. The nanosheets consist of OH&#8208;terminated, honeycomb&#8208;type layers of edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral framework with intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency. The nanosheet material is among the most active Ir&#8208;based catalysts reported for acidic OER and gives an iridium mass activity improvement up to a factor of 16.5 over rutile IrO2 nanoparticles. The material also exhibits good catalytic and structural stability and retains the catalytic activity for more than 1300 h. The combined experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that edge Ir sites of the layer are active centers for OER, with structural hydroxyl groups participating in the catalytic cycle of OER via a non&#8208;traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. The existence of intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency is the key to building a unique local environment of edge active sites that have optimal surface oxygen adsorption properties and thereby high catalytic activity.

         <title>CO2 Enrichment Boosts Highly Selective Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to CH4 by UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 photocatalyst is designed by combining the merits of porous UiO&#8208;66 and metallic Co9S8, which endow them with exceptional IR light absorption and enriched local CO2 concentration, contributing to efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. The high&#8208;electron&#8208;density metallic active sites benefit the further reduction of *CO intermediates. Thus, UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 achieves a high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction toward CH4 with near 100% selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value chemicals is an attractive approach to mitigate climate change, but it remains a great challenge to produce a specific product selectively by IR light. Hence, UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 composite is designed to couple the advantages of metallic photocatalysts and porous CO2 adsorbers for IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. The metallic nature of Co9S8 endows UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 with exceptional IR light absorption, while UiO&#8208;66 dramatically enhances its local CO2 concentration, revealed by&#160;finite&#8208;element method simulations. As a result, Co9S8 or UiO&#8208;66 alone does not show observable IR&#8208;light photocatalytic activity, whereas UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 exhibits exceptional activity. The CH4 evolution rate over UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 reaches 25.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with ca.100% selectivity under IR light irradiation, outperforming most reported catalysts under similar reaction conditions. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy spectra verify the presence of two distinct Co sites and confirm the existence of metallic Co&#9472;Co bond in Co9S8. Energy diagrams analysis and transient absorption spectra manifest that CO2 reduction mainly occurs on Co9S8 for UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8, while density functional theory calculations demonstrate that high&#8208;electron&#8208;density Co1 sites are the key active sites, possessing lower energy barriers for further protonation of *CO, leading to the ultra&#8208;high selectivity toward CH4.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalized Graphdiyne Derivative as a Cathode Interface Layer with High Thickness Tolerance for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino&#8208;functionalized graphdiyne derivative (GDY&#8208;N), with its high conductivity, appropriate LUMO energy level, and good solubility in alcohols, emerges as a remarkable cathode interlayer material. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.30% is achieved for D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices (certified result: 19.05%). This value is one of the highest reported for OSCs to date.








Abstract
Efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) are essential components for effectively enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although high&#8208;performance CIMs are desired to meet the requirements of various OSCs, potential candidates for CIMs are scarce. Herein, an amino&#8208;functionalized graphdiyne derivative (GDY&#8208;N) is developed, which represents the first example of GDY that exhibits favorable solubility in alcohol. Utilizing GDY&#8208;N as the CIM, an outstanding champion PCE of 19.30% for devices based on the D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO (certified result: 19.05%) is achieved, which is among the highest efficiencies reported to date in OSCs. Remarkably, the devices based on GDY&#8208;N exhibit a thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristic, maintaining 95% of their initial efficiency even with a film thickness of 25&#160;nm. Moreover, the GDY&#8208;N displays wide universality and facilitates exceptional stability in OSCs. This work not only enriches the diversity of GDY&#160;derivatives, but also demonstrates the feasibility of GDY derivatives as CIMs with high thickness tolerance in OSCs.

An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.30% is achieved for D18-Cl:L8-BO-based devices (certified result: 19.05%). This value is one of the highest reported for OSCs to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) are essential components for effectively enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although high-performance CIMs are desired to meet the requirements of various OSCs, potential candidates for CIMs are scarce. Herein, an amino-functionalized graphdiyne derivative (GDY-N) is developed, which represents the first example of GDY that exhibits favorable solubility in alcohol. Utilizing GDY-N as the CIM, an outstanding champion PCE of 19.30% for devices based on the D18-Cl:L8-BO (certified result: 19.05%) is achieved, which is among the highest efficiencies reported to date in OSCs. Remarkably, the devices based on GDY-N exhibit a thickness-insensitive characteristic, maintaining 95% of their initial efficiency even with a film thickness of 25&#160;nm. Moreover, the GDY-N displays wide universality and facilitates exceptional stability in OSCs. This work not only enriches the diversity of GDY&#160;derivatives, but also demonstrates the feasibility of GDY derivatives as CIMs with high thickness tolerance in OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Molecules Adsorption&#8208;Induced Zincophilic&#8208;Hydrophobic Protective Layer Enables Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive molecular conformation of Tween&#8208;20 electrolyte additive with both zincophilic and hydrophobic units can not only inhibit the water&#8208;related side reactions, but also induce Zn (002) oriented growth, significantly improving the cycle life and Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal anodes.








Abstract
Zn metal, as one of the most promising anode materials for aqueous batteries, suffers from uncontrollable dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, which drastically compromise its cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, a nonionic amphipathic additive Tween&#8208;20 (TW20) is proposed that bears both zincophilic and hydrophobic units. The zincophilic segment of TW20 preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode, while the hydrophobic segment is exposed on the electrolyte side, forming an electrolyte&#8208;facing hydrophobic layer that shields the anode from active water molecules. Moreover, theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the TW20 additive can induce the preferential growth of (002) plane by adsorbing on other facets, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from these advantages, the stability and reversibility of Zn anodes are substantially improved, reflected by stable cycling for over 2500&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 as well as an average CE of 99.4% at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The full cells paired with MnO2 demonstrate a long lifespan for more than 700 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work is expected to provide a new approach to modulate Zn electrode interface chemistry for highly stable Zn anodes.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Assisted Assembly of Colloidal Nanoparticles into Wafer&#8208;Scale Monolayers in Seconds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;assisted assembly, inspired by Mussel's underwater adhesion, promises scalable but swift self&#8208;limiting assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production. The efficient transport of nanoparticles is realized from a microscopic volume of water into the wafer&#8208;scale monolayers within several seconds, stemming from the electrostatically accelerated nanoparticle's diffusion.








Abstract
Underwater adhesion processes in nature promise controllable assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production; However, their artificial strategies have faced challenges to uniformly transfer nanoparticles into a monolayer, particularly those below 100&#160;nm in size, over large areas. Here a scalable &#8220;one&#8208;shot&#8221; self&#8208;limiting nanoparticle transfer technique is presented, enabling the efficient transport of nanoparticles from water in microscopic volumes to an entire 2&#8208;inch wafer in a remarkably short time of 10 seconds to reach near&#8208;maximal surface coverage (&#8776;40%) in a 2D mono&#8208;layered fashion. Employing proton engineering in electrostatic assembly accelerates the diffusion of nanoparticles (over 50 &#181;m2/s), resulting in a hundredfold faster coating speed than the previously reported results in the literature. This charge&#8208;sensitive process further enables &#8220;pick&#8208;and&#8208;place&#8221; nanoparticle patterning at the wafer scale, with large flexibility in surface materials, including flexible metal oxides and 3D&#8208;printed polymers. As a result, the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale disordered plasmonic metasurfaces in seconds is successfully demonstrated. These metasurfaces exhibit consistent resonating colors across diverse material and geometrical platforms, showcasing their potential for applications in full&#8208;color painting and optical encryption devices.

Electrostatic Nanoparticle Coating
In article 2313299, Doeun Kim, Hyeon&#8208;Ho Jeong, and co&#8208;authors demonstrate a scalable &#8220;one&#8208;shot&#8221; self&#8208;limiting nanoparticle assembly inspired by the underwater adhesion observed in mussels. This technique facilitates the formation of mono&#8208;layered nanoparticle assemblies, extending from micro&#8208;patterns to covering an entire 2&#8208;inch wafer. The authors illustrate this capability through the creation of disordered plasmonic metasurfaces, highlighting their features in full&#8208;color painting and charge&#8208;sensitive &#8220;pick&#8208;and&#8208;place&#8221; nanoparticle patterning.

         <title>Redox Gating for Colossal Carrier Modulation and Unique Phase Control (Adv. Mater. 16/2024)</title>

Redox Gating
In article number 2308871, Matthew V. Tirrell, Hua Zhou, Wei Chen, and their co&#8208;workers introduce redox gating, a novel method for manipulating carriers and controlling the electronic state within the sub&#8208;volt range. This innovative approach involves generating a significant number of free carriers within the redox gating medium, which are then injected into the adjacent perovskite thin film. Notably, this injection induces substantial changes in the electronic state at low gate voltages, all without generating defects. The green threads depicted in the illustration represent the functional molecules used for redox gating. By offering a means to manipulate the electronic properties of various materials at low power levels, ranging from traditional semiconductors to complex, strongly correlated systems, redox gating holds promise for mimicking the synaptic switching observed in the human brain, as represented by the underlying synapse, and enhancing reconfigurable quantum devices.

         <title>Building Stable Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the fundamental challenges associated with sodium metal anodes (SMAs) for high&#8208;rate sodium metal batteries, and it systematically discusses general modifications of Na battery components and emerging strategies to stabilize SMAs. Finally, the review ends with the perspective on future development of high&#8208;rate sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Due to low cost and high energy density, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted growing interest, with great potential to power future electric vehicles (EVs) and mobile electronics, which require rapid charge/discharge capability. However, the development of high&#8208;rate SMBs has been impeded by the sluggish Na+ ion kinetics, particularly at the sodium metal anode (SMA). The high&#8208;rate operation severely threatens the SMA stability, due to the unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Na dendrite growth, and large volume changes during Na plating&#8208;stripping cycles, leading to rapid electrochemical performance degradations. This review surveys key challenges faced by high&#8208;rate SMAs, and highlights representative stabilization strategies, including the general modification of SMB components (including the host, Na metal surface, electrolyte, separator, and cathode), and emerging solutions with the development of solid&#8208;state SMBs and liquid metal anodes; the working principle, performance, and application of these strategies are elaborated, to reduce the Na nucleation energy barriers and promote Na+ ion transfer kinetics for stable high&#8208;rate Na metal anodes. This review will inspire further efforts to stabilize SMAs and other metal (e.g., Li, K, Mg, Zn) anodes, promoting high&#8208;rate applications of high&#8208;energy metal batteries towards a more sustainable society.

         <title>Strategies for the Nuclear Delivery of Metal Complexes to Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of new antitumoral metallodrugs is a centerpiece in the fight against drug&#8208;resistant tumors. In this context, the design of novel metal complexes that display great selectivity for cancer cells and accumulate in the nucleus is one objective to strive toward. This review discusses existing strategies and perspectives for the rational design of future metallodrug candidates.








Abstract
The nucleus is an essential organelle for the function of cells. It holds most of the genetic material and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Since many antitumoral therapies target nucleic acids to induce cell death, tumor&#8208;specific nuclear drug delivery could potentiate therapeutic effects and prevent potential off&#8208;target side effects on healthy tissue. Due to their great structural variety, good biocompatibility, and unique physico&#8208;chemical properties, organometallic complexes and other metal&#8208;based compounds have sparked great interest as promising anticancer agents. In this review, strategies for specific nuclear delivery of metal complexes are summarized and discussed to highlight crucial parameters to consider for the design of new metal complexes as anticancer drug candidates. Moreover, the existing opportunities and challenges of tumor&#8208;specific, nucleus&#8208;targeting metal complexes are emphasized to outline some new perspectives and help in the design of new cancer treatments.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Crystalline Frameworks Toward Promising Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs) with functional frameworks, tailored porosity, and high surface areas garner significant attention. This review focuses on their rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications, emphasizes crystallization approaches and structural control, and provides MCF components (metals, metal oxides, sulfides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) and applications in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis.








Abstract
Ordered mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs), which possess both functional frameworks and well&#8208;defined porosity, receive considerable attention because of their unique properties including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tailored porous structures, and compositions. Construction of novel crystalline mesoporous architectures that allows for rich accessible active sites and efficient mass transfer is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for potential energy&#8208;related applications. In this review, the rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications of MCFs are the main focus. After summarizing the synthetic approaches, an emphasis is placed on the delicate control of crystallites, mesophases, and nano&#8208;architectures by concluding basic principles and showing representative examples. Afterward, the currently fabricated components of MCFs such as metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks are described in sequence. Further, typical applications of MCFs in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis are highlighted. This review ends with the possible development and synthetic challenges of MCFs as well as a future prospect for high&#8208;efficiency energy applications, which underscores a pathway for developing advanced materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Materials for CO2 and CH4 Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the challenges of CH4 and CO2 catalytic conversion and benefits offered by single&#8208;atom alloy (SAAs). It details synthesis strategies and characterization methods and examines research on SAAs in CO2 and CH4 conversion, focusing on the intricate mechanisms affecting activity and product selectivity. Future prospects and challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion are also presented.








Abstract
The catalytic conversion of greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 constitutes an effective approach for alleviating the greenhouse effect and generating valuable chemical products. However, the intricate molecular characteristics characterized by high symmetry and bond energies, coupled with the complexity of associated reactions, pose challenges for conventional catalysts to attain high activity, product selectivity, and enduring stability. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) materials, distinguished by their tunable composition and unique electronic structures, confer versatile physicochemical properties and modulable functionalities. In recent years, SAAs materials demonstrate pronounced advantages and expansive prospects in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2. This review begins by introducing the challenges entailed in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2 and the advantages offered by SAAs. Subsequently, the intricacies of synthesis strategies employed for SAAs are presented and characterization techniques and methodologies are introduced. The subsequent section furnishes a meticulous and inclusive overview of research endeavors concerning SAAs in CO2 catalytic conversion, CH4 conversion, and synergy CH4 and CO2 conversion. The particular emphasis is directed toward scrutinizing the intricate mechanisms underlying the influence of SAAs on reaction activity and product selectivity. Finally, insights are presented on the development and future challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion reactions.

As a pioneering battery technology, even though sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are safe, non&#8208;flammable, and capable of exhibiting better temperature endurance performance than lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because of lower energy density and larger ionic size, they are not amicable for large&#8208;scale applications. Generally, the electrochemical storage performance of a secondary battery can be improved by monitoring the composition and morphology of electrode materials. Because more is the intricacy of a nanostructured composite electrode material, more electrochemical storage applications would be expected. Despite the conventional methods suitable for practical production, the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) would offer enormous opportunities for next&#8208;generation battery applications by delicately systematizing the structure and composition at the molecular level to store sodium ions with larger sizes compared with lithium ions. Here, the review comprehensively discusses the progress of nanostructured MOFs and their derivatives applied as negative and positive electrode materials for effective sodium storage in SIBs. The commercialization goal has prompted the development of MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials, before which the synthesis and mechanism for MOF&#8208;based SIB electrodes with improved sodium storage performance are systematically discussed. Finally, the existing challenges, possible perspectives, and future opportunities will be anticipated.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Delivery Systems for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advancements and application prospects of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular delivery systems (SDSs) based on pillararenes, including molecular&#8208;scale SDSs, supramolecular nano self&#8208;assembly, and nanohybrid SDSs for cancer therapy, are highlighted, and the development prospects and challenges of pillararene&#8208;based SDSs for cancer therapy are also discussed.








Abstract
Cancer poses a significant challenge to global public health, seriously threatening human health and life. Although various therapeutic strategies, such as chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy, phototherapy, and starvation therapy, are applied to cancer treatment, their limited therapeutic effect, severe side effects, and unsatisfactory drug release behavior need to be carefully considered. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop efficient drug delivery strategies for improving cancer treatment efficacy and realizing on&#8208;demand drug delivery. Notably, pillararenes, as an emerging class of supramolecular macrocycles, possess unique properties of highly tunable structures, superior host&#8211;guest chemistry, facile modification, and good biocompatibility, which are widely used in cancer therapy to achieve controllable drug release and reduce the toxic side effects on normal tissues under various internal/external stimuli conditions. This review summarizes the recent advance of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular delivery systems (SDSs) based on pillararenes for tumor therapy from the perspectives of different assembly methods and hybrid materials, including molecular&#8208;scale SDSs, supramolecular nano self&#8208;assembly delivery systems, and nanohybrid SDSs. Moreover, the prospects and critical challenges of stimuli&#8208;responsive SDSs based on pillararenes for cancer therapy are also discussed.

         <title>Interface Engineering for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic improvements and interface engineering plays a crucial role. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advancements in interface engineering, including the design of interfaces, the functionalities they offer, and their impact on device performance. Future challenges and potential research directions are outlined associated with interface engineering for large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and cost&#8208;effective OSCs.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic advancements during the past decades owing to the innovative material design and device structure optimization, with power conversion efficiencies surpassing 19% and 20% for single&#8208;junction and tandem devices, respectively. Interface engineering, by modifying interface properties between different layers for OSCs, has become a vital part to promote the device efficiency. It is essential to elucidate the intrinsic working mechanism of interface layers, as well as the related physical and chemical processes that manipulate device performance and long&#8208;term stability. In this article, the advances in interface engineering aimed to pursue high&#8208;performance OSCs are reviewed. The specific functions and corresponding design principles of interface layers are summarized first. Then, the anode interface layer, cathode interface layer in single&#8208;junction OSCs, and interconnecting layer of tandem devices are discussed in separate categories, and the interface engineering&#8208;related improvements on device efficiency and stability are analyzed. Finally, the challenges and prospects associated with application of interface engineering are discussed with the emphasis on large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost device manufacturing.

         <title>Why the Synthesis Affects Performance of Layered Transition Metal Oxide Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO2 or NCM) is the most widely used cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries; so, it is crucial to deeply understand the relationship among synthesis, structure, and performance. However, the present understanding of the structural evolution process remains incomplete. Strictly speaking, synthesis determines structure, structure determines performance, and the material's structure plays a significant role.








Abstract
The limited cyclability of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO2) cathode materials poses a significant challenge to the industrialization of batteries incorporating these materials. This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li+ migration. In addition, the presence of synthesis&#8208;induced heterogeneous phases and lattice defects cannot be disregarded as they also contribute to the degradation in performance. Therefore, gaining a profound understanding of the intricate relationship among material synthesis, structure, and performance is imperative for the development of LiTMO2. This paper highlights the pivotal role of structural play in LiTMO2 materials and provides a comprehensive overview of how various control factors influence the specific pathways of structural evolution during the synthesis process. In addition, it summarizes the scientific challenges associated with diverse modification approaches currently employed to address the cyclic failure of materials. The overarching goal is to provide readers with profound insights into the study of LiTMO2.

         <title>Unveiling Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments in Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the perspective of theoretical vision and experimental progress, the ever&#8208;changing electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction is reviewed to show the research progress and design ideas of advanced catalysts, to gain insight into the mechanism and advanced theory of nitrate to ammonia conversion, and to clarify the development direction of electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
The excessive enrichment of nitrate in the environment can be converted into ammonia (NH3) through electrochemical processes, offering significant implications for modern agriculture and the potential to reduce the burden of the Haber&#8211;Bosch (HB) process while achieving environmentally friendly NH3 production. Emerging research on electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (eNitRR) to NH3 has gained considerable momentum in recent years for efficient NH3 synthesis. However, existing reviews on nitrate reduction have primarily focused on limited aspects, often lacking a comprehensive summary of catalysts, reaction systems, reaction mechanisms, and detection methods employed in nitrate reduction. This review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the eNitRR field by integrating existing research progress and identifying current challenges. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress achieved using various materials in electrochemical nitrate reduction, elucidates the underlying theoretical mechanism behind eNitRR, and discusses effective strategies based on numerous case studies to enhance the electrochemical reduction from NO3&#727; to NH3. Finally, this review discusses challenges and development prospects in the eNitRR field with an aim to guide design and development of large&#8208;scale sustainable nitrate reduction electrocatalysts.

         <title>Surface Engineered Single&#8208;atom Systems for Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 16, April 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support surface engineering to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a promising strategy for energy conversion due to the various advantageous properties. This review summarizes the research progress in surface&#8208;engineered SACs for energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and different devices, which is anticipated to promote the rational design and development of SACs with surface engineering for advanced energy conversion.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are demonstrated to show exceptional reactivity and selectivity in catalytic reactions by effectively utilizing metal species, making them a favorable choice among the different active materials for energy conversion. However, SACs are still in the early stages of energy conversion, and problems like agglomeration and low energy conversion efficiency are hampering their practical applications. Substantial research focus on support modifications, which are vital for SAC reactivity and stability due to the intimate relationship between metal atoms and support. In this review, a category of supports and a variety of surface engineering strategies employed in SA systems are summarized, including surface site engineering (heteroatom doping, vacancy introducing, surface groups grafting, and coordination tunning) and surface structure engineering (size/morphology control, cocatalyst deposition, facet engineering, and crystallinity control). Also, the merits of support surface engineering in single&#8208;atom systems are systematically introduced. Highlights are the comprehensive summary and discussions on the utilization of surface&#8208;engineered SACs in diversified energy conversion applications including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and energy conversion devices. At the end of this review, the potential and obstacles of using surface&#8208;engineered SACs in the field of energy conversion are discussed. This review aims to guide the rational design and manipulation of SACs for target&#8208;specific applications by capitalizing on the characteristic benefits of support surface engineering.

         <title>Mitigating the Overheat of Stretchable Electronic Devices Via High&#8208;Enthalpy Thermal Dissipation of Hydrogel Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel modular encapsulation strategy that provides high enthalpy thermal dissipation for mitigating the overheat of stretchable electronics is proposed. The hydrogel&#8208;based&#160;encapsulation can provide thermal protection through water evaporation and automatically recover its functions by absorbing moisture. This method &#160;provides a universal pathway for improving the thermal stability of stretchable electronics in practical applications.








Abstract
The practical application of flexible and stretchable electronics is significantly influenced by their thermal and chemical stability. Elastomer substrates and encapsulation, due to their soft polymer chains and high surface&#8208;area&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, are particularly susceptible to high temperatures and flame. Excessive heat poses a severe threat of damage and decomposition to these elastomers. By leveraging water as a high enthalpy dissipating agent, here, a hydrogel encapsulation strategy is proposed to enhance the flame retardancy and thermal stability of stretchable electronics. The hydrogel&#8208;based encapsulation provides thermal protection against flames for more than 10 s through the evaporation of water. Further, the stretchability and functions automatically recover by absorbing air moisture. The incorporation of hydrogel encapsulation enables stretchable electronics to maintain their functions and perform complex tasks, such as fire saving in soft robotics and integrated electronics sensing. With high enthalpy heat dissipation, encapsulated soft electronic devices are effectively shielded and retain their full functionality. This strategy offers a universal method for flame retardant encapsulation of stretchable electronic devices.

         <title>Monochorionic Twinning in Bioengineered Human Embryo Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a thermoformed&#8208;based microwell platform culture conditions are identified to create human monochorionic twin blastoids from na&#239;ve pluripotent stem cells. Twin blastoids form through division of the pluripotent cell mass and implant with higher efficiency than singleton blastoids in a microfluidic endometrium&#8208;on&#8208;chip adhesion assay. This technology opens new avenues for in&#8208;depth exploration of monochorionic twin formation and its developmental implications.








Abstract
Monochorionic twinning of human embryos increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The rarity of such twinning events, combined with ethical constraints in human embryo research, makes investigating the mechanisms behind twinning practically infeasible. As a result, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the origins and early phenotypic presentation of monochorionic twin embryos. In this study, a microthermoformed&#8208;based microwell screening platform is used to identify conditions that efficiently induce monochorionic twins in human stem cell&#8208;based blastocyst models, termed &#8220;twin blastoids&#8221;. These twin blastoids contain a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium encasing two distinct inner cell masses (ICMs). Morphological and morphokinetic analyses reveal that twinning occurs during the cavitation phase via splitting of the OCT4+ pluripotent core. Notably, each ICM in twin blastoids contains its own NR2F2+ polar trophectoderm&#8208;like region, ready for implantation. This is functionally tested in a microfluidic chip&#8208;based implantation assay with epithelial endometrium cells. Under defined flow regimes, twin blastoids show increased adhesion capacity compared to singleton blastoids, suggestive of increased implantation potential. In conclusion, the development of technology enabling large&#8208;scale formation of twin blastoids, coupled with high&#8208;sensitivity readout capabilities, presents an unprecedented opportunity for systematically exploring monochorionic twin formation and its impact on embryonic development.

         <title>Symmetry Evolution Induced Two&#8208;Dimensional Pt Single Atom Catalyst with High Density for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts is greatly influenced by the chemical environment surrounding the central atom. In this study, a salt&#8208;assisted method was employed to transform the tetrahedral coordination structure of ZIF&#8208;8 into a planar square coordination structure without altering the ligands. During the subsequent carbonization process, concurrent with the evaporation of zinc atoms, the structure of the nitrogen and carbon carriers (NC carriers) undergo a transition from five&#8208;membered rings to six&#8208;membered rings to preserve the 2D structure. Following carbonization, the 2d&#8208;NC carrier predominantly comprises pyridine N within six&#8208;membered rings, whereas the 3d&#8208;NC carrier contains a higher proportion of pyrrole N within five&#8208;membered rings, along with graphite N that unavailable for coordination sites. This transition result in the generation of additional defect sites on the 2d&#8208;NC substrates. Hence, the Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with planar square coordination symmetries can be precisely prepared via electrodeposition (denoted as 2d&#8208;Pt SAC). By utilizing the structural characteristics of the 2d&#8208;NC carrier, it is beneficial to construct Pt SAs with higher density than that on 3d&#8208;NC. The Pt loading of 2d&#8208;Pt SAC is 0.49 &#177; 0.03 &#956;g cm&#8722;2, higher than that of 3d&#8208;Pt SAC (0.37 &#177; 0.04 &#956;g cm&#8722;2). In the context of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysis, these single atom catalysts with 2d coordination exhibited exchange current densities of 1.47 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, under an overpotential of 50 mV, it achieved mass activities of 2396 A gPt&#8722;1 (32 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst, 2 times higher than 3d&#8208;PtNC). Our findings elucidate the influence of coordination symmetry on the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts, offering a novel synthetic approach that may have implications for future industrial synthesis endeavors.

         <title>Microstrain&#8208;Stimulated Elastico&#8208;Mechanoluminescence with Dual&#8208;Mode Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient green&#8208;emitting elastio&#8208;mechanoluminescence with dual&#8208;mode stress sensing characteristics driven by microscale strain is developed in the LiTaO3:Tb3+, demonstrating the outstanding sensing capability for the amplitude and velocity of applied stress. Impressively, the fabricated thin film is capable of generating discernible mechanoluminescence signals even at low strain (500 &#181;st), indicating the significant prospect in advanced microstrain sensing area.








Abstract
Elastico&#8208;mechanoluminescence technology has shown significant application prospects in stress sensing, artificial skin, remote interaction, and other research areas. Its progress mainly lies in realizing stress visualization and 2D or even 3D stress&#8208;sensing effects using a passive sensing mode. However, the widespread promotion of mechanoluminescence (ML) technology is hindered by issues such as high stress or strain thresholds and a single sensing mode based on luminous intensity. In this study, a highly efficient green&#8208;emitting ML with dual&#8208;mode stress&#8208;sensing characteristics driven by microscale strain is developed using LiTaO3:Tb3+. In addition to single&#8208;mode sensing based on the luminous intensity, the self&#8208;defined parameter (Q) is also introduced as a dual&#8208;mode factor for sensing the stress velocity. Impressively, the fabricated LiTaO3:Tb3+ film is capable of generating discernible ML signals even when supplied with strains as low as 500 &#181;st. This is the current minimum strain value that can drive green&#8208;emitting ML. This study offers an ideal photonic platform for exploring the potential applications of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped elastico&#8208;ML materials in remote interaction devices, high&#8208;precision stress sensors, and single&#8208;molecule biological imaging.

Impressively, the fabricated LiTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; film is capable of generating discernible ML signals even when supplied with strains as low as 500 &#181;st. This is the current minimum strain value that can drive green-emitting ML. This study offers an ideal photonic platform for exploring the potential applications of rare-earth-doped elastico-ML materials in remote interaction devices, high-precision stress sensors, and single-molecule biological imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strengthening the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies in Electrocatalysts for Efficient Glycerol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the qualitative tuning of oxygen&#8208;vacancy density on the reaction pathway of glycerol electrooxidation (GOR) is investigated, demonstrating that the synergistic effect induced by neighboring oxygen vacancies effectively promotes the C&#9472;C bond cleavage of C2 intermediates to formate. This work offers insights for designing high&#8208;performance GOR electrocatalysts, facilitating the development of cost&#8208;effective and energy&#8208;saving chemical production technologies.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered bimetallic oxides exhibit high potential for the electrolysis of small organic molecules. However, the ambiguity in the relationship between the defect density and electrocatalytic performance makes it challenging to control the final products of multi&#8208;step multi&#8208;electron reactions in such electrocatalytic systems. In this study, controllable kinetics reduction is used to maximize the oxygen vacancy density of a Cu&#9472;Co oxide nanosheet (CuCo2O4 NS), which is used to catalyze the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GOR). The CuCo2O4&#8722;x NS with the highest oxygen&#8208;vacancy density (CuCo2O4&#8722;x&#8208;2) oxidizes C3 molecules to C1 molecules with selectivity of almost 100% and a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99%, showing the best oxidation performance among all the modified catalysts. Systems with multiple oxygen vacancies in close proximity to each other synergistically facilitate the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds. Density functional theory calculations confirm the ability of closely spaced oxygen vacancies to facilitate charge transfer between the catalyst and several key glycolic&#8208;acid (GCA) intermediates of the GOR process, thereby facilitating the decomposition of C2 intermediates to C1 molecules. This study reveals qualitatively in tuning the density of oxygen vacancies for altering the reaction pathway of GOR by the synergistic effects of spatial proximity of high&#8208;density oxygen vacancies.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation and Cascaded Sum Frequency Generation from a Surface Crystallized Glass Ceramic Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation (CSFG) are demonstrated in microspheres made of surface crystallized glass ceramics. Owing to random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm is demonstrated. The microspheres also boost the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of CSFG.








Abstract
The development of novel materials and structures for efficient second&#8208;order nonlinear micro/nano devices remains a significant challenge. In this study, the remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation in whispering gallery mode microspheres made of surface&#8208;crystallized glass with a 6&#8208;&#181;m Ba2TiSi2O8 crystal layer are demonstrated. Attributed to the core&#8211;shell design, the Ba2TiSi2O8 located on the surface can be efficiently coupled with whispering gallery modes, resulting in a highly efficient micron&#8208;scale cavity&#8208;enhanced second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Greatly enhanced SHG of the microcavity is observed, which is up to 80 times stronger than that of a non&#8208;resonant sample. Furthermore, owing to the wavelength non&#8208;selectivity of random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm and high&#8208;contrast polarization characteristics is demonstrated. The glass&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based microsphere cavity also boosts the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of cascaded sum frequency generation. This work delineates an efficient strategy for boosting nonlinear optical response in glass ceramics, which will open up new opportunities for applications in photonics and optical communications.

         <title>Living Artificial Skin: Photosensitizer and Cell Sandwiched Bacterial Cellulose for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial skin with bacterial cellulose sandwiched between photosensitizers (PS) and functionalized living cells are bioengineered. The outermost PS layers generate reactive oxygen species to efficiently combat bacterial infections, while the inner living cell layers near the diabetic wound serve as a living factory to continuously secrete VEGF to accelerate wound repair by promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis.








Abstract
Chronic wounds pose a significant global public health challenge due to their suboptimal treatment efficacy caused by bacterial infections and microcirculatory disturbances. Inspired by the biofunctionality of natural skin, an artificial skin (HV@BC@TBG) is bioengineered with bacterial cellulose (BC) sandwiched between photosensitizers (PS) and functionalized living cells. Glucose&#8208;modified PS (TBG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;functionalized living cells (HV) are successively modified on each side of BC through biological metabolism and bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction. As the outermost layer, the TBG layer can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light illumination to efficiently combat bacterial infections. The HV layer is the inner layer near the diabetic wound, which servs as a living factory to continuously secrete VEGF to accelerate wound repair by promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis. The sandwiched structural artificial skin HV@BC@TBG is nontoxic, biocompatible, and demonstrated its ability to significantly accelerate the healing process of infected diabetic wounds, rendering it a promising next&#8208;generation medical therapy for chronic wound management.

         <title>Structural Isomeric Effect on Spin Transport in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant difference of 700% in spin lifetimes between the structural isomers ITIC and BDTIC is observed. Experimental results and calculation demonstrate that the structural&#8208;isomeric&#8208;effect induced intramolecular noncovalent conformational locks are the direct reason for the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;coupling strength and thus decreased spin lifetime. These results will enrich the theoretical foundation for designing efficient spin&#8208;transport materials.








Abstract
Molecular semiconductor (MSC) is a promising candidate for spintronic applications benefiting from its long spin lifetime caused by light elemental&#8208;composition essence and thus weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). According to current knowledge, the SOC effect, normally dominated by the elemental composition, is the main spin&#8208;relaxation causation in MSCs, and thus the molecular structure&#8208;induced SOC change is one of the most concerned issues. In theoretical study, molecular isomerism, a most prototype phenomenon, has long been considered to possess little difference on spin transport previously, since elemental compositions of isomers are totally the same. However, here in this study, quite different spin&#8208;transport performances are demonstrated in ITIC and its structural isomers BDTIC experimentally, for the first time, though the charge transport and molecular stacking of the two films are very similar. By further experiments of electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, it is revealed that noncovalent&#8208;conformational locks (NCLs) formed in BDTIC can lead to enhancement of SOC and thus decrease the spin lifetime. Hence, this study suggests the influences from the structural&#8208;isomeric effect must be considered for developing highly efficient spin&#8208;transport MSCs, which also provides a reliable theoretical basis for solving the great challenge of quantificational measurement of NCLs in films in the future.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Drug Coordination Nanoparticles and Hydrogels for Enhanced Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many drug molecules are rich in metal coordination sites and they can form nanomaterials and soft materials, such as hydrogels upon coordination with various metal ions, allowing higher drug loading efficiency compared to adsorption based loading. At the same time, these materials allow controlled drug release and convenient delivery for treating a range of diseases.








Abstract
Drug delivery is a key component of nanomedicine, and conventional delivery relies on the adsorption or encapsulation of drug molecules to a nanomaterial. Many delivery vehicles contain metal ions, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXene, and noble metal nanoparticles. These materials have a high metal content and pose potential long&#8208;term toxicity concerns leading to difficulties for clinical approval. In this review, recent developments are summarized in the use of drug molecules as ligands for metal coordination forming various nanomaterials and soft materials. In these cases, the drug&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio is much higher than conventional adsorption&#8208;based strategies. The drug molecules are divided into small&#8208;molecule drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins. The formed hybrid materials mainly include nanoparticles and hydrogels, upon which targeting ligands can be grafted to improve efficacy and further decrease toxicity. The application of these materials for addressing cancer, viral infection, bacterial infection inflammatory bowel disease, and bone diseases is reviewed. In the end, some future directions are discussed from fundamental research, materials science, and medicine.

     alt="Metal&#8211;Drug Coordination Nanoparticles and Hydrogels for Enhanced Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drug molecules are rich in metal coordination sites and they can form nanomaterials and soft materials, such as hydrogels upon coordination with various metal ions, allowing higher drug loading efficiency compared to adsorption based loading. At the same time, these materials allow controlled drug release and convenient delivery for treating a range of diseases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug delivery is a key component of nanomedicine, and conventional delivery relies on the adsorption or encapsulation of drug molecules to a nanomaterial. Many delivery vehicles contain metal ions, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXene, and noble metal nanoparticles. These materials have a high metal content and pose potential long-term toxicity concerns leading to difficulties for clinical approval. In this review, recent developments are summarized in the use of drug molecules as ligands for metal coordination forming various nanomaterials and soft materials. In these cases, the drug-to-metal ratio is much higher than conventional adsorption-based strategies. The drug molecules are divided into small-molecule drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins. The formed hybrid materials mainly include nanoparticles and hydrogels, upon which targeting ligands can be grafted to improve efficacy and further decrease toxicity. The application of these materials for addressing cancer, viral infection, bacterial infection inflammatory bowel disease, and bone diseases is reviewed. In the end, some future directions are discussed from fundamental research, materials science, and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Laser Processing and Functionalizing PI/PDMS Composites for an On&#8208;Demand, Programmable, Recyclable Device Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable, reprogrammable, multifunctional, adhesive device patch is fabricated by simple and low&#8208;cost laser scribing of an adhesive composite with polyimide powders and amine&#8208;based ethoxylated polyethylenimine dispersed in the silicone elastomer. The obtained laser&#8208;induced graphene in the adhesive composite can be further selectively functionalized with conductive nanomaterials or enzymes for wiring/RF units or selective sensing of various sweat biomarkers.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;interfaced high&#8208;sensitive biosensing systems to detect electrophysiological and biochemical signals have shown great potential in personal health monitoring and disease management. However, the integration of 3D porous nanostructures for improved sensitivity and various functional composites for signal transduction/processing/transmission often relies on different materials and complex fabrication processes, leading to weak interfaces prone to failure upon fatigue or mechanical deformations. The integrated system also needs additional adhesive to strongly conform to the human skin, which can also cause irritation, alignment issues, and motion artifacts. This work introduces a skin&#8208;attachable, reprogrammable, multifunctional, adhesive device patch fabricated by simple and low&#8208;cost laser scribing of an adhesive composite with polyimide powders and amine&#8208;based ethoxylated polyethylenimine dispersed in the silicone elastomer. The obtained laser&#8208;induced graphene in the adhesive composite can be further selectively functionalized with conductive nanomaterials or enzymes for enhanced electrical conductivity or selective sensing of various sweat biomarkers. The possible combination of the sensors for real&#8208;time biofluid analysis and electrophysiological signal monitoring with RF energy harvesting and communication promises a standalone stretchable adhesive device platform based on the same material system and fabrication process.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Ionic&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Framework Fibers for Capturing of Sustainable Osmotic Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, we report that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter&#8208;long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibited power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&#8722;2 at 50&#8208;fold and 500&#8208;fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicates the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. We demonstrate a hybridization strategy synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. Our work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. We demonstrate the effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotripphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). We conduct a comprehensive mechanistic study to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. Our findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism was further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8208;analyte interactions. We also find that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies.
In this work, we&#160;show the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, we&#160;achieve enhanced optical properties and performance thanks to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows us not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of our&#160;knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT.
The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics devices.

         <title>Engineering Quantum Light Sources with Flat Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores latest development of leveraging flat&#8208;optics to generate ultra&#8208;compact quantum light sources with improved efficiency and added functionalities. It highlights photon&#8208;pair sources with nonlinear metasurfaces and single&#8208;photon emitters in 3D and 2D materials integrated with metasurfaces. The review also discusses current challenges and provide insights into the potential future directions for advancing flat&#8208;optics quantum light&#160;sources.








Abstract
Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, and precise sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift toward the utilization of &#8220;flat&#8221; optics with thickness at subwavelength scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness, scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate quantum light sources. Specifically, the generation of entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down&#8208;conversion in nonlinear metasurfaces, and single photon emission from quantum emitters including quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials are explored. The review covers theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. The diverse application range of these sources is discussed and the current challenges and perspectives in the field are&#160;highlighted.

         <title>3D Printed Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Enabled by Edible Natural Konjac Glucomannan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Shaping room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bodies is important for stereoscopic optoelectronic displays, but remains challenging due to their poor processability and mechanical properties. Here, konjac glucomannan is employed to anchor arylboronic acids with various &#960; conjugations via a facile B&#9472;O covalent reaction to afford printable inks, using which full&#8208;color high&#8208;fidelity 3D RTP objects with high mechanical strength can be obtained via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. The doubly rigid structure supplied by the synergy of hydrogen bonding and B&#9472;O covalent bonding can protect the triplet excitons, thus the prepared 3D RTP object shows a striking lifetime of 2.14 s. The printed counterparts are successfully used for 3D anti&#8208;counterfeiting and can be recycled and reprinted nondestructively by dissolving in water. This success expands the scope of printable 3D luminescent materials, providing an eco&#8208;friendly platform for the additive manufacturing of sophisticated 3D RTP architectures.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in Van Der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) spintronic devices.[1] However, studies to date have been restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (Tc) and small magnetic anisotropy.[2] Here, we developed a chemical vapor transport (CVT) method to synthesize a high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 (c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2), which boasts a high Curie temperature (Tc = 356 K) and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, we firstly observed an unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) in c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2 devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, we demonstrated the modulation of the antisymmetric MR by controlling the height of the surface steps. Our work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room&#8208;temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Metal&#8722;Organic Framework&#8208;based Materials for Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8722;organic frameworks (HOP&#8208;MOFs) possessing multi&#8208;level pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP&#8208;MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. In this review, we presented recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. We firstly introduced the synthetic strategies of HOP&#8208;MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self&#8208;assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion and nanocasting. Then the applications of HOP&#8208;MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts were summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives were emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering. Finally, the remaining scientific challenges and an outlook of this field were proposed. We hope that this review will guide the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of nanocatalysts for boosting the catalytic performance and promoting the practical applications.

         <title>Durable Perovskite Solar Cells with 24.5% Average Efficiency: the Role of Rigid Conjugated Core in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient and robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells necessitate superior organic hole&#8208;transport materials with both mechanical and electronic prowess. Deciphering the structure&#8722;property relationship of these materials is crucial for practical perovskite solar cell applications. Through direct arylation, we synthesized two high glass transition temperature molecular semiconductors, DBC&#8208;ETPA (202&#160;&#176;C) and TPE&#8208;ETPA (180&#160;&#176;C), using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenylethene (TPE) tetrabromides with triphenylene&#8211;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine (ETPA). In comparison to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, both semiconductors exhibit shallower HOMO energy levels, resulting in increased hole densities (generated by air oxidation doping) and accelerated hole extraction from photoexcited perovskite. Experimental and theoretical studies highlight the more rigid DBC core, enhancing hole mobility due to reduced reorganization energy and lower energy disorder. Importantly, DBC&#8208;ETPA possesses a higher cohesive energy density, leading to lower ion diffusion coefficients and higher Young's moduli. Leveraging these attributes, we employed DBC&#8208;ETPA as the primary hole&#8208;transport layer component, yielding perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD reference cells (24.0%). Furthermore, DBC&#8208;ETPA&#8208;based cells exhibit superior operational stability and 85&#160;&#176;C thermal storage stability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;uniform Plating of Lithium on 10&#8208;nm&#8208;scale Ordered Carbon Grids for Long Lifespan Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tailorable lithium (Li) nucleation and uniform early&#8208;stage plating is essential for long lifespan Li metal batteries. Among factors influencing the early plating of Li anode, the substrate is critical, but a fine control of the substrate structure on a scale of &#8764;10&#160;nm has been rarely achieved. Herein, we prepare a carbon consisting of ordered grids, as a model to investigate the effect of substrate structure on the Li nucleation. In contrast to the individual spherical Li nuclei formed on the flat graphene, an ultra&#8208;uniform and nuclei&#8208;free Li plating is obtained on the ordered carbon with a grid size smaller than the thermodynamical critical radius of Li nucleation (&#8764;26&#160;nm). Simultaneously, an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase is promoted by the cross&#8208;sectional carbon layers of such ordered grids which are exposed to the electrolyte. Consequently, the carbon grids with a grid size of &#8764;10&#160;nm show a favorable cycling stability for more than 1100 cycles measured at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a half cell. With LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as cathode, the assembled full cell with a cathode capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a negative/positive ratio of 1.67 demonstrates a stable cycling for over 130 cycles with a capacity retention of 88%.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Underwater Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off&#8208;grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, we address this gap by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO&#8208;4Cl, with excellent water resistance was rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well&#8208;suited to the underwater environment, the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1 m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell exceeds 7000 hours. Additionally, we fabricated a flexible OPV cell that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5 cm2 flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. Our work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off-grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, we address this gap by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO-4Cl, with excellent water resistance was rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well-suited to the underwater environment, the ITO-4Cl-based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1 m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO-4Cl-based OPV cell exceeds 7000 hours. Additionally, we fabricated a flexible OPV cell that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. Our work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Title Extraordinary Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Interaction in NbOBr2 Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are burgeoning as promising candidates for investigating nonlinear optical effects due to high nonlinear susceptibilities, broadband optical response, and tunable nonlinearity. However, most 2D materials suffer from poor nonlinear conversion efficiencies, resulting from the reduced light&#8208;matter interactions and lack of phase matching at atomic thicknesses. Herein, we report a new 2D nonlinear material, niobium oxide dibromide (NbOBr2), featuring strong and anisotropic optical nonlinearities with scalable nonlinear intensity. Furthermore, Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (F&#8208;P) microcavities are constructed by coupling NbOBr2 with air holes in silicon. Remarkable enhancement factors of approximately 630 times in second harmonic generation (SHG) and 210 times in third harmonic generation (THG) are achieved on cavity at the resonance wavelength of 1500&#160;nm. Notably, the cavity enhancement effect exhibits strong anisotropic feature tunable with pump wavelength, owing to the robust optical birefringence of NbOBr2. The ratio of the enhancement factor along the b&#8208; and c&#8208;axis of NbOBr2 reaches 2.43 and 5.27 for SHG and THG at 1500&#160;nm pump, respectively, which leads to an extraordinarily high SHG anisotropic ratio of 17.82 and a 10&#176; rotation of THG polarization. Our research presents a feasible and practical strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;power&#8208;pumped on&#8208;chip nonlinear optical devices with tunable anisotropy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly for Creating Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices with Monolayer Graphene as Chiral Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene's emergence enables creating chiral metamaterials in helical shapes for terahertz applications, overcoming material limitations. However, practical implementation remains theoretical due to fabrication challenges. This paper introduces a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly technique that enables creating vertically&#8208;aligned continuous monolayer graphene helices at microscale with great flexibility and high controllability. This assembly process not only facilitates the creation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microstructures, but also positions the 3D structures from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, achieving an aspect ratio (height/width) of approximately 2700. As a result, an array of vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices is formed, reaching up to 4&#160;mm in height, which is equivalent to 4 million times the height of monolayer graphene. The benefit of these 3D chiral structures made from graphene is their capability to infinitely extend in height, interacting with light in ways that are not possible with traditional 2D layering methods. Such an impressive height elevates a level of interaction with light that far surpasses what is achievable with traditional 2D layering methods, resulting in a notable enhancement of optical chirality properties. This approach is applicable to various 2D materials, promising advancements in innovative research and diverse applications across fields.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency of Blue Perovskite QLEDs Exceeding 23% by Trifluoroacetate Passivation and Mixed Hole Transportation Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&gt;25%) and blue film&#8208;based LEDs. Here, we present blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm, to our best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite&#8208;based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, the blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl3&#8208;xBrx QDs passivated by fluorocarboxylic acid exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, we design the device by introducing a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer (M&#8208;HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. We further find that M&#8208;HTL could decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. Our work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

         <title>Immunogenic Material Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy by Structure&#8208;dependent Immune Cell Trafficking and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inherently immunogenic materials offer enormous prospects in enhancing vaccine efficacy. However, the understanding and improving material adjuvanticity remain elusive. Herein we report how the structural presentation of immunopotentiators in a material governs the dynamic dialogue between innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced cancer vaccination. We precisely manipulate the immunopotentiator manganese into six differing structures that resemble the architectures of two types of pathogens (spherical viruses or rod&#8208;like bacteria). The results reveal that innate immune cells accurately sense and respond to the architectures, of which two outperformed material candidates (151&#160;nm hollow spheres and hollow micro&#8208;rods with an aspect ratio of 4.5) show higher competence in creating local pro&#8208;inflammatory environment with promoted innate immune cell influx and stimulatory effects on multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DCs). In combination with viral peptides, model proteins or cell lysate antigens, mature CD103+ (CD8+) DCs and CD11b+ DCs induced by the outperformed micro&#8208;rod material remarkably primes antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ and CD4+ cytolytic T cells, respectively. The micro&#8208;rod stimulates DCs with enriched gene signatures associated with plasmacytoid DC, potentially contributing to enhanced type&#8208;I interferon (IFN) mediated cellular immunity. In prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, the micro&#8208;rod adjuvanted vaccines display optimal aptitude in tumor suppression universally in four aggressive malignant murine tumor models, by promoting the infiltration of heterogeneous cytolytic effector cells while decreasing suppressive immunoregulatory populations in tumors. This study demonstrates that a rationally selected architecture of immunogenic materials potentially advances the clinical reality of cancer vaccination

         <title>Influence of Li Content on the Topological Inhibition of Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layer oxide cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, the oxygen loss during cycling limits their practical applications. Here we reveal the essential role of Li content on the topological inhibition of oxygen loss in lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials, and the relationship between the migration networks of oxygen ions with the transition metal (TM) component. Utilizing first&#8208;principles calculations in combination with percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that TM ions can effectively encage the oxidized oxygen species when the TM concentration in TM layer exceeds 5/6, thus hindering the formation of oxygen ion percolation network. This study demonstrates the significance of rational compositional design in lithium&#8208;rich cathodes for effectively suppressing irreversible oxygen release and enhancing cathode cycling performance.

         <title>Seeding Atomic Silver into Internal Lattice Sites of Transition Metal Oxide for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close&#8208;packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2, we demonstrate how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface&#8208;only loading, via which a dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice&#8208;sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub&#8208;nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual&#8208;form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol/g/h) and durability (&#8764; 48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual&#8208;form catalyst featuring facet&#8208;dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice&#8208;confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8208;substrate configuration.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, we&#160;have developed a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial that mimics the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, we&#160;have developed a permeable unit cell design that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design was&#160;simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. We&#160;have investigated principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials, identified crack closure efficiency for different crack lengths, discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, and experimentally demonstrated successful crack closure in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Luminescence, Rapid Self&#8208;Healing and Adaptive Reprogramming Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Imine Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The integration of advanced functions and diverse practical applications calls for multifunctional liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs); however, the structure&#8208;intrinsic luminescence and excellent mechanical properties of LCEs have not yet been explored. In this study, clusteroluminescence (CL)&#8208;based LCEs (CL&#8208;LCEs) were successfully fabricated without depending on large conjugated structures, thereby avoiding redundant organic synthesis and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that secondary amine (&#8211;NH&#8211;) and imine (&#8211;C = N&#8211;) groups play vital roles in determining the presence of fluorescence in CL&#8208;LCEs. Based on the above observation, the strategy universalization and a molecular library for constructing CL&#8208;LCEs were further demonstrated. Meanwhile, the dynamic bond of imine bonds endows the CL&#8208;LCE system with rapid self&#8208;healing under mild conditions (70 &#176;C in 10 min), excellent stretchability, and adaptive programmable characteristics. Furthermore, the self&#8208;luminescent performance enables visual detection of the self&#8208;healing process. Finally, CL&#8208;based information storage and anticounterfeiting were successfully realized and their applications in fiber actuators and fluorescent textiles were demonstrated. The distinctive luminescence and dynamic chemistry presented in this work has significant implications in elucidating the mechanism of CL and providing new strategies for the rational design of novel multifunctional LCE materials.

         <title>Anchored Cobalt Nanoparticles on Layered Perovskites for Rapid Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Antibiotic Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, revealing the dynamic evolution of the active sites is crucial to achieve the activity improvement and stability of the catalyst. This study reports a perovskite oxide in which atomic (Co0) in&#8208;situ embedded exsolution occurs during the high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This unique anchoring strategy significantly improves the Co3+/Co2+ cycling efficiency at the interface and inhibits metal leaching during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The Co@L&#8208;PBMC catalyst exhibited superior PMS activation ability and could achieve 99% degradation of tetracycline within 5&#160;min. The combination of experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidates that the electron&#8208;deficient oxygen vacancy accepts an electron from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in a significant electron delocalization of the Co site, thereby facilitating the adsorption of the *HSO5/*OH intermediate onto the &#8220;metal&#8208;VO bridge&#8221; structure. This work provides insights into the PMS activation mechanism at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for environmental remediation.

         <title>Boosting Formate Electrooxidation by Heterostructured PtPd Alloy and Oxides Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured PtPd alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method and demonstrated high activity towards formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the d&#8722;p orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd&#8208;ox NW. Thus, heterostructured PtPd&#8208;ox NWs achieve dual regulation of FOR thermodynamics and kinetics, exhibiting remarkable performance and demonstrating potential in practical systems.

         <title>Handedness&#8208;Inverted and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescent Nano/Micro&#8208;Materials through Pathway&#8208;Dependent Chiral Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The precise manipulation of supramolecular polymorphs has been widely applied to control the morphologies and functions of self&#8208;assemblies, but is rarely utilized for the fabrication of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with tailored properties. Here, we report that an amphiphilic naphthalene&#8208;histidine compound (NIHis) readily self&#8208;assembled into distinct chiral nanostructures through pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular polymorphism, which showed opposite and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive CPL signals. Specifically, NIHis displayed assembly&#8208;induced CPL from the polymorphic keto tautomer, which became predominant during enol&#8208;keto tautomerization shifting controlled by a bulk solvent effect. Interestingly, chiral polymorphs of nanofiber and microbelt with inverted CPL signals could be prepared from the same NIHis monomer in exactly the same solvent compositions and concentrations by only changing the temperature. The tunable CPL performance of the solid microbelts is realized under multi external physical or chemical external stimuli including grinding, acid fuming and heating. In particular, an emission color and CPL on&#8208;off switch based on the microbelt polymorph by reversible heating&#8208;cooling protocol was developed. This work brings a new approach for developing smart CPL materials via supramolecular polymorphism engineering.

Interestingly, chiral polymorphs of nanofiber and microbelt with inverted CPL signals could be prepared from the same NIHis monomer in exactly the same solvent compositions and concentrations by only changing the temperature. The tunable CPL performance of the solid microbelts is realized under multi external physical or chemical external stimuli including grinding, acid fuming and heating. In particular, an emission color and CPL on-off switch based on the microbelt polymorph by reversible heating-cooling protocol was developed. This work brings a new approach for developing smart CPL materials via supramolecular polymorphism engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gold&#8208;Template&#8208;Assisted Mechanical Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area 2D Layers Enables Efficient and Precise Construction of Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of large&#8208;area 2D monolayers or few layers, including semiconductors, superconductors, and magnets, with high production yield are successfully exfoliated by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. Various moir&#233; superlattices, including twisted homobilayers, twisted heterobilayers, and twisted multilayer superlattices, are efficiently and precisely constructed by picking&#8208;up and stacking these 2D layers using a dry&#8208;transfer method.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, consisting of rotationally aligned 2D atomically thin layers, provide a highly novel platform for the study of correlated quantum phenomena. However, reliable and efficient construction of moir&#233; superlattices is challenging because of difficulties to accurately angle&#8208;align small exfoliated 2D layers and the need to shun wet&#8208;transfer processes. Here, efficient and precise construction of various moir&#233; superlattices is demonstrated by picking up and stacking large&#8208;area 2D mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer crystals with predetermined crystal axes, made possible by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D layers are semiconductors, superconductors, or magnets and their high quality is confirmed by photoluminescence and Raman spectra and by electrical transport measurements of fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors and Hall devices. Twisted homobilayers with angle&#8208;twisting accuracy of &#8776;0.3&#176;, twisted heterobilayers with sub&#8208;degree angle&#8208;alignment accuracy, and multilayer superlattices are precisely constructed and characterized by their moir&#233; patterns, interlayer excitons, and second harmonic generation. The present study paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena in moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Synthesized Surfactant&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based NO2 Sensors: Unprecedentedly High Sensitivity and Fast Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO2 chemical sensors using aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes demonstrate unprecedently high sensitivity, ultrafast response/recovery, and low limit of detection. This is owing to the surfactant&#8208;free and high quality of the carbon nanotubes in terms of the tube diameter uniformity, tube length, bundling, and defect density. Solvent&#8208;free one&#8208;step facile lamination and industrial viability of the nanotube film is an added benefit.








Abstract
This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant&#8208;free aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. They show minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and have the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry&#8208;transferrable and facile one&#8208;step lamination results&#160;in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor shows excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500&#160;ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8&#160;s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8776;0.161&#160;ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long&#8208;term stability for longer than 6&#160;months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT&#8208;based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrate consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT&#8208;based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes with Interfacial Percolation Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial percolation network is proposed for fabricating conductive and stretchable electrodes. The 2D surface and 3D bulk conducting channels are electrically connected by a protruding AgNWs design, resulting in enhanced conductivity under large deformation with high cyclic stability.








Abstract
Stretchable electrodes are an essential component that determines the functionality and reliability of stretchable electronics, but face the challenge of balancing conductivity and stretchability. This work proposes a new conducting concept called the interfacial percolation network (PN) that results in stretchable electrodes with high conductivity, large stretchability, and high stability. The interfacial PN is composed of a 2D silver nanowires (AgNWs) PN and a protruding 3D AgNWs PN embedded on the surface and in the near&#8208;surface region of an elastic polymer matrix, respectively. The protruded PN is obtained by changing the arrangements of AgNWs from horizontal to quasi&#8208;vertical through introducing foreign polymer domains in the near&#8208;surface region of the polymer matrix. The resulting electrode achieves a conductivity of 13&#160;500 S cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of 660%. Its resistance changes under stretched conditions are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional 2D PN and 2D + 3D PN. An interfacial PN electrode made from liquid metal remained its conductivity at&#160;46&#160;750 S cm&#8722;1 after the electrode underwent multiple stretch&#8208;release cycles with a deformation of &gt;600%. The concept of interfacial PN provides fruitful implications for the design of stretchable electronics.

Abstract
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering that promoting the rearrangement of active atoms to form new structural frameworks has achieved excellent result in the field of electrocatalysis and optimized the performance of various electrochemical reactions. Herein, for the first time, we found that the different components in metallic aerogels will affect the crystal&#8208;phase transformation, especially in high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs), whose crystal&#8208;phase transformation during annealing is more difficult than medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs), but they still show better electrochemical performance. Specifically, PdPtCuCoNi HEAAs with the parent phase of face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) PdCu possess excellent 89.24% of selectivity, 746.82&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. of yield rate, and 90.75% of Faraday efficiency for ethylamine during acetonitrile reduction reaction (ARR), while maintaining stability under 50&#160;h of long&#8208;term testing and 10 consecutive electrolysis cycles. The structure&#8208;activity relationship indicates that crystal&#8208;phase regulation from amorphous state to FCC phase promotes the atomic rearrangement in HEAAs, thereby optimizing the electronic structure, and enhancing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, improving the catalytic performance. This study provides a new paradigm for developing novel ARR electrocatalysts, and also expands the potential of crystal&#8208;phase engineering in other application areas.

         <title>Observing Proton&#8211;Electron Mixed Conductivity in Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups tune the proton&#8211;electron conductivity in graphdiyne. In addition, a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence&#8208;based communication and self&#8208;nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed.








Abstract
Mixed conducting materials with both ionic and electronic conductivities have gained prominence in emerging applications. However, exploring material with on&#8208;demand ionic and electronic conductivities remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of correlating macroscopic conductivity with atom&#8208;scale structure. Here, the correlation of proton&#8211;electron conductivity and atom&#8208;scale structure in graphdiyne is explored. Precisely adjusting the conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups in graphdiyne yields a tunable proton&#8211;electron conductivity on the order of 103.

&lt;p&gt;This study reports that conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups tune the proton&#8211;electron conductivity in graphdiyne. In addition, a wet-chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. As a proof-of-concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence-based communication and self-nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed conducting materials with both ionic and electronic conductivities have gained prominence in emerging applications. However, exploring material with on-demand ionic and electronic conductivities remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of correlating macroscopic conductivity with atom-scale structure. Here, the correlation of proton&#8211;electron conductivity and atom-scale structure in graphdiyne is explored. Precisely adjusting the conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups in graphdiyne yields a tunable proton&#8211;electron conductivity on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, a wet-chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. Utilizing the proton&#8211;electron conductivity and mechanical tolerance of graphdiyne, bimodal flexible devices serving as capacitive switches and resistive sensors are created. As a proof-of-concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence-based communication and self-nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed. This work represents an important step toward understanding the atom-scale structure&#8211;conductivity relationship and extending the applications of mixed conducting materials to assistive technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. This work opens opportunities to harness straintronics effects in 2DM quantum technologies.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro&#8208;mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain can completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic&#8208;angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. The data are measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low&#8208;temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6%). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and&#160;technologies.

         <title>Water Catchers within Sub&#8208;Nano Channels Promote Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Zinc&#8208;Ion Dehydration Enable Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous material containing various water&#8208;capturing carboxyl groups within its sub&#8208;nano channels is found can facilitate the step&#8208;by&#8208;step dehydration of zinc&#8208;ions, promote the formation of an aggregative aqueous electrolyte (super&#8208;saturated), which consequently eliminate water&#8208;induced corrosion and side&#8208;reactions. More importantly, the functionalized channels can also act as ion rectifiers and promote fast but even Zn&#8208;ions transport, thus leading to a dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal.








Abstract
Zinc metal suffers from violent and long&#8208;lasting water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrollable dendritic Zn growth, which seriously reduce the coulombic efficiency (CE) and lifespan of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). To suppress the corresponding harmful effects of the highly active water, a stable zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with water catchers decorated inside its sub&#8208;nano channels is used to protect Zn&#8208;metal. Water catchers within narrow channels can constantly trap water molecules from the solvated Zn&#8208;ions and facilitate step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation/dehydration, thereby promoting the formation of an aggregative electrolyte configuration, which consequently eliminates water&#8208;induced corrosion and side reactions. More importantly, the functionalized sub&#8208;nano channels also act as ion rectifiers and promote fast but even Zn&#8208;ions transport, thereby leading to a dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal. As a result, the protected Zn metal demonstrates an unprecedented cycling stability of more than 10&#160;000 h and an ultra&#8208;high average CE of 99.92% during 4000 cycles. More inspiringly, a practical NH4V4O10//Zn pouch&#8208;cell is fabricated and delivers a capacity of 98 mAh (under high cathode mass loading of 25.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and preserves 86.2% capacity retention after 150 cycles. This new strategy in promoting highly reversible Zn metal anodes would spur the practical utilization of AZMBs.

         <title>Revealing the Indispensable Role of In Situ Electrochemically Reconstructed Mn(II)/Mn(III) in Improving the Performance of Lithium&#8208;Carbon Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work conduct comprehensive investigations into the underlying relationship between various Mn dual&#8208;active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The results reveal that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CO2 reduction and evolution reaction, respectively. These findings provide crucial insights for constructing effective cathodes by employing multivalent Mn&#8208;integrated hybrid catalysts.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy conversion and storage devices, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CORR/COER) kinetics. Due to the various crystal structures and unique electronic configuration, Mn&#8208;based cathode catalysts have shown considerable competition to facilitate CORR/COER. However, the specific active sites and regulation principle of Mn&#8208;based catalysts remain ambiguous and limited. Herein, this work designs novel Mn dual&#8208;active sites (MOC) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the underlying relationship between different Mn active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Impressively, this work finds that owing to the in situ generation and stable existence of Mn(III), MOC undergoes obvious electrochemical reconstruction during battery cycling. Moreover, a series of characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CORR and COER, respectively. Benefiting from such a modulating behavior, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries deliver a high full discharge capacity of 10.31 mAh cm&#8722;2, and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (327 cycles/1308&#160;h). This fundamental understanding of MOC reconstruction and the electrocatalytic mechanisms provides a new perspective for designing high&#8208;performance multivalent Mn&#8208;integrated hybrid catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Lignin Derived Ultra&#8208;Thin All&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes with Three dimensional Single&#8208;ion Nanofiber Ionic Bridge Framework for High Performance Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising candidates for the next generation high security and high performance batteries. Here, the lignin derived ultra&#8208;thin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#956;m, which possessed three dimensional nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin based lithium (L&#8208;Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, was obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing process. The obtained CPE presented high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, excellent oxidative stability of 4.7&#160;V, and satisfactory tensile strength of up to 9.30&#160;MPa. The Li||Li symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6500&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO4 cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles, and Li||CPE|| NCM can also stably cycle more than 70 cycles with a favorable discharge capacity of 132.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 30&#160;&#176;C. The excellent electrochemical performance was mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single&#8208;ion L&#8208;Li through electrospinning, which synergized with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient three dimensional Li+ transfer channels. Furthermore, the ultra&#8208;thin CPE can be compactly attached to the lithium anode, and provided a shorter ion transmission distance between the electrodes, inducing uniform deposition of Li+ at the interface, and inhibiting the lithium dendrites. This work provided a promising strategy to achieve ultra&#8208;thin biobased electrolytes with high tensile strength and electrochemical performance for solid&#8208;state LIBs.

This work provided a promising strategy to achieve ultra-thin biobased electrolytes with high tensile strength and electrochemical performance for solid-state LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Vacuum Thermoforming of Optically Switchable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Spherical Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are generally limited in shape, size, and quantity by the need for aligning via stretching and fixing via photopolymerizing. We present a thermoplastic LCE that may be vacuum thermoformed into centimeter&#8208;sized hemispheres. The scalable industrial process induces LCE alignment without requiring post fixing. The hemispheres display remarkable properties, actuating with strains around 20% and transitioning from opaque and scattering to highly translucent upon heating: both the physical and optical effects are fully reversible. Simulations reveal the LCE experiences biaxial strains during processing, the magnitude varying as a function of location on the hemisphere: the resulting alignment describing the hemisphere actuation well. The thermoplastic LCE hemispheres may be combined to form complete spheres by simply heating the joint. The hemisphere can also be physically deformed into a ball which can then unfold back into the hemisphere again. By doping the hemispheres with photoswitches, fluorescent or photothermal dyes, we form devices for light collection and redistribution, addressable water containers that may pour at will, and light&#8208;responsive surfing devices. This is the first example of an LCE amenable to high&#8208;volume industrial vacuum thermoforming which might lead to intricate 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) shaped actuators with new functional properties.

         <title>Rapid Selenoprotein Activation by Selenium Nanoparticles to Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis and Pathological Bone Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoclast hyperactivation stands as a significant pathological factor contributing to the emergence of bone disorders driven by heightened oxidative stress levels. The modulation of the redox balance to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) emerges as a viable approach in addressing this concern. Selenoproteins, characterized by selenocysteine (SeCys2) as the active center, are crucial for selenium&#8208;based antioxidative stress therapy for inflammatory diseases. This study reveals that surface&#8208;active elemental selenium (Se) nanoparticles, particularly those derived from lentinan (LNT&#8208;Se), exhibit enhanced cellular accumulation and accelerated metabolism to SeCys2, the primary active Se form in biological systems. Consequently, LNT&#8208;Se demonstrates significant inhibition of RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic activity when compared to alternative Se species. Furthermore, in vivo studies underscore the superior therapeutic efficacy of LNT&#8208;Se over SeCys2, potentially attributable to the enhanced stability and safety profile of LNT&#8208;Se. Specifically, LNT&#8208;Se effectively modulates the expression of the selenoprotein GPx1, thereby exerting regulatory control over macrophage polarization, osteoclast activity inhibition, and the prevention of CIA/OVX&#8208;induced osteolysis. In summary, these results suggest that the prompt activation of selenoproteins by Se nanoparticles serves to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss by upregulating GPx1 to re&#8208;polarize macrophages. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive Se species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders, with considerable potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Dynamic (Sub)surface&#8208;Oxygen Enables Highly Efficient Carbonyl&#8208;Coupling for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nowadays high&#8208;valent Cu species (i.e., Cu&#948;+) has been clarified to enhance multi&#8208;carbon production in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nonetheless, the inconsistent average Cu valence states have been reported to significantly govern the product profile of CO2RR, which may lead to misunderstanding of the enhanced mechanism for multi&#8208;carbon production and results in an ambiguous roles of high&#8208;valent Cu species. Dynamic Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR leads to erratic valence states and challenges of high&#8208;valent species determination. Herein, we propose an alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface&#8208;oxygenated degree (&#954;) to quantify the active high&#8208;valent Cu species on the (sub)surface, which regulates the multi&#8208;carbon production of CO2RR. The &#954; validates a strong correlation to the carbonyl (*CO) coupling efficiency and is the critical factor for the multi&#8208;carbon enhancement, in which an optimized Cu2O@Pd2.31 achieves the multi&#8208;carbon partial current density of &#8764;330 mA cm&#8722;2 with a faradaic efficiency of 83.5%. This work shows a promising way to unveil the role of high&#8208;valent species and further achieve carbon neutralization.

         <title>High Hydrogen Storage in Trigonal Prismatic Monomer&#8208;based Highly Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen storage is crucial in the shift toward a carbon&#8208;neutral society, where hydrogen serves as a pivotal renewable energy source. Utilizing porous materials can provide an efficient hydrogen storage solution, reducing tank pressures to manageable levels and circumventing the energy&#8208;intensive and costly current technological infrastructure. Herein, we report two highly porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), C&#8208;PAF and Si&#8208;PAF, prepared through a Yamamoto C&#8208;C coupling reaction between trigonal prismatic monomers. These PAFs exhibited large pore volumes and BET areas, 3.93 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 4857 m2 g&#8722;1 for C&#8208;PAF, and 3.80 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 6099 m2 g&#8722;1 for Si&#8208;PAF, respectively. Si&#8208;PAF exhibited a record&#8208;high gravimetric hydrogen delivery capacity of 17.01 wt% and a superior volumetric capacity of 46.5&#160;g L&#8722;1 under pressure&#8208;temperature swing adsorption conditions (77 K, 100&#160;bar &#8594; 160 K, 5&#160;bar), outperforming benchmark hydrogens storage materials. By virtue of the robust C&#8208;C covalent bond, both PAFs showed impressive structural stabilities in harsh environments and unprecedented long&#8208;term durability. Computational modeling methods were employed to simulate and investigate the structural and adsorption properties of the PAFs. These results demonstrate that C&#8208;PAF and Si&#8208;PAF are promising materials for efficient hydrogen storage.

Abstract
Artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in&#8208;memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, we present Li&#8208;ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2 under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V. Postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as built&#8208;in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices. The setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow was employed to drive the photoisomerization process of photochromic molecules that mimic neurotransmitter transfer in human brain for realizing a key memory rule, i.e., the transition from long&#8208;term memory to permanent memory. The combination of setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow with photodiode amplifiers is also processed to emulate the human responding action after setting&#8208;training process. Overall, we demonstrate the successful integration in neuromorphic computing comprising stimulus judgment, photon emission, transition, and encoding, thereby exploiting these artificial multifunctional devices to emulate the complicated decision tree of human brain.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in-memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, we present Li-ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light-emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000 cd&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V. Postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as built-in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices.

         <title>The Impact of Local Strain Fields in Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnetic Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for &#8220;beyond von Neumann&#8221; computing applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One such group are the non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the material is synthesised in thin film form and attributed to symmetry&#8208;breaking caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction or from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as magnetisation and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by examining non&#8208;collinear films that are either highly lattice mismatched or closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks are generated and for the former case these extend throughout the entire film thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for finite intrinsic magnetisation in seemly structurally relaxed films and influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non&#8208;relativistic, momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin&#8208;splitting are documented within the framework of the non&#8208;relativistic spin group symmetry, there is limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin&#8208;splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, &#945;&#8722;MnTe. Employing temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, we elucidate the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature&#8208;dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin&#8208;splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in &#945;&#8722;MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.

         <title>Synergizing Fe2O3 nanoparticles on single atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for nitrate reduction to ammonia at industrial current densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen species enables a pathway for the carbon neutral synthesis of ammonia (NH3). The most oxidized form of nitrogen, nitrate (NO3&#8722;) can be reduced to NH3 via the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost&#8208;competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, we leverage the high NO3RR activity of Fe&#8208;based materials to synthesize a novel active particle&#8208;active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C. By synergizing the activity of both nanoparticles and single atom sites, the optimized 3xFe2O3/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9&#160;mmol hr&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (at &#8208;1.2&#160;V versus RHE). In&#8208;situ XANES and post&#8208;mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis, to realize the ultrahigh NO3RR activity. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe&#8208;Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8208;1.3 A cm&#8722;2 over 24 hours, a near unity FENH3 (at &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus RHE). This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle&#8208;active support system enhancing the performance of the NO3RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.

         <title>Breaking the pH Limitation of Nanozymes: Mechanisms, Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although nanozymes have drawn a great attention over the past decade, the activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are often pH dependent with elusive mechanism, which largely restricts their application. Therefore, a systematical discussion on the pH related catalytic mechanisms of nanozymes together with the methods to overcome this limitation is in need. In this review, various nanozymes exhibiting pH dependent catalytic activities are collected and the root causes for their pH dependence are comprehensively analyzed. Subsequently, regulatory concepts including catalytic environment reconstruction and direct catalytic activity improvement to break this pH restriction are summarized. Moreover, applications of pH independent nanozymes in sensing, disease therapy and pollutant degradation are overviewed. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities on the development of pH independent nanozymes are suggested. It is anticipated that this review will promote the further design of pH independent nanozymes and broaden their application range with higher efficiency.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Compatible Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Composite Barrier as Low&#8208;Voltage and Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Speed Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a sub&#8208;nanosecond switching speed of 500&#160;ps is demonstrated in HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier. The memristors show a low write current density, long retention, high endurance, 8 discrete and 128 gradually tunable conductance states, promising for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memories and memristive synapses.








Abstract
The big data era requires ultrafast, low&#8208;power, and silicon&#8208;compatible materials and devices for information storage and processing. Here, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) based on SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier and both conducting electrodes are designed and fabricated on Si substrates. The FTJ achieves the fastest write speed of 500&#160;ps under 5&#160;V (2 orders of magnitude faster than reported silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs) or 10&#160;ns speed at a low voltage of 1.5&#160;V (the lowest voltage among FTJs at similar speeds), low write current density of 1.3 &#215; 104 A cm&#8722;2, 8 discrete states, good retention &gt;&#160;105 s at 85&#160;&#176;C, and endurance &gt;&#160;107. In addition, it provides a large read current (88 A cm&#8722;2) at 0.1&#160;V, 2 orders of magnitude larger than reported FTJs. Interestingly, in FTJ&#8208;based synapses, gradually tunable conductance states (128 states) with high linearity (&lt;1) are obtained by 10&#160;ns pulses of &lt;1.2&#160;V, and a high accuracy of 91.8% in recognizing fashion product images is achieved by online neural network simulations. These results highlight that silicon&#8208;compatible HfO2&#8208;based FTJs are promising for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories and electrical synapses.

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, a sub-nanosecond switching speed of 500&#160;ps is demonstrated in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions with a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite barrier. The memristors show a low write current density, long retention, high endurance, 8 discrete and 128 gradually tunable conductance states, promising for next-generation nonvolatile memories and memristive synapses.

         <title>A Hybrid Nanoadjuvant Simultaneously Depresses PD&#8208;L1/TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and Activates cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Overcome Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Resistance</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation and activing the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to reverse tumor hypoxia and impair DNA damage repair. This Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb system effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects.








Abstract
Currently, certain cancer patients exhibit resistance to radiotherapy due to reduced DNA damage under hypoxic conditions and acquired immune tolerance triggered by transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) and membrane&#8208;localized programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1). Meanwhile, cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 induces radiotherapy resistance through accelerating DNA damage repair (DDR). However, the disability of clinically used PD&#8208;L1 antibodies in inhibiting cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 limits their effectiveness. Therefore, a nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer to radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation through depressing PD&#8208;L1 and TGF&#8208;&#946;1 by triphenylphosphine&#8208;derived metformin, and activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by generating Mn2+ from MnO2 and producing more dsDNA via reversing tumor hypoxia and impairing DDR. Thus, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects. Overall, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb has the potential to be clinically applied for overcoming radio&#8208;immunotherapy resistance.

         <title>An On&#8208;Demand Collaborative Innate&#8211;Adaptive Immune Response to Infection Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrophages play crucial roles in bridging both host innate and adaptive anti&#8208;infectious immunity while their intrinsic bactericidal function is compromised with prolonged infection progressing. After in situ nanoparticle arming, macrophages in infection sites demonstrate substantially augmented antimicrobial activities and also facilitate the reversal of the immunosuppressive microenvironment, which thus realizes infection control and recurrence prevention in an on&#8208;demand manner.








Abstract
Deep tissue infection is a common clinical issue and therapeutic difficulty caused by the disruption of the host antibacterial immune function, resulting in treatment failure and infection relapse. Intracellular pathogens are refractory to elimination and can manipulate host cell biology even after appropriate treatment, resulting in a locoregional immunosuppressive state that leads to an inadequate response to conventional anti&#8208;infective therapies. Here, a novel antibacterial strategy involving autogenous immunity using a biomimetic nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based regulating system is reported to induce in&#160;situ collaborative innate&#8211;adaptive immune responses. It is observed that a macrophage membrane coating facilitates NP enrichment at the infection site, followed by active NP accumulation in macrophages in a mannose&#8208;dependent manner. These NP&#8208;armed macrophages exhibit considerably improved innate capabilities, including more efficient intracellular ROS generation and pro&#8208;inflammatory factor secretion, M1 phenotype promotion, and effective eradication of invasive bacteria. Furthermore, the reprogrammed macrophages direct T cell activation at infectious sites, resulting in a robust adaptive antimicrobial immune response to ultimately achieve bacterial clearance and prevent infection relapse. Overall, these results provide a conceptual framework for a novel macrophage&#8208;based strategy for infection treatment via the regulation of autogenous immunity.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity of Fe3GeTe2 Crystal with Native Heterostructure for Ultraviolet to Terahertz Ultra&#8208;Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing negative photoconductivity effect in Fe3GeTe2 9crystal with native heterostructure is first reported. The resulting ferromagnetic&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature photodetector exhibits excellent responsivity of 103&#8211;100&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 level and ultra&#8208;broadband detection range covering UV&#8211;vis&#8208;IR&#8208;THz band. It surpasses most broad&#8208;spectrum photodetectors and offers the opportunity for Fe3GeTe2 materials in spin optoelectronics with ultra&#8208;low power consumption.








Abstract
Gaining insight into the photoelectric behavior of ferromagnetic materials is significant for comprehensively grasping their intrinsic properties and broadening future application fields. Here, through a specially designed Fe3GeTe2/O&#8208;Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure, first, the broad&#8208;spectrum negative photoconductivity phenomenon of ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe3GeTe2 is reported that covers UV&#8211;vis&#8208;infrared&#8208;terahertz bands (355&#160;nm to 3000&#160;&#181;m), promising to compensate for the inadequacies of traditional optoelectronic devices. The significant suppression of photoexcitation conductivity is revealed to arise from the semimetal/oxidation (sMO) interface&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;response mechanism, in which the electron excitation origins from the semiconductor photoconductivity effect in high&#8208;energy photon region, and semimetal topological band&#8208;transition in low&#8208;energy photon region. High responsivities ranging from 103 to 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 are acquired within ultraviolet&#8208;terahertz bands under &#177;0.1&#160;V bias voltage at room temperature. Notably, the responsivity of 2.572 A W&#8722;1 at 3000&#160;&#181;m (0.1 THz) and the low noise equivalent power of 26 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 surpass most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mainstream terahertz detectors. This research provides a new perspective for revealing the photoelectric conversion properties of Fe3GeTe2 crystal and paves the way for the development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance perfluorosulfonic acid proton exchange membranes (PEM) &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; with its own nanofibers are prepared, thereby the interfacial compatibility issue of traditional composite materials is perfectly addressed, as a result of orientation of molecular and ion clusters, ultrahigh proton conductivity exceeding 1&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, high strength and low swelling are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is crucial for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, a novel &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM is fabricated for the first time, which is composed of perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) resin and its own nanofibers as reinforcement. With this strategy, the interfacial compatibility issue of conventional fiber&#8208;reinforced membranes is fully addressed and up to 80 wt% loading of PFSA nanofibers can be incorporated. Furthermore, on account of chain orientation within the PFSA nanofiber, single fiber exhibits super&#8208;high conductivity of 1.45 S cm&#8722;1, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton conductivity (1.1 S cm&#8722;1) of the as&#8208;prepared &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM so far, which is an order of magnitude increase compared with the bulk PFSA membrane (0.29 S cm&#8722;1). It surpasses any commercial PEM including the popular GORE&#8208;SELECT and Nafion HP membranes and is the only PEM with conductivity at 100 S cm&#8722;1 level. In addition, the mechanical strength and swelling ratio of membranes are both substantially improved simultaneously. Based on the high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM, high peak power densities of up to 3.6&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and 1.7&#160;W cm&#8722;2 are achieved in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;Air fuel cells, respectively. This strategy can be applied in any polymeric electrolyte membrane.

         <title>Dynamic Behavior of Spatially Confined Sn Clusters and Its Application in Highly Efficient Sodium Storage with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers during sodiation and desodiation is revealed. The deep learning&#8208;assisted 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique of CNFs reveals the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters even after desodiation and the remaining pore connectivity despite cluster expansion and solid electrolyte interface formation.








Abstract
Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built&#8208;in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofiber) during sodiation and desodiation is revealed using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm pores. Taking advantage of the built&#8208;in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer&#8208;sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8776;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&#8722;1) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%. The findings provide insights into electrochemical reactions in a confined space and a guiding principle in electrode design for battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built-in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro- and nano-particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofiber) during sodiation and desodiation is revealed using a state-of-the-art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub-2-nm pores. Taking advantage of the built-in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer-sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8776;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrogel with Ultra&#8208;Rapid Cell&#8208;Mediated Network Adaptation for Enhancing Cellular Metabolic Energetics and Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors successfully fabricate an HA&#8208;ADA hydrogel based on CD&#8208;ADA crosslinks. This hydrogel has more dynamic properties, facilitating spreading and cell&#8211;cell interactions of encapsulated cells and promoting fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The enhanced ATP generation promotes human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and further accelerates bone regeneration.









Abstract
Cellular energetics plays an important role in tissue regeneration, and the enhanced metabolic activity of delivered stem cells can accelerate tissue repair and regeneration. However, conventional hydrogels with limited network cell adaptability restrict cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell metabolic activities. In this work, it is shown that a cell&#8208;adaptable hydrogel with high network dynamics enhances the glucose uptake and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) compared with a hydrogel with low network dynamics. It is further shown that the hMSCs encapsulated in the high dynamic hydrogels exhibit increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA)&#160;cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biosynthesis via an E&#8208;cadherin&#8208; and AMP&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK)&#8208;dependent mechanism. The in vivo evaluation further showed that the delivery of MSCs by the dynamic hydrogel enhanced in situ bone regeneration in an animal model. It is believed that the findings provide critical insights into the impact of stem cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions on cellular metabolic energetics and the underlying mechanisms.

         <title>Self&#8208;Disassembling and Oxygen&#8208;Generating Porphyrin&#8208;Lipoprotein Nanoparticle for Targeted Glioblastoma Resection and Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>

Porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) help realize the targeted accumulation, enhance porphyrin&#8208;lipid fluorescence, and boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoplatform enables precise fluorescence&#8208;guided GBM resection and enhances the post&#8208;operative PDT effect via real&#8208;time tumor fluorescence imaging and an ameliorated hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Created by BioRender.com.








Abstract
The dismal prognosis for glioblastoma multiform (GBM) patients is primarily attributed to the highly invasive tumor residual that remained after surgical intervention. The development of precise intraoperative imaging and postoperative residual removal techniques will facilitate the gross total elimination of GBM. Here, a self&#8208;disassembling porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) is developed to target GBM via macropinocytosis, allowing for fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery of GBM and improving photodynamic treatment (PDT) of GBM residual by alleviating hypoxia. By reducing self&#8208;quenching and enhancing lysosome escape efficiency, the incorporation of calcium peroxide (CaO2) cores in PLCNP amplifies the fluorescence intensity of porphyrin&#8208;lipid. Furthermore, the CaO2 core has diminished tumor hypoxia and improves the PDT efficacy of PLCNP, enabling low&#8208;dose PDT and reversing tumor progression induced by hypoxia aggravation following PDT. Taken together, this self&#8208;disassembling and oxygen&#8208;generating porphyrin&#8208;lipoprotein nanoparticle may serve as a promising all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanotheranostic platform for guiding precise GBM excision and empowering post&#8208;operative PDT, providing a clinically applicable strategy to combat GBM in a safe and effective manner.

         <title>Chlorella&#8208;Loaded Antibacterial Microneedles for Microacupuncture Oxygen Therapy of Diabetic Bacterial Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed. The PILMN&#8208;Chl combines the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, the sterilization activities of PIL, and the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles to effectively accelerate bacteria infected diabetic chronic wounds healing in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief of the wounds in a two&#8208;pronged manner.








Abstract
Hypoxia and infection are urgent clinical problems in chronic diabetic wounds. Herein, living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed for microacupuncture oxygen and antibacterial therapy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected chronic diabetic wounds. The PILMN&#8208;Chl can stably and continuously produce oxygen for more than 30&#160;h due to the photosynthesis of the loaded self&#8208;supported Chlorella. By combining the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles, the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, and the sterilization activities of PIL, the PILMN&#8208;Chl can accelerate chronic diabetic wounds in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief in deep parts of wounds. Thus, the self&#8208;oxygen produced microneedles modality may provide a promising and facile therapeutic strategy for treating chronic, hypoxic, and infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Sr4Al2O7: A New Sacrificial Layer with High Water Dissolution Rate for the Synthesis of Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sacrificial layer, Sr4Al2O7, is proposed to fabricate freestanding oxide membranes with high water dissolution rate, which is &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely attributed to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in its crystal structure.








Abstract
Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes have drawn great attention recently since they offer exceptional structural tunability and stacking ability, providing new opportunities in fundamental research and potential device applications in silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technology. Among different types of sacrificial layers, the (Ca, Sr, Ba)3Al2O6 compounds are most widely used since they can be dissolved in water and prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite oxide membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces; However, the typical transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter&#8208;size freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer&#8208;scale samples with high yield. Here, a new member of the SrO&#8208;Al2O3 family, Sr4Al2O7 is introduced, and its high dissolution rate, &#8776;10 times higher than that of Sr3Al2O6 is demonstrated. The high&#8208;dissolution&#8208;rate of Sr4Al2O7 is most likely related to the more discrete Al&#8208;O networks and higher concentration of water&#8208;soluble Sr&#8208;O species in this compound. This work significantly facilitates the preparation of freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.

         <title>Ultrathin, Transferred Layers of Silicon Oxynitrides as Tunable Biofluid Barriers for Bioresorbable Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride) that can be formed in thin films as stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to biologically and environmentally benign end products. These ultrathin, transferred inorganic layers enable the stable operation of partially biodegradable wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes over extended periods in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Bio/ecoresorbable electronic systems create unique opportunities in implantable medical devices that serve a need over a finite time period and then disappear naturally to eliminate the need for extraction surgeries. A critical challenge in the development of this type of technology is in materials that can serve as thin, stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to benign end products. This paper describes a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride, SiON) that can be formed in thin films by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition for this purpose. In vitro studies suggest that SiON and its dissolution products are biocompatible, indicating the potential for its use in implantable devices. A facile process to fabricate flexible, wafer&#8208;scale multilayer films bypasses limitations associated with the mechanical fragility of inorganic thin films. Systematic computational, analytical, and experimental studies highlight the essential materials aspects. Demonstrations in wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes both in vitro and in vivo illustrate the practical use of these materials strategies. The ability to select degradation rates and water permeability through fine tuning of chemical compositions and thicknesses provides the opportunity to obtain a range of functional lifetimes to meet different application requirements.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Flexible and High&#8208;Performing Thermoelectrics by Direct Laser Printing on Plastic Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalistic route to additively manufacture, via laser printing, ultra&#8208;flexible and high&#8208;performing Bi2Te3 films (power factor over 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2) directly on plastic foil is developed. This route facilitates large&#8208;area fabrication and complex maskless patterning without organic binders and leads to the innovative concept of &#8220;cuttable power arrays&#8221; that enable the fast customization of thermoelectric generators for diverse applications.








Abstract
The emerging fields of wearables and the Internet of Things introduce the need for electronics and power sources with unconventional form factors: large area, customizable shape, and flexibility. Thermoelectric (TE) generators can power those systems by converting abundant waste heat into electricity, whereas the versatility of additive manufacturing suits heterogeneous form factors. Here, additive manufacturing of high&#8208;performing flexible TEs is proposed. Maskless and large&#8208;area patterning of Bi2Te3&#8208;based films is performed by laser powder bed fusion directly on plastic foil. Mechanical interlocking allows simultaneous patterning, sintering, and attachment of the films to the substrate without using organic binders that jeopardize the final performance. Material waste could be minimized by recycling the unexposed powder. The particular microstructure of the laser&#8208;printed material renders the&#8212;otherwise brittle&#8212;Bi2Te3 films highly flexible despite their high thickness. The films survive 500 extreme&#8208;bending cycles to a 0.76&#160;mm radius. Power factors above 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;low sheet resistance for flexible TEs of 0.4 &#937; sq&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to unprecedented potential for power generation. This versatile fabrication route enables innovative implementations, such as cuttable arrays adapting to specific applications in&#160;self&#8208;powered sensing, and energy harvesting from unusual scenarios like human skin and curved hot surfaces.

         <title>Self&#8208;Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a self&#8208;heating multistage microneedle patch is reported. It presents a multilevel structure including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release (5&#8208;FU/HA), a degradable tip for sustained drug release (thymoquinone/Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)), and a substrate filled with self&#8208;heating material (Fe power mixture). Such self&#8208;heating microneedle patch is very promising for the high&#8208;efficient topical therapy of skin cancer.








Abstract
Topical therapy is a favored route for treating skin cancers, but remain many challenges, such as low delivery efficiency, limited tumor tissue penetration, and unsatisfactory blood circulation. Here, a self&#8208;heating microneedle (MN) patch with multilevel structures, including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release, a degradable tip for sustained drug release, and a self&#8208;heating substrate is described. The thermally enhanced drug release performance is validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. High tumor therapeutic efficacy can be achieved due to the rapid release of 5&#8208;fluorouracil, while the sustained release of thymoquinone endows the MN patch with long&#8208;term tumor inhibition ability. It is further demonstrated the feasibility of such an MN patch for in vivo topical therapy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with high efficacy, low side effects, and long&#8208;term inhibition of recurrence.

     alt="Self-Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a self-heating multistage microneedle patch is reported. It presents a multilevel structure including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release (5-FU/HA), a degradable tip for sustained drug release (thymoquinone/Poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid)), and a substrate filled with self-heating material (Fe power mixture). Such self-heating microneedle patch is very promising for the high-efficient topical therapy of skin cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topical therapy is a favored route for treating skin cancers, but remain many challenges, such as low delivery efficiency, limited tumor tissue penetration, and unsatisfactory blood circulation. Here, a self-heating microneedle (MN) patch with multilevel structures, including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release, a degradable tip for sustained drug release, and a self-heating substrate is described. The thermally enhanced drug release performance is validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. High tumor therapeutic efficacy can be achieved due to the rapid release of 5-fluorouracil, while the sustained release of thymoquinone endows the MN patch with long-term tumor inhibition ability. It is further demonstrated the feasibility of such an MN patch for in vivo topical therapy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with high efficacy, low side effects, and long-term inhibition of recurrence. This self-heating MN patch holds great promise for potential clinical applications, especially for the treatment of skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in a Chemically Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced topological Hall effect (up to 1.92 &#181;&#937; cm) is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy film across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. Distinct from that observed in the skyrmion systems and geometrically frustrated magnets, this effect is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by spin frustration under the magnetic field.








Abstract
The topological Hall effect (THE) is the transport response of chiral spin textures and thus can serve as a powerful probe for detecting and understanding these unconventional magnetic orders. So far, the THE is only observed in either noncentrosymmetric systems where spin chirality is stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions, or triangular&#8208;lattice magnets with Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida&#8208;type interactions. Here, a pronounced THE is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy with a simple face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The alloy is shown to have a strong magnetic frustration owing to the random occupation of magnetic atoms on the close&#8208;packed fcc lattice and the direct Heisenberg exchange interaction among atoms, as evidenced by the appearance of a reentrant spin glass state in the low&#8208;temperature regime and the first principles calculations. Consequently, THE is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by strong spin frustration under the external magnetic field, which is distinct from the mechanism responsible for the skyrmion systems, as well as geometrically frustrated magnets.

         <title>Injectable Self&#8208;Expanding/Self&#8208;Propelling Hydrogel Adhesive with Procoagulant Activity and Rapid Gelation for Lethal Massive Hemorrhage Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable antibacterial hydrogels with self&#8208;expanding/self&#8208;propelling, wet tissue adhesiveness, procoagulant activity, and rapid gelation are prepared based on CO2 foaming and Schiff base crosslinking. Due to the combination of efficient coagulation, plugging of bleeding site, and tissue adhesiveness, the hydrogel is effective in stopping fatal massive and/or noncompressible hemorrhages on wet tissue surfaces, at the extremity junctions and at the torso.








Abstract
Developing hydrogels that can quickly reach deep bleeding sites, adhere to wounds, and expand to stop lethal and/or noncompressible bleeding in civil and battlefield environments remains a challenge. Herein, an injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel bioadhesive with procoagulant activity and rapid gelation is reported. This hydrogel combines spontaneous gas foaming and rapid Schiff base crosslinking for lethal massive hemorrhage. Hydrogels have rapid gelation and expansion rate, high self&#8208;expanding ratio, excellent antibacterial activity, antioxidant efficiency, and tissue adhesion capacity. In addition, hydrogels have good cytocompatibility, procoagulant ability, and higher blood cell/platelet adhesion activity than commercial combat gauze and gelatin sponge. The optimized hydrogel (OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30) exhibits better hemostatic ability than combat gauze and gelatin sponge in rat liver and femoral artery bleeding models, rabbit volumetric liver loss massive bleeding models with/without anticoagulant, and rabbit liver and kidney incision bleeding models with bleeding site not visible. Especially, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 rapidly stops the bleedings from pelvic area of rabbit, and swine subclavian artery vein transection. Furthermore, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 has biodegradability and biocompatibility, and accelerates Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected skin wound healing. This injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel opens up a new avenue to develop hemostats for lethal massive bleeding, abdominal organ bleeding, and bleeding from coagulation lesions.

         <title>Highly Ordered Eutectic Mesostructures via Template&#8208;Directed Solidification within Thermally Engineered Templates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template thermal engineering greatly enhances long&#8208;range order of mesostructures formed by template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly. Employing porous Si rods as a template (thermal conductivity &#8776;0.28 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1, thermal diffusivity &#8776;0.89 mm2/s) nearly perfect periodic microstructures with optical properties matching simulations result. In distinct contrast, when the thermal diffusivity of the template is much greater, only disordered structures are formed.








Abstract
Template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of solidifying eutectics results in emergence of unique microstructures due to diffusion constraints and thermal gradients imposed by the template. Here, the importance of selecting the template material based on its conductivity to control heat transfer between the template and the solidifying eutectic, and thus the thermal gradients near the solidification front, is demonstrated. Simulations elucidate the relationship between the thermal properties of the eutectic and template and the resultant microstructure. The overarching finding is that templates with low thermal conductivities are generally advantageous for forming highly organized microstructures. When electrochemically porosified silicon pillars (thermal conductivity &lt; 0.3 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are used as the template into which an AgCl&#8208;KCl eutectic is solidified, 99% of the unit cells in the solidified structure exhibit the same pattern. In contrast, when higher thermal conductivity crystalline silicon pillars (&#8776;100 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are utilized, the expected pattern is only present in 50% of the unit cells. The thermally engineered template results in mesostructures with tunable optical properties and reflectances nearly identical to the simulated reflectances of perfect structures, indicating highly ordered patterns are formed over large areas. This work highlights the importance of controlling heat flows in template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of eutectics.

         <title>Rapid Generation of hPSC&#8208;Derived High Endothelial Venule Organoids with In Vivo Ectopic Lymphoid Tissue Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to control, enhance, or restrain the immune reactivity of T cells are desirable for immune disorders and anti&#8208;tumor therapies. This study presents a fast method for the generation of synthetic lymph nodes (named HEVOs) from human pluripotent stem cells, which can be implanted to control the activity of T cells locally, for example, against tumors.








Abstract
Bioengineering strategies for the fabrication of implantable lymphoid structures mimicking lymph nodes (LNs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) could amplify the adaptive immune response for therapeutic applications such as cancer immunotherapy. No method to date has resulted in the consistent formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which is the specialized vasculature responsible for na&#239;ve T cell recruitment and education in both LNs and TLS. Here orthogonal induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells carrying a regulatable ETV2 allele is used to rapidly and efficiently induce endothelial differentiation. Assembly of embryoid bodies combining primitive inducible endothelial cells and primary human LN fibroblastic reticular cells results in the formation of HEV&#8208;like structures that can aggregate into 3D organoids (HEVOs). Upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, HEVOs successfully engraft and form lymphatic structures that recruit both antigen&#8208;presenting cells and adoptively&#8208;transferred lymphocytes, therefore displaying basic TLS capabilities. The results further show that functionally, HEVOs can organize an immune response and promote anti&#8208;tumor activity by adoptively&#8208;transferred T lymphocytes. Collectively, the experimental approaches represent an innovative and scalable proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy for the fabrication of bioengineered TLS that can be deployed in vivo to enhance adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Validating Operating Stability and Biocompatibility Toward Safer&#160;Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PAM hydrogel electrolyte with slippage&#8208;free electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface and superior moisture maintaining ability is designed to ensure the operating stability of biocompatible zinc&#8208;based batteries. The impacts from batteries on body are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations, which demonstrate the high biosecurity.








Abstract
Wearable and implantable electronics are standing at the frontiers of science and technology, driven by the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles. Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) are regarded as ideal energy suppliers for these biocompatible electronics, but the corresponding biocompatibility validation is still in the initial stage. Meanwhile, complicated working conditions and some extreme electrolyte environments raise strict challenges, leaving less choices for safe ZBs. Toward higher operating stability and biocompatibility, this work proposes a hydrogel electrolyte featuring the moisture maintaining ability and a robust interface, which could further provide a milder environment for Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries and Zn&#8208;air batteries. The cytotoxicity and tissue injury of batteries are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations on the animal models, which demonstrate the high biocompatibility&#160;of ZBs, while preliminary wearable devices implementation further verifies their operating stability. This work may provide a pathway for developing and validating biocompatible ZBs, contributing to their future practical employment in relevant fields.

         <title>A Journey of Challenges and Victories: A Bibliometric Worldview of Nanomedicine since the 21st Century</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meticulous and extensive bibliometric analysis of nanomedicine publications over a 23&#8208;year period (2000&#8208;2023) is presented. This study covers publication trends, research powers, keywords, references, subject classifications, research themes, and journals. This investigation reveals the field's evolution, current state, frontiers, and emerging trends. Valuable insights will inspire researchers in diverse industries, enriching their refined comprehension of nanomedicine research.








Abstract
Nanotechnology profoundly affects the advancement of medicine. Limitations in diagnosing and treating cancer and chronic diseases promote the growth of nanomedicine. However, there are very few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from first January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.

         <title>Tunable Adhesion for All&#8208;Dry Transfer of 2D Materials Enabled by the Freezing of Transfer Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by freezing the transfer medium to induce the crosslinking of polymer chains, the adhesion is successfully tuned between graphene and polymer for wafer&#8208;scale all&#8208;dry of graphene and MoS2 onto various substrates, compatible with industrial production for future applications.








Abstract
The real applications of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown graphene films require the reliable techniques for transferring graphene from growth substrates onto application&#8208;specific substrates. The transfer approaches that avoid the use of organic solvents, etchants, and strong bases are compatible with industrial batch processing, in which graphene transfer should be conducted by dry exfoliation and lamination. However, all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene remains unachievable owing to the difficulty in precisely controlling interfacial adhesion to enable the crack&#8208; and contamination&#8208;free transfer. Herein, through controllable crosslinking of transfer medium polymer, the adhesion is successfully tuned between the polymer and graphene for all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene wafers. Stronger adhesion enables crack&#8208;free peeling of the graphene from growth substrates, while reduced adhesion facilitates the exfoliation of polymer from graphene surface leaving an ultraclean surface. This work provides an industrially compatible approach for transferring 2D materials, key for their future applications, and offers a route for tuning the interfacial adhesion that would allow for the transfer&#8208;enabled fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Tunable 2D Electron&#8208; and 2D Hole States Observed at Fe/SrTiO3 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to tuning the carrier character of a Fe/SrTiO3 interface is the oxidation state of the Fe overlayer. For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208;derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, a 2D electron system is formed.








Abstract
Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of carriers&#8212;either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged holes. Here, direct evidence for individually emerging n&#8208; or p&#8208;type 2D band dispersions in STO&#8208;based heterostructures is provided using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of an adjacent Fe&#8208;based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208; derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, an 2D electron system is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole&#8208;type interfaces, which as of yet had&#160;been exclusively assigned to the emergence of 2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a redox overlayer. This will extend the spectrum of phenomena in oxide electronics, including the realization of combined n/p&#8208;type all&#8208;oxide transistors or logic&#160;gates.

         <title>Fast Kinetics Design for Solid&#8208;State Battery Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leap of full cell kinetics at high cathode loading and areal capacity is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. The design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and with a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C.








Abstract
Fast kinetics of solid&#8208;state batteries at the device level is not adequately explored to achieve fast charging and discharging. In this work, a leap forward is achieved for fast kinetics in full cells with high cathode loading and areal capacity. This kinetic improvement is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. In the cathode, the authors&#8217; design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 to be stably cycled at high current densities of &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, yielding a C&#8208;rate from 5 to 10 C. In the anode, the authors&#8217; design breaks the common rule of the negative correlation between critical C&#8208;rate and the discharge voltage that is observed in most other anodes. The overall design enables the fast cycling of such batteries for over 4000 cycles at room temperature and 5 C charge&#8208;rate.

     alt="Fast Kinetics Design for Solid-State Battery Device"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leap of full cell kinetics at high cathode loading and areal capacity is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. The design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to be stably cycled at &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and with a C-rate from 5 to 10 C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast kinetics of solid-state batteries at the device level is not adequately explored to achieve fast charging and discharging. In this work, a leap forward is achieved for fast kinetics in full cells with high cathode loading and areal capacity. This kinetic improvement is achieved by designing a hierarchical structure of electrode composites. In the cathode, the authors&#8217; design enables high areal capacities above 3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to be stably cycled at high current densities of &#8776;13&#8211;40&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, yielding a C-rate from 5 to 10 C. In the anode, the authors&#8217; design breaks the common rule of the negative correlation between critical C-rate and the discharge voltage that is observed in most other anodes. The overall design enables the fast cycling of such batteries for over 4000 cycles at room temperature and 5 C charge-rate. The design principles unveiled by this work help to understand critical kinetic processes in battery devices that limit the fast cycling at high cathode loading and speed up the design of high-performance solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Ultra&#8208;Shallow Near&#8208;Edge States for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient doping of hybrid perovskites holds the potential to further advance solar cell efficiency. This study presents a generic strategy for perovskite doping by constructing ultra&#8208;shallow near&#8208;edge states. These states can effectively prolong electron&#8208;hole recombination through efficient trap and de&#8208;trap processes, resulting in over 25% efficiency in inverted perovskite solar cells with superior long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Electronic band structure engineering of metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHP) lies at the core of fundamental materials research and photovoltaic applications. However, reconfiguring the band structures in MHP for optimized electronic properties remains challenging. This article reports a generic strategy for constructing near&#8208;edge states to improve carrier properties, leading to enhanced device performances. The near&#8208;edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli&#8208;electron volts by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near&#8208;edge states in positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative inverted cells, a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07&#8208;cm2 cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1&#8208;cm2 cell is achieved. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.

         <title>A DNA/Upconversion Nanoparticle Complex Enables Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and Photodynamic Agents for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional DNA/upconversion nanoparticle complex is constructed, which enables the controlled co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, hemin, and protoporphyrin for synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) activated by near&#8208;infrared light. The integrated functions of gene editing and PDT allow the substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the light&#8208;irradiated exciting of photosensitizer (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which faces challenges and limitations in hypoxia and antioxidant response of cancer cells, and limited tissue&#8208;penetration of light. Herein, a multifunctional DNA/upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) complex is developed which enables controlled co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, hemin, and protoporphyrin (PP) for synergistic PDT. An ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) is prepared via rolling circle amplification (RCA), which contains recognition sequences of single guide RNA (sgRNA) for loading Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), G&#8208;quadruplex sequences for loading hemin and PP, and linker sequences for combining UCNP. Cas9 RNP cleaves the antioxidant regulator nuclear factor E2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2), improving the sensitivity of cancer cells to ROS, and enhancing the synergistic PDT effect. The G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme mimicks horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the endogenous H2O2 to O2, overcoming hypoxia condition in tumors. The introduced UCNP converts NIR irradiation with deep tissue penetration to light with shorter wavelength, exciting PP to transform the abundant O2 to 1O2. The integration of gene editing and PDT allows substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Ionic Conductors with Tunable Resistance Switching Temperature Enabled by Phase Transformation of Polymer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) with tunable resistance switching temperature are designed by polymer cocrystal phase. These obtained PTICs have ultrahigh temperature sensitivity in the resistance switching region and can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) show significant prospects for functional applications due to their reversible resistance switching property. However, the representative design principle of PTICs is utilizing the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of ionic liquids, and the resistance switching temperatures of such PTICs cannot be tuned as desired. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to design PTICs with on&#8208;demand resistance switching temperatures by using the melt&#8208;crystallization transition of polymer cocrystal phase, whose melting temperature shows a linear relationship with the polymer compositions. Owing to the melt of polymer cocrystal domains and the tunable migration of ions in the resistance switching region, the obtained PTICs display ultrahigh temperature sensitivity with a superior temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;8.50% &#176;C&#8722;1 around human body temperature, as compared to various ionic conductors previously reported. Therefore, the PTICs can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation. It is believed that this work may inspire future researches on the development of advanced soft electrical devices.

         <title>Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy Augmentation via Sequential Nanocomposite Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Reprogramming of Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts in Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential nanocomposite hydrogel reshaping cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF) behavior is developed, fostering tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The injectable hydrogel based on carboxymethyl chitosan/ tetrabasic polyethylene glycol regulates the release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor) and liposomal Doxorubicin. Combining the gel with a checkpoint inhibitor boosts anti&#8208;tumor immunity in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model.








Abstract
In osteosarcoma, immunotherapy often faces hurdles posed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete dense extracellular matrix components and cytokines. Directly removing CAFs may prove ineffective and even promote tumor metastasis. To address this challenge, a sequential nanocomposite hydrogel that reshapes CAF behavior is developed, enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The approach utilizes an injectable blend of carboxymethyl chitosan and tetrabasic polyethylene glycol, forming a hydrogel for controlled release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor, Nox4i) and liposomal Doxorubicin (L&#8208;Dox) to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) upon in situ administration. Nox4i effectively counters CAF activation, overcoming T&#8208;cell exclusion mechanisms, followed by programmed L&#8208;Dox release for ICD induction in stroma&#8208;rich osteosarcoma models. Combining the co&#8208;delivery gel with &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint inhibitor further enhances its effectiveness in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Immunophenotyping data underscore a significant boost in tumor T&#8208;cell infiltration and favorable anti&#8208;tumor immunity at the whole&#8208;animal level.

         <title>3D Tiled Auxetic Metamaterial: A New Family of Mechanical Metamaterial with High Resilience and Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs is demonstrated via new 3D printed auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. The new designs show auxeticity, high resilience, large mechanical hysteresis, ideal isotropy, and a unique coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials.








Abstract
For artificial materials, desired properties often conflict. For example, engineering materials often achieve high energy dissipation by sacrificing resilience and vice versa, or desired auxeticity by losing their isotropy, which limits their performance and applications. To solve these conflicts, a strategy is proposed to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs, exemplified via auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. This metamaterial shows high resilience while achieving large mechanical hysteresis synergistically under large compressive strain. Especially, this metamaterial exhibits ideal isotropy approaching the theoretical limit of isotropic Poisson's ratio, &#8208;1, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials. In addition, the new class of metamaterials provides wide tunability on mechanical properties and behaviors, including an unusual coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior under normal compression. The designing methodology is illustrated by the integral of numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and experimental characterization. The new mechanical metamaterials have broad applications in actuators and dampers, soft robotics, biomedical materials, and engineering materials/systems for energy dissipation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptive Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes against Viruses in the Cold Chain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study prepares FeN4P2 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes) with low&#8208;temperature adaptive OXD&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (4, and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), which efficiently inactivate multiple enveloped viruses by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope; Additionally, under conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment.








Abstract
Outbreaks of viral infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) and influenza A virus (IAV), pose a great threat to human health. Viral spread is accelerated worldwide by the development of cold chain logistics; Therefore, an effective antiviral approach is required. In this study, it is aimed to develop a distinct antiviral strategy using nanozymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability, suitable for cold chain logistics. Phosphorus (P) atoms are added to the remote counter position of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C center to prepare FeN4P2&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), exhibiting lipid oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (&#8722;20, and 4&#160;&#176;C). This feature enables FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes to disrupt multiple enveloped viruses (human, swine, and avian coronaviruses, and H1&#8208;H11 subtypes of IAV) by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope. Under the simulated conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment; Therefore, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability and broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral properties may serve as key materials for developing specific antiviral approaches to interrupt viral transmission through the cold chain.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic and Photovoltaic Performance Arising from Unconventionally Low Donor&#8211;Y6 Ratios</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the use of unconventionally low donor:acceptor ratios of PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 blends for enhanced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance. Inclusion of the donor in nanoparticle suspensions or solid&#8208;state films at low donor mass ratios provide a novel method of reducing the rate of charge recombination in Y6, leading to high performance.








Abstract
Development of both organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic photocatalysts has focused on utilizing the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The BHJ promotes charge separation and enhances the carrier lifetime, but may give rise to increased charge traps, hindering performance. Here, high photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is displayed by electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) nanoparticles (NPs) and films, using the nonfullerene acceptor Y6 and polymer donor PIDT&#8208;T8BT. In contrast to conventional D&#8211;A systems, the charge generation in PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 NPs is mainly driven by Y6, allowing a high performance even at a low D:A mass ratio of 1:50. The high performance at the low mass ratio is attributed to the amorphous behavior of PIDT&#8208;T8BT. Low ratios are generally thought to yield lower efficiency than the more conventional &#8776;1:1 ratio. However, the OPVs exhibit peak performance at a D:A ratio of 1:5. Similarly the NPs used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution show peak performance at the 1:6.7 D:A ratio. Interestingly, for the PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 system, as the polymer proportion increases, a reduced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is observed. The unconventional D:A ratios provide lower recombination losses and increased charge&#8208;carrier lifetime with undisrupted ambipolar charge transport in bulk Y6, enabling better performance than conventional ratios. This work reports novel light&#8208;harvesting materials in which performance is reduced due to unfavorable morphology as D:A ratios move toward conventional ratios of 1:1.2&#8211;1:1.

         <title>Chemical Rules for Stacked Kagome and Honeycomb Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing tight&#8208;binding model and high&#8208;throughput calculation, the chemical rules governing topological states have been studied in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices.Calculation results reveal that the IAMX family materials are topological nodal&#8208;line semimetals categorized into four groups, and change into Weyl semimetals with spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The detailed chemical rule analysis paves a way to study the rich topological states in kagome materials.








Abstract
The chemical rules for predicting and understanding topological states in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices are studied in both analytical and numerical ways. Starting with a minimal five&#8208;band tight&#8208;binding model, all the topological states are sorted into five groups, which are determined by the interlayer and intralayer hopping parameters. Combined with the model, an algorithm is designed to obtain a series of experimentally synthesized topological semimetals with kagome and honeycomb layers, i.e., IAMX family (IA = Alkali metal element, M = Rare earth metal element, X = Carbon group element), in the inorganic crystal structure database. A follow&#8208;up high&#8208;throughput calculation shows that IAMX family materials are all nodal&#8208;line semimetals and they will be Weyl semimetals after taking spin&#8208;orbit coupling into consideration. To have further insights into the topology of the IAMX family, a detailed chemical rule analysis is carried out on the high&#8208;throughput calculations, including the lattice constants of the structure, intralayer and interlayer couplings, bond strengths, electronegativity, and so on, which are consistent with the tight&#8208;binding model. This study provides a way to discover and modulate topological properties in stacked kagome and honeycomb crystals and offers candidates for studying topology&#8208;related properties like topological superconductors and axion&#160;insulators.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Scaffold&#8208;Assisted Tumor Vaccines Induce Tumor Regression and Long&#8208;Term Immune Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds enhance the efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines using tumor protein antigen and an immune&#8208;stimulating STING agonist. ECM scaffolds prolong antigen release and recruit antigen&#8208;presenting cells to help generate heightened cytotoxic T cell responses leading to effective tumor killing.








Abstract
Injectable scaffold delivery is a strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccine immunotherapy. The choice of scaffold biomaterial is crucial, impacting both vaccine release kinetics and immune stimulation via the host response. Extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds prepared from decellularized tissues facilitate a pro&#8208;healing inflammatory response that promotes local cancer immune surveillance. Here, an ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted therapeutic cancer vaccine that maintains an immune microenvironment consistent with tissue reconstruction is engineered. Several immune&#8208;stimulating adjuvants are screened to develop a cancer vaccine formulated with decellularized small intestinal submucosa (SIS) ECM scaffold co&#8208;delivery. It is found that the STING pathway agonist cyclic di&#8208;AMP most effectively induces cytotoxic immunity in an ECM scaffold vaccine, without compromising key interleukin 4 (IL&#8208;4) mediated immune pathways associated with healing. ECM scaffold delivery enhances therapeutic vaccine efficacy, curing 50&#8211;75% of established E.G&#8208;7OVA lymphoma tumors in mice, while none are cured with soluble vaccine. SIS&#8208;ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted vaccination prolonged antigen exposure is dependent on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and generates long&#8208;term antigen&#8208;specific immune memory for at least 10 months post&#8208;vaccination. This study shows that an ECM scaffold is a promising delivery vehicle to enhance cancer vaccine efficacy while being orthogonal to characteristics of pro&#8208;healing immune hallmarks.

         <title>Ultraflexible Wireless Imager Integrated with Organic Circuits for Broadband Infrared Thermal Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultraflexible imager incorporating carbon nanotube photodetectors and organic circuits is developed for infrared imaging. This imager, which employs an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix, exhibits high sensitivity to broadband infrared light. The functionality of the imaging system is verified through its application in thermal imaging, confirming that it facilitates the analysis of heat sources, biological movements, and in&#8208;liquid glucose.








Abstract
Flexible imagers are currently under intensive development as versatile optical sensor arrays, designed to capture images of surfaces and internals, irrespective of their shape. A significant challenge in developing flexible imagers is extending their detection capabilities to encompass a broad spectrum of infrared light, particularly terahertz (THz) light at room temperature. This advancement is crucial for thermal and biochemical applications. In this study, a flexible infrared imager is designed using uncooled carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors and organic circuits. The CNT sensors, fabricated on ultrathin 2.4&#160;&#181;m substrates, demonstrate enhanced sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to THz wavelengths. Moreover, they retain their characteristics under bending and crumpling. The design incorporates light&#8208;shielded organic transistors and circuits, functioning reliably under light irradiation, and amplifies THz detection signals by a factor of 10. The integration of both CNT sensors and shielded organic transistors into an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix within the imager enables sequential infrared imaging and nondestructive assessment for heat sources and in&#8208;liquid chemicals through wireless communication systems. The proposed imager, offering unique functionality, shows promise for applications in biochemical analysis and soft robotics.

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Mechanoluminescence from 0D Hybrid Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions are achieved in 0D chiral Mn&#8208;based hybrid manganese halides with large conjugate ligands. These compounds exhibit highly bright and sensitive green CPML emissions with an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect, and then are demonstrated as chiral stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in multilevel confidential information encryption.








Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have application prospects in many fields, due to their abundant host&#8211;guest structures and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). However, CPLs in HMHs are predominantly excited by light or electricity, limiting their use in multivariate environments. It is necessary to explore a novel excitation method to extend the application of chiral HMHs as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive optical materials. In this work, an enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid manganese bromides, [H2(2R,4R)&#8208;(+)/(2S,4S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;2,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane]MnBr4 [(R/S)&#8208;1] is presented, which exhibits efficient CPL emissions with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and high dissymmetry factors of &#177; 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Notably, (R/S)&#8208;1 compounds exhibit unprecedented and bright circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions under mechanical stimulation. Moreover, (R/S)&#8208;1 possess high mechanical force sensitivities with mechanoluminescence (ML) emissions detectable under 0.1 N force stimulation. Furthermore, this ML emission exhibits an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect in the temperature range of 300&#8211;380 K, which is revealed to originate from a thermal activation energy compensation mechanism from trap levels to Mn(II) 4T1 level. Based on their intriguing optical properties, these compounds as chiral force&#8208;responsive materials are demonstrated in multilevel confidential information encryption.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Synthesis of Metallic Glass Nanoparticles with Expanded Composition Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction featuring ultrafast heating and cooling is developed for the general synthesis of Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based metallic glass nanoparticles (MGNPs) with good control over their composition, particle size, dispersity, and supporting substrates. The nanoscale MG has an expanded composition space than its bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability.








Abstract
Nanoscale metallic glasses offer opportunities for investigating fundamental properties of amorphous solids and technological applications in biomedicine, microengineering, and catalysis. However, their top&#8208;down fabrication is limited by bulk counterpart availability, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis remains underexplored due to strict formation conditions. Here, a kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction is developed, featuring ultrafast heating (&gt;105 K s&#8722;1) and cooling rates (&gt;104 K s&#8722;1), for synthesizing metallic glass nanoparticles within milliseconds. Nine compositional permutations of noble metals, base metals, and metalloid (M1&#9472;M2&#9472;P, M1 = Pt/Pd, M2 = Cu/Ni/Fe/Co/Sn) are synthesized with widely tunable particle sizes and substrates. Through combinatorial development, a substantially expanded composition space for nanoscale metallic glass is discovered compared to bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability. Leveraging this, several nanoscale metallic glasses are synthesized with composition that have never, to the knowledge, been synthesized in bulk. The metallic glass nanoparticles exhibit high activity in heterogeneous catalysis, outperforming crystalline metal alloy nanoparticles.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable operation of high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries with tamed electrode interphase is obtained via innovation in electrolyte chemistry. Benefiting from the suppressed cathode electrolyte interphase dissolution, advanced Na+ storage performance, including outstanding cycling stability as long as 8 months and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 to 60 &#176;C, is achieved in the high&#8208;voltage Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathode.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next-generation grid-scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threaten the long-term cycling of high-energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution, and fast capacity fade. Here, this work proposes a balanced principle for the molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enables an ultra-thin, homogeneous, and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation-stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI,&#160;but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (&amp;gt;90%) over 3000 cycles (8 months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3&#8201;V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500&#8201;cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%.

         <title>Bridging the Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis by Supramolecular Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Varied Packing Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of {Cu12} based tetrahedral (Td) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with varied packing modes are self&#8208;assembled, which act as highly active homogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. The varied packing of Td cages from hexagonal to cubic mode in the MOC enables one&#8208;step heterogenous separation of the catalyst, co&#8208;catalyst, and product, which perfectly bridges the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Integrating the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has proved to be an optimal strategy for developing catalytic systems with high efficiency, selectivity, and recoverability. Supramolecular metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), assembled by the coordination of metal ions with organic linkers into discrete molecules, have performed solvent processability due to their tunable packing modes, endowing them with the potential to act as homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in different solvent systems. Here, the design and synthesis of a series of stable {Cu3} cluster&#8208;based tetrahedral MOCs with varied packing structures are reported. These MOCs, as homogeneous catalysts, not only show high catalytic activity and selectivity regardless of substrate size during the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, but also can be easily recovered from the reaction media through separating products and co&#8208;catalysts by one&#8208;step work&#8208;up. This is because that these MOCs have varied solubilities in different solvents due to the tunable packing of MOCs in the solid state. Moreover, the entire catalytic reaction system is very clean, and the purity of cyclic carbonates is as high as 97% without further purification. This work provides a unique strategy for developing novel supramolecular catalysts that can be used for homogeneous catalysis and recycled in a heterogeneous manner.

         <title>Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off in Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic doping operation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) renders the understanding of the efficiency roll&#8208;off challenging. Herein, a method for quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. It reveals that singlet&#8208;polaron quenching strongly affects the efficiency roll&#8208;off in singlet&#8208;emitting LECs because of increasing polaron concentration in the p&#8208;n junction with increasing current .








Abstract
Understanding &#8220;efficiency roll&#8208;off&#8221; (i.e., the drop in emission efficiency with increasing current) is critical if efficient and bright emissive technologies are to be rationally designed. Emerging light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) can be cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiently fabricated by ambient&#8208;air printing by virtue of the in situ formation of a p&#8208;n junction doping structure. However, this in situ doping transformation renders a meaningful efficiency analysis challenging. Herein, a method for separation and quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. Specifically, the position of the emissive p&#8208;n junction in common singlet&#8208;exciton emitting LECs is measured to shift markedly with increasing current, and the influence of this shift on the outcoupling efficiency is quantified. It is further verified that the LEC&#8208;characteristic high electrochemical&#8208;doping concentration renders singlet&#8208;polaron quenching (SPQ) significant already at low drive current density, but also that SPQ increases super&#8208;linearly with increasing current, because of increasing polaron density in the p&#8208;n junction region. This results in that SPQ dominates singlet&#8208;singlet quenching for relevant current densities, and significantly contributes to the efficiency roll&#8208;off. This method for deciphering the LEC efficiency roll&#8208;off can contribute to a rational realization of all&#8208;printed LEC devices that are efficient at highluminance.

         <title>Charge Carrier Induced Structural Ordering And Disordering in Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of charge density on the stability and operation of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor is examined. Operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that charge carriers initially induce order within the crystallites at low charge densities, but further carrier density increases lead to a structural disordering of the crystallites, irreversibly decreasing conductivity and mobility.








Abstract
Operational stability underpins the successful application of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) in a wide range of fields, including biosensing, neuromorphic computing, and wearable electronics. In this work, both the operation and stability of a p&#8208;type OMIEC material of various molecular weights are investigated. Electrochemical transistor measurements reveal that device operation is very stable for at least 300 charging/discharging cycles independent of molecular weight, provided the charge density is kept below the threshold where strong charge&#8211;charge interactions become likely. When electrochemically charged to higher charge densities, an increase in device hysteresis and a decrease in conductivity due to a drop in the hole mobility arising from long&#8208;range microstructural disruptions are observed. By employing operando X&#8208;ray scattering techniques, two regimes of polaron&#8208;induced structural changes are found: 1) polaron&#8208;induced structural ordering at low carrier densities, and 2) irreversible structural disordering that disrupts charge transport at high carrier densities, where charge&#8211;charge interactions are significant. These operando measurements also reveal that the transfer curve hysteresis at high carrier densities is accompanied by an analogous structural hysteresis, providing a microstructural basis for such instabilities. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the structural dynamics and material instabilities of OMIEC materials during device operation.

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Regulated Nanochannels for Flexible Hydrovoltaic Ion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controllable nanochannel regulation for flexible hydrovoltaic ion sensing is developed to simultaneously achieve a high surface potential, matching nanochannel size and high structural stability, resulting in a high&#8208;performance hydrovoltaic device with a Voc of 4.82 V in DI water, sensitivity as high as 1.37 V dec&#8722;1, and a sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100 M.








Abstract
The evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion&#8208;selective nanochannels can theoretically be employed for high&#8208;performance ion sensing; yet, the indeterminate ion&#8208;sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance are rarely explored. Herein, a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing abilities is presented across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip&#8208;coating of silk fibroin (SF) on an electrospinning nylon&#8208;66 nanofiber (NNF) film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100&#160;m, and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (SC&#8208;ISEs). The fabricated flexible ion&#8208;sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace&#8208;ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy for controllable nanochannel regulation for flexible hydrovoltaic ion sensing is developed to simultaneously achieve a high surface potential, matching nanochannel size and high structural stability, resulting in a high-performance hydrovoltaic device with a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.82 V in DI water, sensitivity as high as 1.37 V dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a sensing range of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; M.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaporation-induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion-selective nanochannels can theoretically be employed for high-performance ion sensing; yet, the indeterminate ion-sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance are rarely explored. Herein, a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion-sensing abilities is presented across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip-coating of silk fibroin (SF) on an electrospinning nylon-66 nanofiber (NNF) film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m,&lt;/span&gt; and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs). The fabricated flexible ion-sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace-ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultraclean Interface of Metal Chalcogenides with Metal through Confined Interfacial Chalcogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) method to develop robust transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possessing an ultraclean interface with a metal presents a promising alternative to conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CIC&#8208;TMDs overcome limitations associated with CVD such as defects, doping impurities, and degradation, thus proving to be versatile for the development of memristors for electronic devices.








Abstract
Acquisition of defect&#8208;free transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) channels with clean heterojunctions is a critical issue in the production of TMD&#8208;based functional electronic devices. Conventional approaches have transferred TMD onto a target substrate, and then apply the typical device fabrication processes. Unfortunately, those processes cause physical and chemical defects in the TMD channels. Here, a novel synthetic process of TMD thin films, named confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) is proposed. In the proposed synthesis, a uniform TMDlayer is created at the Au/transition metal (TM) interface by diffusion of chalcogen through the upper&#160;Au layer and the reaction of chalcogen with the underlying TM. CIC allows for ultraclean heterojunctions with the metals, synthesis of various homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;structured TMDs, and in situ TMD channel formation in the last stage of device fabrication. The mechanism of TMD growth is revealed by the TM&#8208;accelerated chalcogen diffusion, epitaxial growth of TMD on Au(111). We demonstrated a wafer&#8208;scale TMD&#8208;based vertical memristors which exhibit excellent statistical concordance in device performance enabled by the ultraclean heterojunctions and superior uniformity in thickness. CIC proposed in this study represents a breakthrough in in TMD&#8208;based electronic device fabrication and marking a substantial step toward practical next&#8208;generation integrated electronics.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Memtransistors with Magnetized Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic CrI3 is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer, which achieves reliable memtransistor operations based on the electrical control of the magnetic proximity effect.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized bands in pristine and proximity&#8208;induced magnetic materials are promising building blocks for future devices. Conceptually new memory, logic, and neuromorphic devices are conceived based on atomically thin magnetic materials and the manipulation of their spin&#8208;polarized bands via electrical and optical methods. A critical remaining issue is the direct probe and the optimized use of the magnetic coupling effect in van der Waals heterostructures, which requires further delicate design of atomically thin magnetic materials and devices. Here, a spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic material, CrI3, is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer. The microscopic working principle is clarified by the first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis of the transport data. Reliable memtransistor operations (i.e., memory and logic device&#8208;combined operations), as well as a spin&#8208;selective probe of Landau levels in the magnetized graphene, are achieved by using the subtle manipulation of the magnetic proximity effect via electrical means.

         <title>Nanoengineered Red Blood Cells Loaded with TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L Inhibitors Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Pseudovirus Entry into Lung ACE2+ Cells</title>

Dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (Camostat and E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) are constructed, conjugated with an anti&#8208;hACE2 antibody and employed RBC&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs&#8221;, for effectively blocking SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 cell entry in the lungs, regardless of virus variations. The nano&#8208;micro system is modular (anti&#8208;receptor antibody + drug&#8208;loaded NCs + RBCs), and the findings will benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.








Abstract
The enzymatic activities of Furin, Transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), Cathepsin L (CTSL), and Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding are necessary for the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. Precise inhibition of these key proteases in ACE2+ lung cells during a viral infection cycle shall prevent viral Spike (S) protein activation and its fusion with a host cell membrane, consequently averting virus entry to the cells. In this study, dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat and CTSL inhibitor E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) are constructed conjugated with an anti&#8208;human ACE2 (hACE2) antibody and employ Red Blood Cell (RBC)&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs,&#8221; for targeting lung cells. The significant therapeutic efficacy of the dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanoengineered RBCs in pseudovirus&#8208;infected K18&#8208;hACE2 transgenic mice is reported. Notably, the modular nanoengineered RBCs (anti&#8208;receptor antibody+NCs+RBCs) precisely target key proteases of host cells in the lungs to block the entry of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), regardless of virus variations. These findings are anticipated to benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

         <title>Revealing the Substrate Constraint Effect on the Thermodynamic Behaviour of the Pd&#8211;H through Capacitive&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Sorption Measurement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate constraint effect on the metal&#8211;hydrogen system can result in significant mechanical stress during hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. However, a quantitative study of this effect is challenging due to the limitations in measurement techniques. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is employed to reveal the influence of substrate constraint on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system.








Abstract
Mechanical constraints imposed on the Pd&#8211;H system can induce significant strain upon hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion, potentially leading to changes in the thermodynamic behavior, such as the phase&#8208;transition pressure. However, the investigation of the constraint effect is often tricky due to the lack of simple experimental techniques for measuring hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is developed to monitor hydrogenation&#8208;induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system is investigated. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, it is found that the diffefrence in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase&#8208;transition pressure when the Pd&#8211;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. These experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8211;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive&#8208;based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8211;H systems.

In this study, a capacitive-based measurement system is developed to monitor hydrogenation-induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system is investigated. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, it is found that the diffefrence in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase-transition pressure when the Pd&#8211;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. These experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8211;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive-based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8211;H systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Pouch Cell Using Cu3P Nanowires In Situ Grown on Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3P nanowires in situ grown on the current collector are capable of realizing uniform deposition of sodium metal during repeated cycling, which is attributed to low Na+ absorption energy and diffusion energy barrier on Na3P. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode successfully enables anode&#8208;free sodium metal pouch cell with stable cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AFSMB) promises high energy density but suffers from the difficulty of maintaining high cycling stability. Nonuniform sodium (Na) deposition on the current collector is largely responsible for capacity decay in the cycling process of AFSMB. Here, a unique copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanowire is constructed on copper (Cu3P@Cu) as a sodium deposition substrate by an in situ growth method. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode is delivered in asymmetric cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for over 800 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. The symmetric cell of Cu3P@Cu displayed a cycling lifespan of over 2000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. Cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscope&#160;characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na+ absorption energy and low Na+ diffusion energy barrier on Na3P promoted uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode&#8208;free Na3V2(PO4)3//Cu3P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8776;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.

         <title>Performance Enhancement of the Li6PS5Cl&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries by Scavenging Lithium Dendrites with LaCl3&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the ability of Li6PS5Cl against Li dendrites for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries, inserting a thin layer of LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte inside Li6PS5Cl produces a sandwich&#8208;structured composite electrolyte, which presents greatly&#8208;improved critical current density, cycling lifetime and rate capability. The enhancing mechanism is assigned to the Li&#8208;scavenging capability of the LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte.








Abstract
Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) is a very attractive sulfide solid electrolyte for developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, it cannot suppress the growth of lithium dendrites and then can only tolerate a small critical current density (CCD) before getting short&#8208;circuited to death. Learning from that a newly&#8208;developed LaCl3&#8208;based electrolyte (LTLC) can afford a very large CCD, a three&#8208;layer sandwich&#8208;structured electrolyte is designed by inserting LTLC inside LPSC. Remarkably, compared with bland LPSC, this hybrid electrolyte LPSC/LTLC/LPSC presents extraordinary performance improvements: the CCD gets increased from 0.51 to 1.52&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the lifetime gets prolonged from 7&#160;h to &gt;500&#160;h at the cycling current of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and the cyclability gets extended from 10 cycles to &gt;200 cycles at the cycling rate of 0.5&#160;C and 30&#160;&#176;C in Li|electrolyte|NCM721 full cells. The enhancing reasons are assigned to the capability of LTLC to scavenge lithium dendrites, forming a passive layer of Ta, La, and LiCl.

         <title>Interior&#8208;Confined Vacancy in Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for Ultra&#8208;Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface repair strategy is proposed to reduce the content of Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF). KMHCF with 2% VFeCN is obtained at 90 &#176;C, and VFeCN is mainly concentrated in the lattice interior. The eliminated surface VFeCN can inhibit the Mn2+ dissolution into the electrolyte, resulting in excellent cycling performance in potassium ion batteries.








Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are viewed as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities and redox potentials. However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, a repair method is proposed that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF&#8208;H). The KMHCF&#8208;H obtained at 90 &#176;C contains only 2% VFeCN, and the VFeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe&#8211;CN&#8211;Mn surface structure of the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode with repaired surface VFeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF&#8208;H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half&#8208;cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles) and full&#8208;cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). This thermal repair method enables scalable preparation of KMHCF with a low content of vacancies, holding substantial promise for practical applications of PIBs.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1&#8208;Volt Electrically Programmable Optical Modulator Based on Active Tamm Plasmon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controllable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate signifies a breakthrough in optical switching, achieving a modulation depth surpassing 88% (&#8776;99% theoretically) in the near&#8208;infrared range at sub&#8208;1&#8208;volt levels. This device holds the potential to accelerate advancements in scalable optical modulators and non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical devices. Consequently, it extends applications to rewritable optical memory storage with neuromorphic behavior.








Abstract
Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high&#8208;density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought&#8208;after wavelength window for free&#8208;space communication and imaging applications. Here, electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced. The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire NIR range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% is achieved using a CMOS&#8208;compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, the potential applications of the device are extended for a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long&#8208;term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.

&lt;p&gt;Electrically controllable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate signifies a breakthrough in optical switching, achieving a modulation depth surpassing 88% (&#8776;99% theoretically) in the near-infrared range at sub-1-volt levels. This device holds the potential to accelerate advancements in scalable optical modulators and non-volatile multi-memory state optical devices. Consequently, it extends applications to rewritable optical memory storage with neuromorphic behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high-density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near-infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought-after wavelength window for free-space communication and imaging applications. Here, electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced. The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire NIR range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% is achieved using a CMOS-compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, the potential applications of the device are extended for a non-volatile multi-memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long-term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photolithographable Electrolyte for Deeply Rechargeable Zn Microbatteries in On&#8208;Chip Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caffeine is introduced to ZnSO4 solution, forming a photolithographable electrolyte with an ultraviolet light curable polymer. Zn&#8208;rich interphase is built up over cycling, and stabilizes the Zn anode and hence reversibility of both half and full cells over a broad dimension from several centimeters down to hundreds of micrometers.








Abstract
Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV&#8208;crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn2+ ions forms a Zn2+&#8208;conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO3 and 2ZnCO3&#183;3Zn(OH)2 over cycling. The resulting Zn&#8208;rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on&#8208;chip microbatteries, the resulting solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO2 full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss&#8208;roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm2. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on&#8208;chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Polymer Framework Strategy Enabling Printable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells by Mitigating &#8220;Coffee Ring&#8221; Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking is introduced in perovskite precursor to increase their viscosity and homogenize their heat diffusion coefficient. As a result, the Marangoni convection intensity during meniscus printing is properly controlled, thus ensuring the deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and significantly enhancing the reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the coffee&#8208;ring effect.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered ideal candidates for future photovoltaic applications due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. Although solution&#8208;printed manufacturing has shown inherent potential for the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput production of thin&#8208;film semiconductor electronics, the high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;reproducibility deposition of large&#8208;area perovskite remains a bottleneck that restricts their commercialization due to the droplet coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE). In this study, these issues are addressed by introducing an in situ polymer framework. The 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking improves the precursor viscosity and homogenizes its heat diffusion coefficient, counteracting the lateral capillary flow of the colloidal particles and anchoring their flocculent movement. Thus, the Marangoni convection intensity is properly controlled to ensure high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which significantly enhances reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the CRE. Subsequently, the perovskite solar cells and modules achieve power conversion efficiencies of 23.94 and 17.53%, and exhibit positive environmental stability, retaining over 90 and 78% efficiency after storage for 2500 and 1600&#160;h, respectively. This work may serves as a foundation for exploring precursor rheology to match the homogeneous deposition requirements of perovskite photovoltaics and facilitating the advancement of their printing manufacturing and commercialization transition.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation in ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Water&#8208;Splitting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>

Re1&#8722;xVxSe2 alloy nanosheets consisted of atomic structures that boost synergically the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction over a wide composition range.








Abstract
It is challenging to control the electronic structure of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) for extended applications in renewable energy devices. Here, ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 (Re1&#8722;xVxSe2) alloy nanosheets over the whole composition range via a colloidal reaction is synthesized. Increasing x makes the nanosheets more metallic and induces a 1T&#8243;&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition at x = 0.5&#8211;0.6. Compared to the MoSe2&#8208;VSe2 and WSe2&#8208;VSe2 alloy nanosheets, ReSe2 and VSe2 are mixed more homogeneously at the atomic scale. The alloy nanosheets at x = 0.1&#8211;0.7 exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that alloying caused the Re and V atoms to be synergically more active in the HER. Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) and density of state calculations confirm that alloying and Se vacancies effectively activate the metal sites toward HER. The composition dependence of HER performance is explained by homogenous atomic mixing with the increased Se vacancies. The study provides a strategy for designing new TMD alloy nanosheets with enhanced catalytic activity.

         <title>Concurrent Mechanisms of Hot Electrons and Interfacial Water Molecule Ordering in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the disordered arrangement, water molecules on the solid&#8211;liquid interface exhibit weakened hydrogen bonds accompanied by an ordered distribution under the LSPR effect excited by light illumination, which leads to an improved electron transfer efficiency and proton supply; therefore, enhancing the NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency in NRR.








Abstract
The participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons generated from the non&#8208;radiative decay of localized surface plasmons is an important mechanism for promoting catalytic processes. Herein, another vital mechanism associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, significantly contributing to the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is found. That is to say, the LSPR&#8208;induced strong localized electric fields can weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and regulate the arrangement of water molecules at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The AuCu pentacle nanoparticles with excellent light absorption ability and the capability to generate strong localized electric fields are chosen to demonstrate this effect. The in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations are employed to verify the mechanism at the molecular scale in a nitrogen fixation process. Meanwhile, due to the promoted electron transfer at the interface by the well&#8208;ordered interfacial water, as well as the participation of high&#8208;energy hot electrons, the optimal catalyst exhibits excellent performance with an NH3 yield of 52.09 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.82% at &#9472;0.20&#160;V versus RHE. The results are significant for understanding the LSPR effect in catalysis and provide a new approach for regulating the reaction process.

Meanwhile, due to the promoted electron transfer at the interface by the well-ordered interfacial water, as well as the participation of high-energy hot electrons, the optimal catalyst exhibits excellent performance with an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 52.09 &#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.82% at &#9472;0.20&#160;V versus RHE. The results are significant for understanding the LSPR effect in catalysis and provide a new approach for regulating the reaction process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Tumor Calcification&#8208;Guided Early Diagnosis and Eradication of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SA@CaO2 MSs combined with transcatheter arterial embolization&#160;(TAE) technology can initiate tumor calcification, and facilitate the tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Additionally, research also shows that upregulated calreticulin (CALR) in association with tumor calcification, which may be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.








Abstract
Tumor calcification is found to be associated with the benign prognostic, and which shows considerable promise as a somewhat predictive index of the tumor response clinically. However, calcification is still a missing area in clinical cancer treatment. A specific strategy is proposed for inducing tumor calcification through the synergy of calcium peroxide (CaO2)&#8208;based microspheres and transcatheter arterial embolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The persistent calcium stress in situ specifically leads to powerful tumor calcioptosis, resulting in diffuse calcification and a high&#8208;density shadow on computed tomography that enables clear localization of the in vivo tumor site and partial delineation of tumor&#160;margins in an orthotopic HCC rabbit model. This osmotic calcification can facilitate tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis identify that calreticulin (CALR) is a crucial target protein involved in tumor calcioptosis. Further fluorescence molecular imaging analysis also indicates that CALR can be used as a prodromal marker of calcification to predict tumor response at an earlier stage in different preclinical rodent models. These findings suggest that upregulated CALR in association with tumor calcification, which may be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Trapped Bioinspired Lipoprotein Prolongs Tumor Retention to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, a protease&#8208;sensitive TNC and FN1&#8208;binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) system (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can preferentially bind to the FN1 and TNC in tumors to prolong their retention capacity, thereby profoundly potentiating the antitumor immunity and producing notable therapeutic benefits .








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effects of many therapeutic agents are significantly challenged by their insufficient delivery efficiency and short retention time in tumors. Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, herein a protease&#8208;activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) is designed and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) is proposed that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP treatment produces a 6.96&#8208;, 9.24&#8208;, 6.72&#8208;, 7.32&#8208;, and 6.73&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells and their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208;, granzyme B&#8208;, perforin&#8208;, and Ki67&#8208;expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM&#8208;trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Green Asymmetric Bicyclic Co&#8208;Solvent Molecule for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Isosorbide dimethyl ether (IDE) is used as a green co&#8208;solvent for high&#8208;voltage, low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration hybrid aqueous electrolytes. The unique 3D molecular structure of IDE enables anion&#8208;participated solvation structures and optimized hydrogen bonding networks, effectively expanding the voltage window to 4.3 V and achieving an outstanding cycling performance for the LTO|| LMO full cell over 450 cycles at 2 C.








Abstract
Hybridizing aqueous electrolytes with organic co&#8208;solvents can effectively expand the voltage window of aqueous electrolytes while reducing salt usage, but most reported co&#8208;solvents are usually flammable and toxic, hardly achieving compatibility between safety and electrochemical performance. Here, a new non&#8208;flammable and non&#8208;toxic low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1.85 m) aqueous electrolyte is reported using the green co&#8208;solvent isosorbide dimethyl ether (IDE). Owing to its unique 3D molecular structure, IDE can form a five&#8208;membered ring structure by binding the Li ion. The steric hindrance effect from IDE weakens its solvation ability, generating anion&#8208;participated solvation structures that produce a robust and uniform LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer while containing elastic IDE&#8208;derived organics. Moreover, the multiple O atoms in IDE can effectively regulate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks, reducing H2O molecule activity and expanding the electrochemical window. Such unique solvation structures and optimized hydrogen bonding networks enabled by IDE effectively suppress electrode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, achieving a 4.3 V voltage window. The as&#8208;developed Li4Ti5O12(LTO)||LiMn2O4(LMO) full cell delivers outstanding cycling performance over 450 cycles at 2 C. The proposed green hybrid aqueous electrolyte provides a new pathway for developing high&#8208;voltage aqueous lithium batteries.

n&#8208;type materials are known to lag behind p&#8208;type materials in the organic electronics field, which is not only for semiconducting materials but also for n&#8208;type dopants, the status quo of which is not quite satisfactory. Here, a novel n&#8208;type molecular dopant applicable to the vacuum&#8208;deposition process is reported, as well as its applications to organic thermoelectric materials and field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a new efficient versatile n&#8208;type dopant with a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure are described. By employing the tetraphenyl&#8211;dipyranylidene (DP0) framework with two 7&#960;&#8208;electron systems modified with N,N&#8208;dimethylamino groups as the strong electron&#8208;donating substituent, 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis[4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyranylidene (DP7), a closed&#8208;shell molecule with an extremely high&#8208;lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital, close to 4.0&#160;eV below the vacuum level, is successfully developed. Thanks to its thermal stability, DP7 is applicable to vacuum deposition, which allows utilization of DP7 in bulk doping for the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials and contact doping for reducing contact resistance in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors. As vacuum&#8208;deposition processable n&#8208;type dopants are very limited, DP7 stands out as a useful n&#8208;type dopant, particularly for the latter purpose.

         <title>Perforin&#8208;Mimicking Molecular Drillings Enable Macroporous Hollow Lignin Spheres for Performance&#8208;Configurable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse perforin&#8208;mimicking molecular drills are employed to engineer lignin hollow spheres for noncovalent assembly, directing synthesis, polymerization, and catalysis. The exceptional performance mutations correlate with the changes in macro&#8208;openings, including enhancement in catalytic efficiency, transition from nonstick synthetics to ultrastrong adhesives, and transformation of viscous sols to tough nanogels.








Abstract
Despite the first observations that the perforin can punch holes in target cells for live/dead cycles in the human immune system over 110 years ago, emulating this behavior in materials science remains challenging. Here, a perforin&#8208;mimicking molecular drilling strategy is employed to engineer macroporous hollow lignin spheres as performance&#8208;configurable catalysts, adhesives, and gels. Using a toolbox of over 20 molecular compounds, the local curvature of amphiphilic lignin is modulated to generate macroporous spheres with hole sizes ranging from 0 to 100&#160;nm. Multiscale control is precisely achieved through noncovalent assembly directing catalysis, synthesis, and polymerization. Exceptional performance mutations correlate with the changes in hole size, including an increase in catalytic efficiency from 50% to 100%, transition from nonstick synthetics to ultrastrong adhesives (adhesion &#8776;18.3&#160;MPa, exceeding that of classic epoxies), and transformation of viscous sols to tough nanogels. Thus, this study provides a robust and versatile noncovalent route for mimicking perforin&#8208;induced structural variations in cells, representing a significant stride toward the exquisite orchestration of assemblies over multiple length scales.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Sulfur Conversion in High&#8208;Content Carbon Layer Confined Sulfur Cathode Maximizes Voltage and Rate Capability of K&#8211;S Batteries</title>

Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur is confined in carbon layers (SMCS@C) with a record&#8208;high SMCS content of 74.1&#160;wt%. A novel FSI&#8722; regulated sulfur conversion chemistry is observed in K&#8211;S battery, leading to fast and more efficient S conversion. The SMCS@C//K full cells show energy/power densities of 72.8 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted attention in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid the shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid&#8211;solid sulfur conversion. However, the content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid&#8211;solid reactions cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS is confined in turbo carbon layers with a content of &#8776;74.1&#160;wt% via a C/S co&#8208;deposition process. In the K&#8211;S battery assembled by using as&#8208;fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI&#8208;EC/DEC as an electrolyte, anion&#8208;regulated two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5&#8211;2.0&#160;V with a remarkable reversible capacity of 384&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles are found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+&#8208;FSI&#8208;&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&#8722;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S&#9472;S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.

         <title>Switchable Design of Redox&#8208;Enhanced Nonaromatic Quinones Enabled by Conjugation Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Groundbreaking study introduces a novel switchable design strategy aimed at enhancing the intrinsic redox potentials of quinones by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architecture. The research establishes the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of inductive effect of electronic localization near electron&#8208;withdrawing areas and suppressing resonance effect of electronic delocalization in the switched quinones.








Abstract
An innovative switchable design strategy for modulating the electronic structures of quinones is proposed herein, leading to remarkably enhanced intrinsic redox potentials by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architectures. Computational validation of two fundamental hypotheses confirms the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of the inductive effect in switched quinones, which affords significantly improved redox chemistry and overall performance compared to reference quinones. Geometric and electronic analyses provide strong evidence for the restored backbone conjugation and nonaromaticity in the switched quinones, while highlighting the reinforcement of the inductive effect and suppression of the resonance effect. This strategic approach facilitates the development of an exceptional quinone, viz. 2,6&#8208;naphthoquinone, with outstanding performance parameters (338.9 mAh g&#8722;1 and 912.9 mWh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 2,6&#8208;anthraquinone with superior cyclic stability, demonstrates comparable performance (257.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and 702.8 mWh g&#8722;1). These findings offer valuable insights into the design of organic cathode materials with favorable redox chemistry in secondary batteries.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Electrochemical Synthesis of Multiyolk&#8211;Shell Nanocoils for Exceptional Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study endeavors to devise a synthesis strategy for multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC) by capitalizing on the disparate behaviors exhibited by bimetallic alloys within electrochemically programmed mild solutions. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNC demonstrates broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption capabilities and exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Multiyolk&#8211;shell (mYS)&#160;nanostructures have garnered significant interest in various photocatalysis applications such as water splitting and waste treatment. Nonetheless, the complexity and rigorous conditions for the synthesis have hindered their widespread implementation. This study presents a one&#8208;step electrochemical strategy for synthesizing multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC), wherein multiple cores of noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, are embedded within the hollow coil&#8208;shaped FePO4 shell structures, mitigating the challenges posed by conventional methods. By capitalizing on the dissimilar dissolution rates of bimetallic alloy nanocoils in an electrochemically programmed solution, nanocoils of different shapes and materials, including two variations of mYSNCs are successfully fabricated. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNCs exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance for environmental remediation, demonstrating up to 99% degradation of methylene blue molecules within 50&#160;min and 95% degradation of tetracycline within 100&#160;min under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8208;vis) light source. This remarkable performance can be attributed to the abundant electrochemical active sites, internal voids facilitating efficient light harvesting with coil morphology, amplified localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at the plasmonic nanoparticle&#8208;semiconductor interface, and effective band engineering. The innovative approach utilizing bimetallic alloys demonstrates precise geometric control and design of intricate multicomponent hybrid composites, showcasing the potential for developing versatile hollow nanomaterials for catalytic applications.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Hard Janus Nanoparticles Triggered Hierarchical Conductors with Large Stretchability, High Sensitivity, and Superior Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical conductor for decoupling the mechanical/electrical module is developed based on the soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). Its mechanically stretchable layer can evenly disperse stress and dissipate energy, and a flexible conductive network layer can impede the crack propagation and achieve local reconstruction, giving the carbon&#8208;based sensor a wide strain range, high sensitivity, and excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a long&#8208;standing conflict between the large stretchability and high sensitivity for strain sensors, a strategy of decoupling the mechanical/electrical module by constructing the hierarchical conductor has been developed in this study. The hierarchical conductor, consisting of a mechanically stretchable layer, a conductive network layer, and a strongly bonded interface, can be produced in a simple one&#8208;step process with the aid of soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). The introduction of JNPs in the stretchable layer can evenly distribute stress and dissipate energy due to forming the rigid&#8208;flexible homogeneous networks. Specifically, JNPs can drive graphene nanosheets (GNS) to fold or curl, creating the unique JNPs&#8208;GNS building block that can further construct the conductive network. Due to its excellent deformability to hinder crack propagation, the flexible conductive network could be stretched continuously and the local conductive pathways could be reconstructed. Consequently, the hierarchical conductor could detect both subtle strain of 0&#8722;2% and large strain of up to 370%, with a gauge factor (GF) from 66.37 to 971.70, demonstrating outstanding stretchability and sensitivity. And it also owns large tensile strength (5.28&#160;MPa) and high deformation stability. This hierarchical design will give graphene&#8208;based sensors a major boost in emerging applications.

         <title>Homomultivalent Polymeric Nanotraps Disturb Lipid Metabolism Homeostasis and Tune Pyroptosis in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically or pharmaceutically modulating lipid metabolism homeostasis is a promising anti&#8208;tumor strategy, while bioactive material&#8208;based interventions are still limited. This study has fabricated homomultivalent supramolecular nanotraps (PTMCD4) by adjusting the density of heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin on the polymer, which effectively reduces phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels in tumor cells for perturbed lipid metabolism homeostasis and induces lysosomal stress for tumor cell pyroptosis.








Abstract
Genetic manipulations and pharmaceutical interventions to disturb lipid metabolism homeostasis have emerged as an attractive approach for the management of cancer. However, the research on the utilization of bioactive materials to modulate lipid metabolism homeostasis remains constrained. In this study, heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMCD) is utilized to fabricate homomultivalent polymeric nanotraps, and surprisingly, its unprecedented ability to perturb lipid metabolism homeostasis and induce pyroptosis in tumor cells is found. Through modulation of the density of TMCD arrayed on the polymers, one top&#8208;performing nanotrap, PTMCD4, exhibits the most powerful cholesterol&#8208;trapping and depletion capacity, thus achieving prominent cytotoxicity toward different types of tumor cells and encouraging antitumor effects in vivo. The interactions between PTMCD4 and biomembranes of tumor cells effectively enable the reduction of cellular phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels, thus provoking damage to the biomembrane integrity and perturbation of lipid metabolism homeostasis. Additionally, the interplays between PTMCD4 and lysosomes also induce lysosomal stress, activate the nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;like receptor protein 3 inflammasomes, and subsequently trigger tumor cell pyroptosis. To sum up, this study first introduces dendronized bioactive polymers to manipulate lipid metabolism and has shed light on another innovative insight for cancer therapy.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optical Multiclassification Platform for Minimizing Occasional Inaccuracy in Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biomarker Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform enhances anti&#8208;interference ability in rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) with multivariable disturbances, and reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. By validating 501 unprocessed clinical samples in serum and nasopharyngeal/anal swabs, the platform achieves a &#8776;99% accuracy at 100% statistical power and a sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time of 5 min, realizing on&#8208;site diagnosis with accuracy similar to routine laboratory tests.








Abstract
On&#8208;site diagnostic tests that accurately identify disease biomarkers lay the foundation for self&#8208;healthcare applications. However, these tests routinely rely on single&#8208;mode signals and suffer from insufficient accuracy, especially for multiplexed point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) within a few minutes. Here, this work develops a dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform that integrates an electrochemiluminescence sensor and a field&#8208;effect transistor sensor in a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic channel guides the testing samples to flow across electro&#8208;optical sensor units, which produce dual&#8208;mode readouts by detecting infectious biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB), human rhinovirus (HRV), and group B streptococcus (GBS). Then, machine&#8208;learning classifiers generate three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hyperplanes to diagnose different diseases. Dual&#8208;mode readouts derived from distinct mechanisms enhance the anti&#8208;interference ability physically, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided diagnosis in high&#8208;dimensional space reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. Clinical validation studies with 501 unprocessed samples indicate that the platform has an accuracy approaching 99%, higher than the 77%&#8211;93% accuracy of rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing technologies at 100% statistical power (&gt;150 clinical tests). Moreover, the diagnosis time is 5&#160;min without a trade&#8208;off of accuracy. This work solves the occasional inaccuracy issue of rapid on&#8208;site diagnosis, endowing POCT systems with the same accuracy as laboratory tests and holding unique prospects for complicated scenes of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Boosting Efficient and Sustainable Alkaline Water Oxidation on a W&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT Pair&#8208;Sites Catalyst Synthesized via Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general potential cycling topochemical transformation (&#8220;PCTT&#8221;) strategy is used to convert M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT pair sites (M = W, Mo, Mn, V) under the modulation of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals; this TT process can be confirmed by in situ
XAFS. The prepared tungsten&#8208;based pair&#8208;sites catalyst makes a breakthrough of 3000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 high current density and 1000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, the O&#9472;O bond formation process on two Co sites is well confirmed by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory, which breaks the limit of the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;sites.








Abstract
The development of facile methods for constructing highly active, cost&#8208;effective catalysts that meet ampere&#8208;level current density and durability requirements for an oxygen evolution reaction is crucial. Herein, a general topochemical transformation strategy is posited: M&#8208;Co9S8 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are directly converted into M&#8208;CoOOH&#8208;TT (M&#8201;=&#8201;W, Mo, Mn, V) pair&#8208;sites catalysts under the role of incorporating of atomically dispersed high&#8208;valence metals modulators through potential cycling. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy is used to track the dynamic topochemical transformation process at the atomic level. The W&#8208;Co9S8 breaks through the low overpotential of 160&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. A series of pair&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a large current density of approaching 1760&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.68&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline water oxidation and achieve a &#8776;240&#8208;fold enhancement in the normalized intrinsic activity compare to that reported CoOOH, and sustainable stability of 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the O&#9472;O bond formation is confirmed via a two&#8208;site mechanism, supported by in situ synchrotron radiation infrared and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which breaks the limit of adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relationship on conventional single&#8208;site.

         <title>Tunable Donor Aggregation Dominance in a Ternary Matrix of All&#8208;Polymer Blends with Improved Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;acceptor strategy in all&#8208;polymer photovoltaic blends pushes the efficiency up to 18.81%, with decent changes in maximal power point (MPP) tracked&#160;and thermal stress applied&#160;stability tests, where a new phenomenon in that donor aggregation is modulated by the acceptor component is focused on and carefully analyzed. The experience of ternary blend design from here is also expected&#160;to be instructive for other organic photovoltaics&#160;systems.








Abstract
Using two structurally similar polymer acceptors in constructing high&#8208;efficiency ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells is a widely acknowledged strategy; however, the focus thus far has not been on how polymer acceptor(s) would tune the aggregation of polymer donors, and furthermore&#160;film morphology and device performance (efficiency and stability). Herein, it is reported that matching of the celebrity acceptor PY&#8208;IT and the donor PBQx&#8208;TCl results in enhanced H&#8208;aggregation in PBQx&#8208;TCl, which can be finely tuned by controlling the amount of the second acceptor PY&#8208;IV. Consequently, the efficiency&#8208;optimized PY&#8208;IV weight ratio (0.2/1.2) leads to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 18.81%, wherein light&#8208;illuminated operational stability is also enhanced along with well&#8208;protected thermal stability. Such enhancements in the efficiency and operational and thermal stabilities of solar cells can be attributed to morphology optimization and the desired glass transition temperature of the target active layer based on comprehensive characterization. In addition to being a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency case for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, these enhancements are also a successful attempt for using combined acceptors to tune donor aggregation toward optimal morphology, which provides a theoretical basis for the construction of other types of organic photovoltaics beyond all&#8208;polymer solar cells.

         <title>How Reproducible is the Synthesis of Zr&#8211;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks? An Interlaboratory Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It performed an interlaboratory study of the synthesis of the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224. Ten participants independently synthesized the two MOFs and the products are analyzed, primarily by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The success rates are low (one&#8208;three samples corresponding to a pure sample of the correct phase), thus highlighting the problems with irreproducibility in MOF synthesis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of materials that offer great promise in various applications. However, the synthesis remains challenging: for example, a range of crystal structures can often be accessed from the same building blocks, which complicates the phase selectivity. Likewise, the high sensitivity to slight changes in synthesis conditions may cause reproducibility issues. This is crucial, as it hampers the research and commercialization of affected MOFs. Here, it presents the first&#8208;ever interlaboratory study of the synthetic reproducibility of two Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOFs, PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224, to investigate the scope of this problem. For PCN&#8208;222, only one sample out of ten was&#160;phase pure and of the correct symmetry, while for PCN&#8208;224, three are phase pure, although none of these show the spatial linker order characteristic of PCN&#8208;224. Instead, these samples resemble dPCN&#8208;224 (disordered PCN&#8208;224), which has recently been reported. The variability in thermal behavior, defect content, and surface area of the synthesised samples are also studied. The results have important ramifications for field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their crystallization, by highlighting the synthetic challenges associated with a multi&#8208;variable synthesis space and flat energy landscapes characteristic of&#160;MOFs.

         <title>Accelerated Confined Mass Transfer of MoS2 1D Nanotube in Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the high photogenerated electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency and the inherent mass transfer characteristics of MoS2 confined nanotubes, the photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery delivers a high power density (70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and obtains a Li&#8211;O2 battery with excellent rate performance, which fully proves the universality of this confined structure to achieve simple, efficient and fast photogenerated carrier separation dynamics.








Abstract
Applying solar energy into energy storage battery systems is challenging in achieving green and sustainable development, however, the efficient progress of photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes upon the photocathode. Herein, a 1D&#8208;ordered MoS2 nanotube (MoS2&#8208;ONT) with confined mass transfer can be used to extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, which is capable of overcoming the challenge of rapid recombination of electron and holes. The tubular confined space cannot only promote the orderly separation and migration of charge carriers but also realize the accumulation of charge and the rapid activation of oxygen molecules. The concave surface of MoS2&#8208;ONT can improve the carrier separation ability and prolong the carrier lifetime. Meanwhile, the ordered tubular confined space can effectively realize the rapid transfer of charge, ion, and oxygen. Under light irradiation, a fast oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of 70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is achieved, which is the highest value reported for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries. Significantly, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery based on MoS2&#8208;ONT also shows superior rate capability and other exciting battery performance. This work shows the universality of the confined carrier separation strategy in photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>A Microphase&#8208;Separated Design toward an All&#8208;Round Ionic Hydrogel with Discriminable and Anti&#8208;Disturbance Multisensory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel with microphase&#8208;separated structure is designed. This ionic hydrogel exhibits low Young's modulus, large stretchability, high resilience, unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity, and anti&#8208;freezing capability. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli with high discriminability, sensitivity, and anti&#8208;disturbance ability.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic hydrogels with superior all&#8208;round properties that can detect multimodal sensations with excellent discriminability and robustness against external disturbances are highly required for artificial electronic skinapplications. However, some critical material parameters exhibit intrinsic tradeoffs with each other&#160;for most ionic hydrogels. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel is demonstrated by combining three strategies: (1) using of a low crosslinker/monomer ratio to obtain highly entangled polymer chains as the first network; (2) the introduction of zwitterions into the first network; (3) the synthesis of an ultrasoft polyelectrolyte as the second network. This all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel exhibits a low Young's modulus (&lt; 60&#160;kPa), large stretchability (&gt; 900%), high resilience (&gt; 95%), unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity (&gt; 2.0 S&#160;m&#8315;1), and anti&#8208;freezing capability, which have not been achieved before. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli (temperature, pressure, and proximity) with excellent discriminability, high sensitivity, and strong sensing&#8208;robustness against strains or temperature perturbations. The ionic hydrogel sensor exhibits great potential for intelligent electronic skin applications such as reliable health monitoring and accurate object identification.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>

Graphite is tailored into subnanometer graphene by an all&#8208;physical top&#8211;down method. Compared with graphene nanosheets and quantum sheets, subnanometer graphene demonstrates comprehensively and extremely enhanced performances in photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption.








Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials attract increasing interest. However, the effective and controllable production of extremely downsized materials through physical strategies remains a great challenge. Herein, an all&#8208;physical top&#8211;down method for the production of sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene with completely broken lattice is reported. The graphene subnanometer materials (GSNs) with monolayer structures and lateral sizes of &#8776;0.5&#160;nm are obtained. Compared with their bulk, nanosheets, and quantum sheets, the intrinsic GSNs present extremely enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption performances, as well as unique carrier behavior. The non&#8208;equilibrium states induced by the entirely exposed and broken, intrinsic lattices in sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene can be determinative to their extreme performances. This work shows the great potential of broken lattice and provides new insights toward subnanometer materials.

         <title>Robust, Sprayable, and Multifunctional Hydrogel Coating through a Polycation Reinforced (PCR) Surface Bridging Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging method is developed to achieve robust and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations provide superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, leading to ultra&#8208;tough adhesion (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2), remarkable fatigue resistance, and facile construction. This PCR technique offers novel insight for the development of hydrogel hybrid devices.








Abstract
The sprayable hydrogel coatings that can establish robust adhesion onto diverse materials and devices hold enormous potential; however, a significant challenge persists due to monomer hydration, which impedes even coverage during spraying and induces inadequate adhesion post&#8208;gelation. Herein, a polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging strategy is presented to achieve tough and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations offer superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, facilitating an effective spraying application. This PCR&#8208;based hydrogel coatings demonstrate tough adhesion performance to inert PTFE and silicone, including remarkable shear strength (161&#160;&#177;&#160;49&#160;kPa for PTFE), interfacial toughness (198&#160;&#177;&#160;27&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for PTFE), and notable tolerance to cyclic tension (10&#160;000 cycles, 200% strain, silicone). Meanwhile, this method can be applied to various hydrogel formulations, offering diverse functionalities, including underwater adhesion, lubrication, and drug delivery. Furthermore, the PCR concept enables the conformal construction of durable hydrogel coatings onto sophisticated medical devices like cardiovascular stents. Given its simplicity and adaptability, this approach paves an avenue for incorporating hydrogels onto solid surfaces and potentially promotes untapped applications.

         <title>Mitochondrial Localized In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Reprogramming Tumor Immune and Metabolic Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to trigger pro&#8208;death mitophagy, which ultimately simultaneously activates the innate and adaptive immunities of tumor cells to benefit various cancer therapies, including radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This strategy highlights the spatiotemporal regulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on subcellular organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.








Abstract
The inherent immune and metabolic tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors adversely affect the antitumor efficacy of various treatments, which is an urgent issue to be solved in clinical cancer therapy. In this study, a mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to remodel the TME by improving immunogenicity and disrupting the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells. The peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system can be pre&#8208;assembled into nanomicelles in vitro and form functional nanofibers on mitochondria through a cascade&#8208;responsive process involving reductive release, targeted enrichment, and in situ self&#8208;assembly. The organelle&#8208;specific in situ self&#8208;assemblyeffectively switches the role of mitophagy from pro&#8208;survival to pro&#8208;death, which finally induces intense endoplasmic reticulum stress and atypical type II immunogenic cell death. Disintegration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure also impedes the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells, which greatly promotes the immunosuppresive TME remodeling into an immunostimulatory TME. Ultimately, the mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system effectively suppresses tumor metastases, and converts cold tumors into hot tumors with enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study offers a universal strategy for spatiotemporally controlling supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on sub&#8208;organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.

Multiyolk&#8211;Shell Nanocoils
Article number 2312214 by Young Keun Kim and co&#8208;workers presents the synthesis strategy of eight distinct nanocoils featuring varied shapes and compositions. These nanocoils are derived from a bimetallic alloy nanocoil template through meticulous control of electrochemical conditions. The resultant multiyolk&#8208;shell nanocoil (mYSNC), synthesized within an electrochemically programmed aqueous solution, manifests a distinctive and unprecedented structural configuration. The mYSNCs demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic efficiency in water purification, effecting the decomposition of organic matter in water under light irradiation. The unique attributes of its structure render it a hitherto unobserved and promising candidate for applications in advanced photocatalysis.

Flexible Electronics
A minimalistic route is presented to additively manufacture, via laser printing, high&#8208;performing (power factor over 1500 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2) and extremely flexible Bi2Te3 films on plastic foil. This route facilitates large&#8208;area fabrication and complex maskless patterning without organic binders, and leads to the innovative concept of &#8220;cuttable power arrays&#8221; that enables the fast customization of thermoelectric generators for diverse applications. More details can be found in article number 2307945 by Francisco Molina&#8208;Lopez and co&#8208;workers.

&lt;p&gt;A minimalistic route is presented to additively manufacture, via laser printing, high-performing (power factor over 1500 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and extremely flexible Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films on plastic foil. This route facilitates large-area fabrication and complex maskless patterning without organic binders, and leads to the innovative concept of &#8220;cuttable power arrays&#8221; that enables the fast customization of thermoelectric generators for diverse applications. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202307945"&gt;2307945&lt;/a&gt; by Francisco Molina-Lopez and co-workers.

Nanoengineered RBCs
In article number 2310306, Wen Yue, Xue&#8208;Tao Pei, Jun&#8208;Nian Zhou, and co&#8208;workers design nanoengineered red blood cells (RBCs) to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 cell entry in the lungs, regardless of virus variations. The nano&#8208;micro system is modular (anti&#8208;receptor antibody + drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers + RBCs), and the findings will benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

Ultraflexible Wireless Imager
In article number 2309864, Rei Kawabata, Teppei Araki, Yukio Kawano, Tsuyoshi Sekitani, and co&#8208;workers report an ultrathin imager that expands the possibility of non&#8208;destructive testing methods such as &#8220;non&#8208;collecting&#8221; liquid quality evaluation and &#8220;non&#8208;contact&#8221; imaging through wireless communication systems. An active matrix of carbon nanotube photodetectors and organic transistors within the imager demonstrates high sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to terahertz wavelengths, and is expected to be applied to wearable devices and portable imaging devices.

         <title>Solid Interfaces for the Garnet Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the interior interfaces, garnet/anode, and garnet/cathode interfaces are presented separately. The strategies of Li dendrite suppression, interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations, the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are also summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted extensive interests due to the advantages in developing secondary batteries with high energy density and outstanding safety. Possessing high ionic conductivity and the lowest reduction potential among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SSEs, the garnet type SSE is one of the most promising candidates to achieve high performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). However, the elastic modulus of the garnet electrolyte leads to deteriorated interfacial contacts, and the increasing in electronic conduction at either anode/garnet interface or grain boundary results in Li dendrite growth. Here, recent developments of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the strategies of Li dendrite suppression and interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations are presented. A new viewpoint of the double edges of interfacial lithiophobicity is proposed, and the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs are summarized. Moreover, practical roles of the garnet electrolyte in SSLB industry are also discussed. This work delivers insights into the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, which provides not only the promotion of the garnet&#8208;based SSLBs, but also a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial stabilization for the whole SSE family.

         <title>Resistive Memory Devices at the Thinnest Limit: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2D monolayer materials as dielectric or channel layers, resistive memory technology can be in principles scaled down to its thinnest limits. This review is aimed to systematically evaluate the potential and challenges of utilizing the thinnest advanced materials for memristor and memtransistor&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
The Si&#8208;based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling&#8208;down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in&#8208;memory computing and energy&#8208;efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle and device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformities hinder its mass production. 2D materials, as a new type of semiconductor, is successfully employed in various micro/nanoelectronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology. This review evaluates the potential of using the thinnest advanced materials, that is, monolayer 2D materials, for memristor or memtransistor applications, including resistive switching behavior and atomic mechanism, high&#8208;frequency device performances, and in&#8208;memory computing/neuromorphic computing applications. The scaling&#8208;down advantages of promising monolayer 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride are presented. Finally, the technical challenges of these atomic devices for practical applications are elaborately discussed. The study of monolayer&#8208;2D&#8208;material&#8208;based resistive memory is expected to play a positive role in the exploration of beyond&#8208;Si electronic technologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Metal&#8211;Organic Hybrids: Structures, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of metal&#8211;organic hybrids with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is presented. Metal&#8211;organic hybrids include coordination polymers, ionic crystals, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, and so on. The crystal structures, RTP properties, and applications of metal&#8211;organic hybrids are discussed in detail. The prospects of RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids are discussed. This review lays the foundation of developing RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic hybrid (MOH) materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have drawn attention in recent years due to their superior RTP properties of high phosphorescence efficiency and ultralong emission lifetime. Great achievement has been realized in developing MOH materials with high&#8208;performance RTP, but a systematic study on MOH materials with RTP feature is lacking. This review highlights recent advances in metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials. The molecular packing, the photophysical properties, and their applications of metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials are discussed in detail. Metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials can be divided into six parts: coordination polymers, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), metal&#8208;halide hybrids, organic ionic crystals, organic ionic polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites. These RTP materials have been successfully applied in time&#8208;resolved data encryption, fingerprint recognition, information logic gates, X&#8208;ray imaging, and photomemory. This review not only provides the basic principles of designing RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids, but also propounds the future research prospects of RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic hybrid (MOH) materials with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have drawn attention in recent years due to their superior RTP properties of high phosphorescence efficiency and ultralong emission lifetime. Great achievement has been realized in developing MOH materials with high-performance RTP, but a systematic study on MOH materials with RTP feature is lacking. This review highlights recent advances in metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials. The molecular packing, the photophysical properties, and their applications of metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials are discussed in detail. Metal&#8211;organic hybrid RTP materials can be divided into six parts: coordination polymers, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), metal-halide hybrids, organic ionic crystals, organic ionic polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites. These RTP materials have been successfully applied in time-resolved data encryption, fingerprint recognition, information logic gates, X-ray imaging, and photomemory. This review not only provides the basic principles of designing RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids, but also propounds the future research prospects of RTP metal&#8211;organic hybrids. This review offers many effective strategies for developing metal&#8211;organic hybrids with excellent RTP properties, thus satisfying practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Mycotoxin Detection in Food and Feed: Novel Insights from Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nanomaterial fabrication techniques including, the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of metallic, core&#8211;shell and magnetic nanoparticles and top&#8208;down approaches including, lithographic, nonlithographic, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: MXenes and graphene are presented for the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;based detection of mycotoxins in food and feed, with an emphasis on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
The implementation of low&#8208;cost and rapid technologies for the on&#8208;site detection of mycotoxin&#8208;contaminated crops is a promising solution to address the growing concerns of the agri&#8208;food industry. Recently, there have been significant developments in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the direct detection of mycotoxins in food and feed. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in the utilization of SERS through the successful fabrication of novel nanostructured materials. Various bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches have demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. This paper uncovers that limited studies establish detection limits&#160;or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end&#8208;user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on&#8208;site agri&#8208;food applications.

Schematic illustration of in vivo cell reprogramming platforms for in situ cell therapy. Following infusion into the patients, the nanoparticles directly transfer the transgene cargos (plasmid DNA, mRNA, etc.) into the cell of interest (T lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.) and transiently program the targeted cells to express transgenes inside the body.








Abstract
In the past decade, adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the complexity and high costs involved in manufacturing current adoptive cell therapy greatly inhibit its widespread availability and access. To address this, in situ cell therapy, which directly reprograms immune cells inside the body, has recently been developed as a promising alternative. Here, an overview of the recent progress in the development of synthetic nanomaterials is provided to deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA for in situ reprogramming of T cells and macrophages, focusing especially on in situ CAR therapies. Also, the main challenges for in situ immune cell reprogramming are discussed and some approaches to overcome these barriers to fulfill the clinical applications are proposed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in creating polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals and electrocatalytic roles in energy conversion have been systematically summarized. The structures, synthesis, characterizations, electrocatalytic merits, and recent breakthroughs of POM molecules, POMs&#8208;based structures, and POMs&#8208;derived electrocatalysts have been discussed. Notably, the essences and mechanisms of how POMs&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities are outlined.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular metal oxide cluster with unique physical&#8211;chemical properties, have made essential contributions to creating efficient and robust electrocatalysts in renewable energy systems. Due to the fundamental advantages of POMs, such as the diversity of molecular structures and large numbers of redox active sites, numerous efforts have been devoted to extending their application areas. Up to now, various strategies of assembling POM molecules into superstructures, supporting POMs on heterogeneous substrates, and POMs&#8208;derived metal compounds have been developed for synthesizing electrocatalysts. From a multidisciplinary perspective, the latest advances in creating POM&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals, electrocatalytic roles, and the recent breakthroughs of POMs and POM&#8208;derived electrocatalysts, are systematically summarized. Notably, this paper focuses on exposing the current states, essences, and mechanisms of how POM&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities and discloses the critical requirements for future developments. The future challenges, objectives, comparisons, and perspectives for creating POM&#8208;structured materials are also systematically discussed. It is anticipated that this review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating interdisciplinary efforts for the prosperities and widespread utilizations of POM&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Facilitating Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Orbital Hybridization for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Marvelous Air Stability, Controllable High Voltage, and Anion Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on orbital hybridization theory, the challenges of layered oxide cathodes in terms of air stability, high voltage, anion redox chemistry, and improving the intrinsic characteristics through interactions between the 3d/4d transition metal and the O 2p atomic orbitals are summarized. This strategy of modulating orbitals hybridization will promote the development of sodium layered oxide cathodes and its commercialization process.








Abstract
Layered oxides have become the research focus of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low cost, simple synthesis process, and high specific capacity. However, the poor air stability, unstable phase structure under high voltage, and slow anionic redox kinetics hinder their commercial application. In recent years, the concept of manipulating orbital hybridization has been proposed to simultaneously regulate the microelectronic structure and modify the surface chemistry environment intrinsically. In this review, the hybridization modes between atoms in 3d/4d transition metal (TM) orbitals and O 2p orbitals near the region of the Fermi energy level (EF) are summarized based on orbital hybridization theory and first&#8208;principles calculations as well as various sophisticated characterizations. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms are explored from macro&#8208;scale to micro&#8208;scale, including enhancing air stability, modulating high working voltage, and stabilizing anionic redox chemistry. Meanwhile, the origin, formation conditions, and different types of orbital hybridization, as well as its application in layered oxide cathodes are presented, which provide insights into the design and preparation of cathode materials. Ultimately, the main challenges in the development of orbital hybridization and its potential for the production application are also discussed, pointing out the route for high&#8208;performance practical sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 15, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first introduces the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications. Then it identifies critical challenges in commercialization and corresponding solutions, including strategies for power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement over large areas, stability improvements, toxicity reduction, and so on. Finally, it includes some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future.








Abstract
Perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) devices are undergoing rapid development and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% at the cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light&#8208;related stability. Moreover, the solution&#8208;process nature makes the fabrication process of perovskite photovoltaic devices feasible and compatible with some mature high&#8208;volume manufacturing techniques. All these features render perovskite solar modules (PSMs) suitable for terawatt&#8208;scale energy production with a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In this review, the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications are first introduced. Then critical challenges are identified in their commercialization and propose the corresponding solutions, including developing strategies to realize high&#8208;quality films over a large area to further improve power conversion efficiency and stability to meet the commercial demands. Finally, some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future, mainly focusing on further dealing with toxicity and recycling of the whole device, and the attainment of highly efficient perovskite&#8208;based tandem modules, which can reduce the environmental impact and accelerate the LCOE reduction are put forwarded.

         <title>Emerging Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic spintronics has gained remarkable development in recent years. In this Perspective, the latest research progress in this field is reviewed. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can endow them with exotic properties for spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets constitute promising contender materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices with superior stability, scalability, and dynamics. Nevertheless, the perception of well&#8208;established ferromagnetic spintronics underpinned by spontaneous magnetization seemed to indicate the inadequacy of antiferromagnets for spintronics&#8212;their compensated magnetization has been perceived to result in uncontrollable antiferromagnetic order and subtle magnetoelectronic responses. However, remarkable advancements have been achieved in antiferromagnetic spintronics in recent years, with consecutive unanticipated discoveries substantiating the feasibility of antiferromagnet&#8208;centered spintronic devices. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can open up their endless possibilities of novel phenomena and functionality for spintronics. In this Perspective, the recent progress in antiferromagnetic spintronics is reviewed, with a particular focus on that based on several kinds of antiferromagnets with special antiferromagnetic crystal structures. The latest developments in efficiently manipulating antiferromagnetic order, exploring novel antiferromagnetic physical responses, and demonstrating prototype antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are discussed. An outlook on future research directions is also provided. It is hoped that this Perspective can serve as guidance for readers who are interested in this field and encourage unprecedented studies on antiferromagnetic spintronic materials, phenomena, and devices.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in 2D PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) is studied in 2D PtSe2 using THz emission. PtSe2 layers are grown epitaxially on graphene, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition resulting in well&#8208;defined atomic interfaces.The unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC: from the inverse RashbaEdelstein effect in the semiconducting layers to the inverse spin Hall effect in the semi&#8208;metallic state.








Abstract
2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field, or strain. Here, SCC in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission is studied since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8211;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE is demonstrated. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC as well as for the development of tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

         <title>Tailored Design of a Water&#8208;Based Nanoreactor Technology for Producing Processable Sub&#8208;40&#160;Nm 3D COF Nanoparticles at Atmospheric Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology that allows for the controlled generation of sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D covalent organic frameworks (COF) nanoparticles, boosting processability, and opening new frontiers in nano/microrobotics and biomedicine is presented. This breakthrough clearly overcomes the limitations posed by larger reported 3D COF crystal structures, unlocking exciting possibilities for previously unexplored domains.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress is made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions is presented. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architectured silicones comprising vitrimer and conventional elastomers are developed to simultaneously achieve creep resistance and autonomic self&#8208;heal at room temperature. Self&#8208;healing capabilities arise from dynamic dioxaborolane groups in the silicone vitrimer, whereas creep resistance emerges from the permanently crosslinked conventional elastomer. The potential of architectured silicones is illustrated by 3D printing a patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers for prospective applications in robotics and medicine.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers are printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage&#8208;resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self-heal or suffer from creep-induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self-healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self-healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep-resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient-specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers are printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage-resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers are prepared by impregnating porous delignified wood with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with a mismatched refractive index to enhance scattering. The fabrication of laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers is simple, environment&#8208;friendly, and rapid. This low&#8208;cost and highly efficient strategy can provide substantial energy savings and a basis for the application of natural wood in emerging laser diode lighting technology.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, a mismatched refractive index strategy is proposed to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has the potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolyte brushes prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization display pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric behavior. These properties are attributed to the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and depend on, and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing. 








Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Atmospheric Humidity Underlies Irreproducibility of Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric humidity control during the fabrication process crucially influences the phase formation and stability of formamidinium perovskites. This work reveals that controlled humidity during the fabrication process is a key to achieving reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films. Thus, precise humidity management is essential to ensure the reproducible, efficient, and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are infamous for their batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch and lab&#8208;to&#8208;lab irreproducibility in terms of stability and performance. Reproducible fabrication of PSCs is a critical requirement for market viability and practical commercialization. PSC irreproducibility plagues all levels of the community; from institutional research laboratories, start&#8208;up companies, to large established corporations. In this work, the critical function of atmospheric humidity to regulate the crystallization and stabilization of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the humidity content during processing induces profound variations in perovskite stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability, and optoelectronic quality. Almost counterintuitively, it is shown that the presence of humidity is perhaps indispensable to reproduce phase&#8208;stable and efficient FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Way to a Library of Ti&#8208;Series Oxide Nanofiber Sponges that are Highly Stretchable, Compressible, and Bendable</title>

A library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability are synthesized, which hold extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices.








Abstract
Ti&#8208;series oxide ceramics in the form of aerogels, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and CaCu3Ti4O12, hold tremendous potential as functional materials owing to their excellent optical, dielectric, and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, these inorganic aerogels are usually brittle and prone to pulverization owing to weak inter&#8208;particulate interactions, resulting in restricted application performance and serious health risks. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to synthesize an elastic form of an aerogel&#8208;like, highly porous structure, in which activity&#8208;switchable Ti&#8208;series oxide sols transform from the metastable state to the active state during electrospinning, resulting in condensation and solidification at the whipping stage to obtain curled nanofibers. These curled nanofibers are further entangled when flying in the air to form a physically interlocked, elastic network mimicking the microstructure of high&#8208;elasticity hydrogels. This strategy provides a library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability, possessing extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a new, elastic form of TiO2, composed of both &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; TiO2 nanofiber sponges, is constructed as spontaneous air&#8208;conditioning textiles in smart clothing, buildings, and vehicles, with unique bidirectional regulation of radiative cooling in summer and solar heating in winter.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with a Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postoperative implantable hydrogel sensor integrating a molecular beacon (MB) nanoprobe and fibroblasts is designed for visual detection and elimination of residual microtumors by ultrasensitive in situ monitoring of trace biomarkers, whose amplification of the signal is achieved by fibroblast&#8208;mediated local enrichment of tumor cells and spatially selective release of exonuclease I (exo I)&#8208;triggered biomarker recycling.








Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, a novel hydrogel sensor is designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detects the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1 in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identifies residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor is proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving &#8776;100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. This work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.








Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design&#8208;build&#8208;test&#8208;learn (DBTL) cycle, the modules are wired according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. A 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that can perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities is designed. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and can be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite membrane with an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and PFPE rubber is fabricated by PFPE precursor diffusion into electrolyte membrane backbone and curing process. The membrane increases the fatigue threshold by a factor of 2.5 compared to Nafion membranes. In the fuel cell test, the composite membrane exhibits a lifespan of 1.7 times longer than Nafion membranes.








Abstract
In a hydrogen fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane conducts protons, but blocks electrons, hydrogen molecules, and oxygen molecules. The fuel cell often runs unsteadily, resulting in fluctuating water production, causing the membrane to swell and contract. The cyclic deformation can cause fatigue crack growth. This paper describes an approach to develop a fatigue&#8208;resistant polymer electrolyte membrane. The membrane is prepared by forming an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and a rubber. The former conducts protons, and the latter enhances fatigue resistance. The introduction of the rubber modestly reduces electrochemical performance, but significantly increases fatigue threshold and lifespan. Compared to pristine plastic electrolyte, Nafion, an interpenetrating network of Nafion and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) reduces the maximum power density by 20%, but increases the fatigue threshold by 175%. Under the wet/dry accelerated stress test, the fuel cell with the Nafion&#8208;PFPE membrane has a lifespan 1.7 times that of a fuel cell with the Nafion membrane.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoid differentiation is largely conducted using biochemical signals to control cell differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signaling regulates nephrogenesis in kidney organoids is investigated. 3D encapsulation of differentiating kidney organoids in viscoelastic alginate hydrogels alters nephron patterning and morphology. These findings suggest that mechanical signaling is an important consideration for kidney regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8211;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz refractive sensing and fingerprint recognition within a continuous spectrum based on the coupling of surface waves. By covering 5 &#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz, and silicon nitride layers, the phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, this strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Hard Magnetic Graphene Nanocomposite for Multimodal, Reconfigurable Soft Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HMGN combines the advantages of porous conductive materials and hard magnetic materials to enable multimodal, reconfigurable soft electronics with magnetism&#8208;enhanced sensing performance and magnetism&#8208;assisted electrical interconnection, allowing for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage.








Abstract
Soft electronics provide effective means for continuous monitoring of a diverse set of biophysical and biochemical signals from the human body. However, the sensitivities, functions, spatial distributions, and many other features of such sensors remain fixed after deployment and cannot be adjusted on demand. Here, laser&#8208;induced porous graphene is exploited as the sensing material, and dope it with permanent magnetic particles to create hard magnetic graphene nanocomposite (HMGN) that can self&#8208;assemble onto a flexible carrying substrate through magnetic force, in a reversible and reconfigurable manner. A set of soft electronics in HMGN exhibits enhanced performances in the measurements of electrophysiological signals, temperature, and concentrations of metabolites. All these flexible HMGN sensors can adhere to a carrying substrate at any position and in any spatial arrangement, to allow for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage. The HMGN represents a promising material for constructing soft electronics that can be reconfigured for various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Adsorption on Magnetic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic helical aromatic hydrocarbons are sublimed in vacuo onto ferromagnetic cobalt nanoislands. Spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy on the single&#8208;molecule scale reveals that molecules of opposite handedness preferentially adsorb on islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. Enantioselection occurs in a transiently occupied physisorbed precursor state, suggesting that spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive interactions at the van der Waals level play a role.








Abstract
From the beginning of molecular theory, the interplay of chirality and magnetism has intrigued scientists. There is still the question if enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules occurs on magnetic surfaces. Enantiomer discrimination was&#160;conjectured to arise from chirality&#8208;induced spin separation within the molecules and exchange interaction with the substrate's magnetization. Here, it is shown that single helical aromatic hydrocarbons undergo enantioselective adsorption on ferromagnetic cobalt surfaces. Spin and chirality sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that molecules of opposite handedness prefer adsorption onto cobalt islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. As mobility ceases in the final chemisorbed state, it is concluded that enantioselection must occur in a physisorbed transient precursor state. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;resolved ab initio simulations support this scenario by refuting enantio&#8208;dependent chemisorption energies. These findings demonstrate that van der Waals interaction should also include spin&#8208;fluctuations which are crucial for molecular magnetochiral&#160;processes.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Capture through Ligand&#8208;Chain Interaction for the Regeneration of Depleted LiFePO4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the ligand chain within the Zn complex dynamically modulates the variational structure, enlarging the main framework of LFP and expediting the de&#8208;intercalation of Li+. This process revitalizes the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP, restoring them to levels comparable to that of newly produced LFP even under severe degradation conditions during the operation of regenerated batteries.








Abstract
After application in electric vehicles, spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are typically decommissioned. Traditional recycling methods face economic and environmental constraints. Therefore, direct regeneration has emerged as a promising alternative. However, irreversible phase changes can significantly hinder the efficiency of the regeneration process owing to structural degradation. Moreover, improper storage and treatment practices can lead to metamorphism, further complicating the regeneration process. In this study, a sustainable recovery method is proposed for the electrochemical repair of LFP batteries. A ligand&#8208;chain Zn&#8208;complex (ZnDEA) is utilized as a structural regulator, with its &#9472;NH&#9472; group alternatingly facilitating the binding of preferential transition metal ions (Fe3+ during charging and Zn2+ during discharging). This dynamic coordination ability helps to modulate volume changes within the recovered LFP framework. Consequently, the recovered LFP framework can store more Li&#8208;ions, enhance phase transition reversibility between LFP and FePO4 (FP), modify the initial Coulombic efficiency, and reduce polarization voltage differences. The recovered LFP cells exhibit excellent capacity retention of 96.30% after 1500 cycles at 2&#160;C. The ligand chain repair mechanism promotes structural evolution to facilitate ion migration, providing valuable insights into the targeted ion compensation for environmentally friendly recycling in practical applications.

         <title>Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phosphonic acid is developed to modify Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable device stability.








Abstract
High efficiency and long&#8208;term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non&#8208;uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic&#8208;acid structure, indolo(3,2&#8208;b)carbazole&#8208;5,11&#8208;diylbis(butane&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ&#8208;based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed similar to traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, including active material, conductive agent, and binder. Using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a hybrid target containing SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene, a thin&#8208;film SiOx&#8208;based composite electrode is successfully fabricated within plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). The SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film exhibits improved electronic conductivity, elasticity, and hardness compared to pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film shows remarkable cycling stability.








Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques is crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film is produced using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene. The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC (plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon) involves a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the PPFC matrix. This results in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibits an exceptional initial capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of miniaturized thin-film lithium-ion batteries (TF-LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques is crucial for low-scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, structures analogous to SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-based thin-film electrodes are designed with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin-film is produced using mid-frequency sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene. The thin-film SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/PPFC (plasma-polymerized fluorocarbon) involves a combination of SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and conductive carbon within the PPFC matrix. This results in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-based thin-film. The electrochemical performance of the half-cell consisting of thin-film SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/PPFC demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin-film as the cathode material exhibits an exceptional initial capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a stepping stone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF-LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8208;Site Co&#8208;Doping Coupled with Additive Passivation Pushes the Efficiency of Pb&#8211;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells with a record efficiency of 17.12% are achieved via B&#8208;site Mn co&#8208;doping strategy and introducing benzhydroxamic acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. Mn&#8208;doping contributes to structurally stable inorganic perovskite. While, BHA additive mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, and passivates Sn(II) related defects, forming an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite.








Abstract
Pb&#8211;Sn mixed inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increasing interest as a viable solution to mitigate the thermal instability and lead toxicity of hybrid lead&#8208;based PSCs. However, the relatively poor structural stability and low device efficiency hinder its further development. Herein, high&#8208;performance manganese (Mn)&#8208;doped Pb&#8211;Sn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are successfully developed by introducing Benzhydroxamic Acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. The incorporation of smaller divalent Mn cations contributes to a contraction of the perovskite crystal, leading to an improvement in structural stability. The BHA additive containing a reductive hydroxamic acid group (O&#9552;C&#8211;NHOH) not only mitigates the notorious oxidation of Sn2+ but also interacts with metal ions at the B&#8208;site and passivates related defects. This results in films with high crystallinity and low defect density. Moreover, the BHA molecules tend to introduce a near&#8208;vertical dipole moment that parallels the built&#8208;in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, the resulting device delivers a champion PCE as high as 17.12%, which represents the highest reported efficiency for Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the BHA molecule provides an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain boundary, resulting in significant enhancement of device air stability.

         <title>Piezoelectric Interlayer Enabling a Rechargeable Quasisolid&#8208;State Sodium Battery at 0&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric interlayer design between an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte and sodium metal is demonstrated to solve the interfacial issues against low&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. A piezoelectric ZnO layer proves a favorable interlayer with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, sufficient piezoelectricity to thoroughly reduce the interfacial resistance and promote a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell operating at a harsh condition of 0 &#176;C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) batteries (SSNBs) hold great promise but suffer from several major issues, such as high interfacial resistance at the solid electrolyte/electrode interface and Na metal dendrite growth. To address these issues, a piezoelectric interlayer design for an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolyte is proposed herein. Two typical piezoelectric films, AlN and ZnO, coated onto NZSP function as interlayers designed to generate a local stress&#8208;induced field for alleviating interfacial charge aggregation coupling stress concentration and promoting uniform Na plating. The results reveal that the interlayer (ZnO) with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, and sufficient piezoelectricity can provide a favorable interphase. Low interfacial resistances of 91 and 239 &#937; cm2 are achieved for the ZnO layer at 30 and 0&#160;&#176;C, respectively, which are notably lower than those for bare NZSP. Moreover, steady Na plating/stripping cycles are rendered over 850 and 4900&#160;h at 0 and 30&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The superior anodic performance is further manifested in an Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell which delivers discharge capacities of 125&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 1600 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 90&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 0&#160;&#176;C. A new interlayer&#8208;design insight is clearly demonstrated for SSNBs breaking low&#8208;temperature limits.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Electrocatalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free pathway for synthesizing metal&#8208;containing porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks (MPOR&#8208;COFs) is presented. The roles of synthetic conditions and the transition metals chelating with porphyrin are highlighted through both experimental and computational works. This study sets forth a unique approach to the synthesis and integration of electrocatalysts into electrode architectures, propelling applications into the cutting&#8208;edge realm.








Abstract
The inability to process many covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as thin films plagues their widespread utilization. Herein, a vapor&#8208;phase pathway for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a class of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs is presented. This approach allows integrating electrocatalysts made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;containing COFs into the electrodes&#8217; architectures in a single&#8208;step synthesis and deposition. By precisely controlling the metal sites at the atomic level, remarkable electrocatalytic performance is achieved, resulting in unprecedentedly high mass activity values. How the choice of metal atoms, i.e., cobalt and copper, can determine the catalytic activities of POR&#8208;COFs is demonstrated. The theoretical data proves that the Cu site is highly active for nitrate conversion to ammonia on the synthesized COFs.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.








Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers.

&lt;p&gt;This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in the Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral medications for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) encounter challenges of insufficient drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. A high&#8208;performance gold shell&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutic is constructed to achieve mucus penetration, improve wound healing, relieve oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses under transient mild photothermia. Oral hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating nanotherapeutics plus transient mild photothermia efficiently alleviates acute and chronic UC.








Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8776;42&#160;&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitates their penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Excitable AIE Small Molecule with Multimodal Phototheranostic Features for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR&#8208;II light activatable AIE small molecule with multimodal phototheranostic features is constructed for the first time by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility, as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. This molecule actualizes prominent NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8208;PTT synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics, referring to a single component simultaneously exhibiting multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities, has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in cancer treatment. Benefitting from the superiority in balancing the diverse competing energy dissipation pathways, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are proven to be ideal templates for constructing one&#8208;for&#8208;all multimodal phototheranostic agents. However, to this knowledge, the all&#8208;round AIEgens that can be triggered by a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) light have not been reported. Given the deep tissue penetration and high maximum permissible exposure of the NIR&#8208;II excitation light, herein, this work reports for the first time an NIR&#8208;II laser excitable AIE small molecule (named BETT&#8208;2) with multimodal phototheranostic features by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. As formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), the high performance of BETT&#8208;2 NPs in NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors is fully demonstrated by the systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations. This work offers valuable insights for developing NIR&#8208;II laser activatable one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic systems.

         <title>Efficient Thermo&#8208;Spin Conversion in van der Waals Ferromagnet FeGaTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermo&#8208;spin conversion has been found in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe. The unique thermoelectric property, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient, produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature. The maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient is found to reach 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 with a notable Nernst angle over 60%. 








Abstract
Recent discovery of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has spurred progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in enhancing the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency for building spin&#8208;logic or spin&#8208;memory devices. Here, the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects are systematically investigated to uncover significant spin&#8208;conversion effects in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anomalous Hall effect demonstrates an efficient electric spin&#8208;charge conversion with a notable spin Hall angle of over 6%. In addition, the anomalous Nernst effect produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature without a magnetic field, displaying unique temperature dependence with a maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient of 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 and a Nernst angle of &#8776;62%. Such an innovative thermoelectric signal arises from the efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion effect, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient. The present study highlights the potential of FeGaTe to enhance thermoelectric devices through efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion without the need for a magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Light Debondable Optically Clear Adhesives for Flexible Displays through Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Curing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;removable optically clear adhesive (OCA) is introduced, ideal for the sustainability&#8208;focused electronics industry, particularly for foldable devices requiring easy disassembly and robust, eco&#8208;friendly materials.








Abstract
With growing sustainability concerns, the need for products that facilitate easy disassembly and reuse has increased. Adhesives, initially designed for bonding, now face demands for selective removal, enabling rapid assembly&#8208;disassembly and efficient maintenance across industries. This need is particularly evident in the display industry, with the rise of foldable devices necessitating specialized adhesives. A novel optically clear adhesive (OCA) is presented for foldable display, featuring a unique UV&#8208;stimulated selective removal feature. This approach incorporates benzophenone derivatives into the polymer network, facilitating rapid debonding under UV irradiation. A key feature of this method is the adept use of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical polymerization for OCA film fabrication. This method shows remarkable compatibility with various monomers and exhibits orthogonal reactivity to benzophenone, rendering it ideal for large&#8208;scale production. The resultant OCA not only has high transparency and balanced elasticity, along with excellent resistance to repeated folding, but it also exhibits significantly reduced adhesion when exposed to UV irradiation. By merging this customized formulation with strategically integrated UV&#8208;responsive elements, an effective solution is offered that enhances manufacturing efficiency and product reliability in the rapidly evolving field of sustainable electronics and displays. This research additionally contributes to eco&#8208;friendly device fabrication, aligning with emerging technology demands.

         <title>How to Build Plasmon&#8208;Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular jackhammers (MJH) are a type of molecular machine driven by a molecular plasmon that converts photons into mechanical energy. The theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here these are quantified through an experimental plasmonicity index method. This method is utilized to understand how to improve plasmon&#8208;driven MJH for permeabilizing cellular membranes.








Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;driven molecular machines with ultrafast motion at the femtosecond scale are effective for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is recently shown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through vibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that causes the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted whole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here the use of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated plasmons in a broad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and cytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The characteristics of plasmon&#8208;driven molecular mechanical disassembly of supramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using real&#8208;time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in MJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method. This is done through the measurement of the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR spectra in various solvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the solvent polarity. Structure&#8208;activity relationships are used to optimize the synthesis of plasmon&#8208;driven MJH, applying them to eradicate human melanoma A375 cells at low lethal concentrations of 75&#160;nm and 80&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of 730&#160;nm NIR&#8208;light for 10&#160;min.

         <title>Observation of a Photonic Orbital Gauge Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step toward generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.








Abstract
Gauge field is widely studied in natural and artificial materials. With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena are observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices is first proposed and experimentally observed. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937; created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) l = 2 are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Rewritable Photoluminescence and Structural Color Display for Dual&#8208;Responsive Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independently and reliably manipulated in the thin polymer&#8208;based film. A rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display that has the benefit of direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye is presented, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Optical encryption using coloration and photoluminescent (PL) materials can provide highly secure data protection with direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information. Encryption capable of independently controlling wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration as well as variable light intensity PL is not adequately demonstrated yet. Herein, a rewritable PL and structural color (SC) display suitable for dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption developed with a stimuli&#8208;responsive SC of a block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) with alternating in&#8208;plane lamellae, of which a variety of 3D and 2D perovskite nanocrystals is preferentially self&#8208;assembled with characteristic PL, is presented. The SC of a BCP PC is controlled in the visible range with different perovskite precursor doping times. The perovskite nanocrystals developed in the BCP PC are highly luminescent, with a PL quantum yield of &#8776;33.7%, yielding environmentally stable SC and PL dual&#8208;mode displays. The independently programmed SC and PL information is erasable and rewritable. Dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption is demonstrated, in which true Morse code information is deciphered only when the information encoded by SCs is properly combined with PL information. Numerous combinations of SC and PL realize high security level of data anticounterfeiting. This dual&#8208;mode encryption display offers novel optical encryption with high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Localization of Cancer Cells for Subsequent Robust Photodynamic Therapy by ROS Responsive Polymeric Nanoparticles With Anti&#8208;Metastasis Complexes NAMI&#8208;A</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most cancer&#8208;related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple&#8208;negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non&#8208;resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen&#8208;dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti&#8208;metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI&#8208;A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.

         <title>Angular Engineering Strategy for Enhanced Surface Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Centrosymmetric Topological Semimetal HfGe0.92Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonlinearity is essential for integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. Topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te possesses a giant surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility and exhibits unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) based on an angular engineering strategy. Moreover, this high&#8208;performance SHG response is observed ranging from the visible to deep&#8208;UV regions because of the wide linear dispersion region around the Dirac points.








Abstract
Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic&#8208;layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, it is demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535 &#177; 308&#160;pm V&#8722;1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency is found to be up to 3.75&#8240;, which is 104 times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779&#160;nm) to the deep&#8208;UV region (257.5&#160;nm). This study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

         <title>Capacitive&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Scaffolds Offering Wireless In Situ Electrical Stimulation Promotes Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the capacitive coupling configuration, the electrostatic induction response of the chitosan/gelatin/black phosphorus conductive hydrogel implanted in the spinal cord injury lesion site can offer in situ electrical stimulation without any external metal stimulation electrodes and percutaneous electrical wirings. The capacitive coupling of high&#8208;frequency electrical field between hydrogel receiver and insulated metal patch transmitter can generate alternating current flowing in the hydrogel scaffold.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation (ES) has shown beneficial effects in repairing injured tissues. However, current ES techniques that use tissue&#8208;traversing leads and bulky external power suppliers have significant limitations in translational medicine. Hence, exploring noninvasive in vivo ES to provide controllable electrical cues in tissue engineering is an imminent necessity. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with in situ electrical generation capability as a biodegradable regeneration scaffold and wireless ES platform for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair is demonstrated. When a soft insulated metal plate is placed on top of the injury site as a wireless power transmitter, the conductive hydrogel implanted at the injury site can serve as a wireless power receiver, and the capacitive coupling between the receiver and transmitter can generate an alternating current in the hydrogel scaffold owing to electrostatic induction effect. In a complete transection model of SCI rats, the implanted conductive hydrogels with capacitive&#8208;coupling in situ ES enhance functional recovery and neural tissue repair by promoting remyelination, accelerating axon regeneration, and facilitating endogenous neural stem cell differentiation. This facile wireless&#8208;powered electroactive&#8208;hydrogel strategy thus offers on&#8208;demand in vivo ES with an adjustable timeline, duration, and strength and holds great promise in translational medicine.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By balancing injected electrons and holes, and electrically confining neutral excitons, WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing efficiency and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the 1D region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. These experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Surface&#8208;Mediated Mechanochemical Reaction for Rapid and Scalable Manufacture of Perovskite QD Phosphors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare highly luminescent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for the first time. PMR possesses distinctive features, including a high material utilization rate (100%), rapid synthesis (&#8776;100 s), mass production (synthesis rate of 1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), solvent&#8208;free, and remarkable versatility in preparing various perovskites, aligning with the ultimate goal of mechanochemistry: A clean, safe, and efficient solvent&#8208;free strategy.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered new&#8208;generation emitters for lighting and displays due to their high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, and pure color. However, their commercialization process is currently hindered by the challenge of mass production in a quick and environmentally friendly manner. In this study, a polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare perovskite QDs using a high&#8208;speed multifunction grinder for the first time. PMR possesses two distinctive features: i) The ultra&#8208;high rotating speed (&gt;15&#8239;000&#160;rpm) of the grinder facilitates the rapid conversion of the precursor to perovskite; ii) The surface&#8208;rich polymer particulate ensures QDs with high dispersity, avoiding QD aggregation&#8208;induced PL quenching. Therefore, PMR can successfully manufacture green perovskite QDs with a high PL quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 90% in a highly material&#8208; (100% yield), time&#8208; (1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), and effort&#8208; (solvent&#8208;free) efficient manner. Moreover, the PMR demonstrates remarkable versatility, including synthesizing by various polymers and producing diverse colored and Pb&#8208;free phosphors. Importantly, these phosphors featuring a combination of polymer and perovskite, are facilely processed into various solid emitters. The proposed rapid, green, and scalable approach has great potential to accelerate the commercialization of perovskite QDs.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis inside Double&#8208;Shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages with separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites are developed as nano reactors to trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides. These nanocages can serve as multifunctional sulfur hosts for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, guaranteeing admirable rate performance and high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8208;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8208;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8208;N4 and outer Zn&#8208;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8208;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Single-atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi-step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double-shelled nano-cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single-atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li-S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and outer Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li-S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proton Conductor for Fuel Cells with Flexible Operational Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A developed dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid exhibits efficient and stable proton conductivity over 80&#8211;160 &#176;C owing to the strong interaction between the two proton conductors and enhanced proton dissociation, enabling fuel cell operation with a flexible temperature range and excellent stability.








Abstract
The properties of proton conductors determine the operating temperature range of fuel cells. Typically, phosphoric acid (PA) proton conductors exhibit excellent proton conductivity owing to their high proton dissociation and self&#8208;diffusion abilities. However, at low temperatures or high current densities, water&#8208;induced PA loss causes rapid degradation of cell performance. Maintaining efficient and stable proton conductivity within a flexible temperature range can significantly reduce the start&#8208;up temperature of PA&#8208;doped proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of an organic phosphonic acid (ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, EDTMPA) and an inorganic PA is developed for proton exchange membranes. The proposed dual&#8208;proton conductor can operate within a flexible temperature range of 80&#8211;160 &#176;C, benefiting from the strong interaction between EDTMPA and PA, and the enhanced proton dissociation. Fuel cells with the EDTMPA&#8208;PA dual&#8208;proton conductor showed excellent cell stability at 80 &#176;C. In particular, under the high current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 160 &#176;C, the voltage decay rate of the fuel cell with the dual&#8208;proton conductor is one&#8208;thousandth of that of the fuel cell with PA&#8208;only proton conductor, indicating excellent stability.

         <title>Upconversion 3D Bioprinting for Noninvasive In Vivo Molding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel technique for creating implantable medical devices using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting. By converting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons into blue&#8211;violet emission, UCNPs enable in vivo polymerization without invasive surgery. Successful 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold demonstrates the potential of this method for biomedical treatment.








Abstract
Tissue engineered bracket materials provide essential support for the physiological protection and therapeutics of patients. Unfortunately, the implantation process of such devices poses the risk of surgical complications and infection. In this study, an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting approach is developed to realize in vivo molding that is free from invasive surgery. Reasonably designed UCNPs, which convert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons that penetrate skin tissues into blue&#8211;violet emission (300&#8211;500 nm), induce a monomer polymerization curing procedure in vivo. Using a fused deposition modeling coordination framework, a precisely predetermined trajectory of the NIR laser enables the manufacture of implantable medical devices with tailored shapes. A proof of the 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold is achieved successfully, thus demonstrating an entirely new method of in vivo molding for biomedical treatment.

         <title>Inhibition of Vanadium Cathodes Dissolution in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathode dissolution significantly limits the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, particularly at low currents. An artificial constructed on V6O13 cathodes (ZnOTf&#8208;LDH) is revealed to repel water, impede vanadium shuttling, and facilitate zinc transport. This suppresses vanadium dissolution and enables stable cycling for over 200 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1. The method is applicable to different vanadium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have experienced a rapid surge in popularity, as evident from the extensive research with over 30 000 articles published in the past 5 years. Previous studies on AZIBs have showcased impressive long&#8208;cycle stability at high current densities, achieving thousands or tens of thousands of cycles. However, the practical stability of AZIBs at low current densities (&lt;1C) is restricted to merely 50&#8211;100 cycles due to intensified cathode dissolution. This genuine limitation poses a considerable challenge to their transition from the laboratory to the industry. In this study, leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an artificial interphase that achieves both hydrophobicity and restriction of the outward penetration of dissolved vanadium cations, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium and suppressing the vanadium dissolution following Le Chatelier's principle, is described. The approach has resulted in one of the best cycling stabilities to date, with no noticeable capacity fading after more than 200 cycles (&#8776;720&#160;h) at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.47C). These findings represent a significant advance in the design of ultrastable cathodes for aqueous batteries and accelerate the industrialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reduced Lattice Constant in Al&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Nanoparticles for Boosted Electrochemical Lithium Extraction</title>

Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al&#8208;doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al&#8208;doped LMO (LiAl0.05Mn1.95O4, LMO&#8208;Al0.05) exhibits highercapacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li+ diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 obtains a Li+ intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh&#160;mol&#8722;1 Li+. Importantly, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 achieves a high Li+ extraction percentage (&#8776;86%) with Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine. The results demonstrate that the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Li2S Cathodes Enabled by an In Situ&#8208;Formed Li+ Conductor for Graphite&#8208;Li2S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed Li+ conductor (Li4SnS4) layer is directly constructed on commercial Li2S particles to obtain air&#8208;stable, shuttle&#8208;free, and fast&#8208;redox Li2S cathodes for graphite&#8208;Li2S batteries.








Abstract
Using Li2S cathodes instead of S cathodes presents an opportunity to pair them with Li&#8208;free anodes (e.g., graphite), thereby circumventing anode&#8208;related issues, such as poor reversibility and safety, encountered in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, the moisture&#8208;sensitive nature of Li2S causes the release of hazardous H2S and the formation of insulative by&#8208;products, increasing the manufacturing difficulty and adversely affecting cathode performance. Here, Li4SnS4, a Li+ conductor that is air&#8208;stable according to the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle, is formed in situ and uniformly on Li2S particles because Li2S itself participates in Li4SnS4 formation. When exposed to air (20% relative humidity), the protective Li4SnS4 layer maintains its components and structure, thus contributing to the enhanced stability of the Li2S@Li4SnS4 composite. In addition, the Li4SnS4 layer can accelerate the sluggish conversion of Li2S because of its favorable interfacial charge transfer, and continuously confine lithium polysulfides owing to its integrity during electrochemical processes. A graphite&#8208;Li2S pouch cell containing a Li2S@Li4SnS4 cathode is constructed, which shows stable cyclability with 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Hence, combining a desirable air&#8208;stable Li2S cathode and a highly reversible Li&#8208;free configuration offers potential practical applications of graphite&#8208;Li2S full cells.

         <title>In Situ Reconstruction of High&#8208;Entropy Heterostructure Catalysts for Stable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cr&#8208;induced in situ reconstruction strategy is proposed to construct robust FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts for highly stable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Benefiting from its desired electronic states, the FeCoNiMnCr HEA&#8208;HEO catalyst exhibits negligible activity loss under harsh industrial condition (6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C) at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. 








Abstract
Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, a successful in situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy is reported, and it is demonstrated that they deliver excellent ultrastable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 240&#160;h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 500&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Abstract
The first synthesis and comprehensive characterization of two vinyl tetrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF), TA&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and TA&#8208;COF&#8208;2, are reported. These materials exhibit high crystallinity and high specific surface areas of 1323 and 1114 m2 g&#8722;1. The COFs demonstrate favorable band positions and narrow band gaps suitable for light&#8208;driven applications. These advantages enable TA&#8208;COFs to act as reusable metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in the arylboronic acids oxidation and light&#8208;induced coupling of benzylamines. In addition, these TA&#8208;COFs show acid sensing capabilities, exhibiting visible and reversible color changes upon exposure to HCl&#160;solution, HCl vapor, and NH3 vapor. Further, the TA&#8208;COFs outperform a wide range of previously reported COF photocathodes. The tetrazine linker in the COF skeleton represents a significant advancement in the field of COF synthesis, enhancing the separation efficiency of charge carriers during the photoreaction and contributing to their photocathodic properties. TA&#8208;COFs can also degrade 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;one (NTO), an insensitive explosive present in industrial wastewater, in 20 min in a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic process; thus, revealing dual functionality of the protonated TA&#8208;COFs as both photodegradation and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts. This pioneering work opens new avenues for harnessing the potential of the tetrazine linker in COF&#8208;based materials, facilitating advances in catalysis, sensing, and other related fields.

Porifera&#8208;inspired lightweight, thin, wrinkle&#8208;resistant, and multifunctional MXene foam. Schematic illustration of the fabrication, structure, multifunction, and potential application of porifera&#8208;inspired MXene foam.








Abstract
Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) demonstrate a massive potential in constructing lightweight, multifunctional wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields for application in various fields. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop a facile, scalable approach to prepare the MXene&#8208;based macrostructures characterized by low density, low thickness, high mechanical flexibility, and high EMI SE at the same time. Herein, the ultrathin MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag foams with a porifera&#8208;inspired hierarchically porous microstructure are prepared by combining Zn2+ diffusion induction and hard template methods. The hierarchical porosity, which includes a mesoporous skeleton and a microporous MXene network within the skeleton, not only exerts a regulatory effect on stress distribution during compression, making the foams rubber&#8208;like resistant to wrinkling but also provides more channels for multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. Due to the interaction between Ag nanosheets, MXene/rGO, and porous structure, it is possible to produce an outstanding EMI shielding performance with the specific surface shielding effectiveness reaching 109152.4&#160;dB&#160;cm2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the foams exhibit multifunctionalities, such as transverse Joule heating, longitudinal heat insulation, self&#8208;cleaning, fire resistance, and motion detection. These discoveries open up a novel pathway for the development of lightweight MXene&#8208;based materials with considerable application potential in wearable electromagnetic anti&#8208;interference devices.

         <title>Electron Localization&#8208;Triggered Proton Pumping Toward Cu Single Atoms for Electrochemical CO2 Methanation of Unprecedented Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of electron transfer and directional *H transport enabled by electron localization is developed. VBi as an initiator can induce the electron localization at Cu single atoms, which enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 in single&#8208;atom Cu sites for electrocatalytic CH4 synthesis of unprecedented selectivity, apart from acting as active sites of H2O dissociation and pumping proton.








Abstract
Slow multi&#8208;proton coupled electron transfer kinetics and unexpected desorption of intermediates severely hinder the selectivity of CO2 methanation. In this work, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of pumping protons and improving adsorption configuration/capability enabled by electron localization is developed to be highly efficient for CH4 electrosynthesis over Cu single atoms anchored on bismuth vacancies of BiVO4 (Bi1&#8208;xVO4&#9472;Cu), with superior kinetic isotope effect and high CH4 Faraday efficiency (92%), far outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. Control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the bismuth vacancies (VBi) not only act as active sites for H2O dissociation but also induce electron transfer toward Cu single&#8208;atom sites. The VBi&#8208;induced electron localization pumps *H from VBi sites to Cu single atoms, significantly promoting the generation and stabilization of the pivotal intermediate (*CHO) for highly selective CH4 electrosynthesis. The metal vacancies as new initiators show enormous potential in the proton transfer&#8208;involved hydrogenative conversion processes.

         <title>Dynamic Transition between Monomer and Excimer Phosphorescence in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel phosphors are developed by the modification of dithienopyrrole, exhibiting efficient and persistent near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence. At low temperatures, excimer phosphorescence can be activated, enabled by the enhanced noncovalent interactions. With environmental variations, the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence is captured, establishing a framework to understand the photophysical mechanisms governing organic phosphorescence.








Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong nonradiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, is developed. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645 to 702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by noncovalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, the dynamic transition process is captured between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Excited state transitions across varying environments are elucidated, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Comparative Proteomics Inspired Self&#8208;Stimulated Release Hydrogel Reinforces the Therapeutic Effects of MSC&#8208;EVs on Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here an intelligent hydrogel containing self&#8208;assembled peptides that mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (MSC&#8208;EV) membrane enzymes can degrade is developed to allow controlled release of MSC&#8208;EVs after intranasal delivery, prolonging their retention and improving their ability to cure Alzheimer's disease. This study introduces a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven hydrogel design, offering promising modality for MSC&#8208;EVs&#8217; clinical applications.









Abstract
The clinical application of extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#8208;based therapeutics continues to be challenging due to their rapid clearance, restricted retention, and low yields. Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self&#8208;stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self&#8208;assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC&#8208;EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo&#8208;sensitive release of MSC&#8208;EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC&#8208;EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research presents a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven approach to intelligent hydrogel design, which holds the capacity to significantly enhance the applicability of EVs in clinical settings.

         <title>Light and Magnetism Orchestrating Aquatic Pollutant&#8208;Degradation Robots in Programmable Trajectories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film&#8208;confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.








Abstract
Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant&#8208;removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled iron oxide&#8208;bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&#8722;1 within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light&#8208;triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity. This strategy developed here provides guidelines for the explorations of high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>ACE2 Receptor&#8208;Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.








Abstract
Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor&#8208;binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug&#8208;targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE&#8208;AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation&#8208;delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild&#8208;type and mutant viruses. The RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (TPCA&#8208;1&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice. This smart combination provides a new choice for dealing with possible emergencies in the future and for the rapid development of inhaled drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases.

         <title>Delineating the Impact of Transition&#8208;Metal Crossover on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation with Ion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals that cross over from the cathode and deposit on the lithium&#8208;metal anode during high&#8208;voltage cycling (4.6&#160;V) are shown to localize solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and lithium deposition on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes through advanced, high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMB) employing cobalt&#8208;free layered&#8208;oxide cathodes are a sustainable path forward to achieving high energy densities, but these cathodes exhibit substantial transition&#8208;metal dissolution during high&#8208;voltage cycling. While transition&#8208;metal crossover is recognized to disrupt solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite anodes, experimental evidence is necessary to demonstrate this for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, advanced high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis is conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) to establish spatial correlations between the transition metals and electrolyte decomposition products found on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Insights into the localization of various chemistries linked to crucial processes that define LMB performance, such as lithium deposition, SEI growth, and transition&#8208;metal deposition are deduced from a precise elemental and spatial analysis of the SEI. Heterogenous transition&#8208;metal deposition is found to perpetuate both heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium deposition on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. These correlations are confirmed across various lithium&#8208;metal anodes that are cycled with different cobalt&#8208;free cathodes and electrolytes. An advanced electrolyte that is stable to higher voltages is shown to minimize transition&#8208;metal crossover and its effects on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining uniform SEI coverage on lithium&#8208;metal anodes, which is disrupted by transition&#8208;metal crossover during operation at high voltages.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;clogging and poor O2 diffusion restrict the output power and capacity of sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Here, by using 3D&#8208;printing techniques, the impact of porous structures and pore sizes on O2 diffusion in sodium&#8208;oxygen cells is studied. An electrode is 3D printed with progressively branching gas channels to balance O2 diffusion and product storage, which shows a high output power and capacity.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D&#8208;printing technology is adopted to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries toward practical applications.

         <dc:description>
Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host benefits the dendrite&#8208;free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d&#8208;band&#8208;center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p&#8208;band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite&#8208;free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn/S&#8208;PANI full cell also shows a robust long&#8208;term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C may open up their application for the dendrite&#8208;free metal anode.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High Thermal Insulating Porous High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics up to 2000&#160;&#176;C</title>

A multiscale design strategy is proposed to fabricate 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diborides (9PHEBs) with exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulating performance via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique. The as&#8208;fabricated 9PHEBs possess ultrahigh compressive strength (&#8776;337 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.76 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). More importantly, they show superior thermal stability and strength retention up to 2000 &#176;C.








Abstract
High mechanical load&#8208;carrying capability and thermal insulating performance are crucial to thermal&#8208;insulation materials under extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics. Here, for the first time, it is reported a multiscale structure design and fast fabrication of 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diboride ceramics via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique that can lead to exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulation performance. With the construction of multiscale structures involving ultrafine pores at the microscale, high&#8208;quality interfaces between building blocks at the nanoscale, and severe lattice distortion at the atomic scale, the materials with an &#8776;50% porosity exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength of up to &#8776;337&#160;MPa at room temperature and a thermal conductivity as low as &#8776;0.76&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. More importantly, they demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, with merely &#8776;2.4% volume shrinkage after 2000&#160;&#176;C annealing. They also show an ultrahigh compressive strength of &#8776;690&#160;MPa up to 2000&#160;&#176;C, displaying a ductile compressive behavior. The excellent mechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Ionic Polyimine&#8208;Based Composite Membrane with Inductive and Complexation Synergistic Effects for Sensitive and On&#8208;Site Fluorescent Detection of Volatile Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concerns about radioactive iodine emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage are raised. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;based method using an ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone composite membrane is developed for on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by utilizing ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions and complexation effects for iodine enrichment and immobilization. The resulting membrane shows rapid response time and low detection limit.








Abstract
Along with the development of nuclear power, concerns about radioactive emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage have been widely raised, particularly of harmful iodine isotopes. However, as a significant component of nuclear air waste, the enrichment and detection of air&#8208;dispersed gaseous iodine remain a challenge. In this work, it is focused on developing an attraction&#8208;immobilization&#8208;detection strategy&#8208;based fluorescence method for the on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by employing a photoluminescent ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone (IPIN&#8208;PVP) composite membrane. This strategy synergizes ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions from IPIN and complexation effects from PVP, allowing effective iodine enrichment and immobilization. As a result, the optimized IPIN&#8208;PVP membrane exhibits rapid response times of 5 s and a low detection limit of 4.087 &#215; 10&#8722;8&#160;m for gaseous iodine. It also introduces a portable handheld detection device that utilizes the composite membrane, offering a practical solution for real&#8208;time on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine. This innovation enhances nuclear safety measures and disaster management by providing rapid and reliable iodine detection capabilities.

         <title>Injectable MSC Spheroid and Microgel Granular Composites for Engineering Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.








Abstract
Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly&#8208;sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long&#8208;term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.

         <title>Defect Engineering of 2D Semiconductors for Dual Control of Emission and Carrier Polarity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations, a general defect engineering strategy is designed to eliminate the negative influence of defects in 2D TMDCs monolayers and achieve the desired optoelectronic properties. The doped samples simultaneously achieve giant PL/PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Further constructed p&#8208;n homojunctions also shows excellent device performance. 








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising materials in post&#8208;Moore technology. However, the low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and single carrier polarity due to the inevitable defects during material preparation are great obstacles to their practical applications. Here, an extraordinary defect engineering strategy is reported based on first&#8208;principles calculations and realize it experimentally on WS2 monolayers by doping with IIIA atoms. The doped samples with large sizes possess both giant PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Surprisingly, the high PL emission maintained even after one year under ambient environment. Moreover, the constructed p&#8211;n homojunctions shows high rectification ratio (&#8776;2200), ultrafast response times and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the doping strategy is universally applicable to other TMDCs and dopants. This smart defect engineering strategy not only provides a general scheme to eliminate the negative influence of defects, but also utilize them to achieve desired optoelectronic properties for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Evolution of Grain Boundaries Promoted Hydrogen Production for Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of grain boundaries via Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo) leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density (0.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.12 V), which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density, is successfully driven. The optimal MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo demonstrates ultrahigh current density (&gt;2 A cm&#8722;2) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;m KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects lead to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell is also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of grain boundaries via Cu-mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu-BNiMo) leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) in industrial-grade current density (0.5 A cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.12 V), which is nearly five-fold that of the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and durable high-current-density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large-scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu-mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu-BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial-grade current density, is successfully driven. The optimal MCu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;-BNiMo demonstrates ultrahigh current density (&amp;gt;2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that MCu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;-BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects lead to the enhanced HER performance of MCu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;-BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;-BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell is also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five-fold that of the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. The strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial-scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds&#8208;Pinned Entanglement Blunting the Interfacial Crack of Hydrogel&#8211;Elastomer Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a universal strategy to blunt the interfacial crack propagation by bonding a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomer. Such a unique strategy fulfills the hydrogel coating with excellent interfacial toughness and interfacial fatigue threshold, ensuring long&#8208;term durable aqueous lubrication with a low friction coefficient.








Abstract
Anchoring a layer of amorphous hydrogel on an antagonistic elastomer holds potential applications in surface aqueous lubrication. However, the interfacial crack propagation usually occurs under continuous loads for amorphous hydrogel, leading to the failure of hydrogel interface. This work presents a universal strategy to passivate the interfacial cracks by designing a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomers. The unique Hb&#8211;En structure is created by pinning well&#8208;tailored entanglements via covalent&#8208;like hydrogen bonds, which can amplify the delocalization of interfacial stress concentration and elevate the necessary fracture energy barrier within hydrogel interface. Therefore, the interfacial crack propagation can be suppressed under single and cyclic loads, resulting in a high interfacial toughness over 1650 J m&#8722;2 and an excellent interfacial fatigue threshold of 423 J m&#8722;2. Such a strategy universally works on blunting the interfacial crack between hydrogel coating and various elastomer materials with arbitrary shapes. The superb fatigue&#8208;crack insensitivity at the interface allows for durable aqueous lubrication of hydrogel coating with low friction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Pyroptosis Inducer: Optimizing the Catalytic Microenvironment of Nanozymes by Membrane&#8208;Adhered Microbe Enables Potent Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer to optimize catalytic performance of nanozyme by the respiration of membrane&#8208;adhered microbe, which induces eruptive ROS to trigger pyroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer will motivate the development of self&#8208;adaptive nano&#8208;catalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy and provide new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has garnered increasing attention in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, increasing plasma membrane damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an effective strategy for promoting pyroptosis. However, the current tactics for enhancing membrane rupture in pyroptosis are limited by the inherent drawbacks of ROS and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer (LPZ) is designed by integrating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and an enzyme&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework to achieve potent pyroptosis immunotherapy. LPZ can adhere to cancer cell membranes through the interaction between the pili of LGG and the mucin of cancer cells. In particular, the adaptive formula can gradually enhance the ability of nanozymes to produce ROS by creating an acidic microenvironment through anaerobic respiration. These results verify that LPZ could generate high levels of ROS both on the membrane and within cancer cells, leading to pyroptotic cell death and strong antitumor immunity. Meanwhile, LGG are eventually killed by ROS in this process to halt their respiration and prevent potential biosafety concerns. Overall, this work provides new inspiration for the design of self&#8208;adaptive nanocatalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Biphasic GaIn Alloy Constructed Stable Percolation Network in Polymer Composites over Ultrabroad Temperature Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;eutectic biphasic design of GaIn alloy not only maintains the conductive network integrity at a wide temperature range (77&#8211;473 K) by phase transitions of liquid Ga and solid In but also addresses the widespread leakage problem. This work provides a feasible indication of conductive composites for applications in extreme temperature applications.








Abstract
Flexible and adaptable polymer composites with high&#8208;performance reliability over wide temperature range are imperative for various applications. However, the distinct filler&#8208;matrix thermomechanical behaviors often cause severe structure damage and performance degradation upon large thermal shock. To address this issue, a general strategy is proposed to construct leakage&#8208;free, self&#8208;adaptive, stable percolation networks in polymer composites over wide temperature (77&#8211;473 K) with biphasic Ga35In65 alloy. The in situ micro&#8208;CT technology, for the first time, reveals the conformable phase transitions of Ga35In65 alloys in the polymer matrix that help repair the disruptive conductive networks over large temperature variations. The cryo&#8208;expanded Ga compensates the disruptive carbon networks at low temperatures, and flowable Ga and melted In at high temperatures conformably fill and repair the deboned interfaces and yielded crevices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this temperature&#8208;resistant composite demonstrates superb electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding properties and stability even after a large temperature shock (&#916;T = 396 K). Furthermore, the superiority of the construction of temperature self&#8208;adaptive networks within the composite enables them for additive manufacturing of application&#8208;oriented components. This work offers helpful inspiration for developing high&#8208;performance polymer composites for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Protein&#8208;Escaping Dyes Enable High&#8208;Contrast and Long&#8208;Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much&#8208;enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low&#8208;quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long&#8208;term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR&#8208;I/II&#160;Cl&#8208;containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein&#8208;escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein&#8208;escaping probes that achieve dual&#8208;excitation (808 and 1064&#160;nm) interference&#8208;free imaging of nerve&#8208;vessel and tumor&#8208;vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein&#8208;escaping dyes enable long&#8208;term repeatable dual&#8208;color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor&#8208;vessel reconstruction at the wound site.

         <title>Broken Inversion Symmetry in Van Der Waals Topological Ferromagnetic Metal Iron Germanium Telluride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Definitive evidence for inversion symmetry breaking in iron germanium telluride (FGT) is reported using second harmonic generation (SHG). Fe&#160;deficiency and temperature&#160;dependent SHG evolution conclude that Fe vacancies break the inversion symmetry and reduce the centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1. These findings add crucial new information to understanding FGT: band topology, intrinsic spin&#160;orbit torque, skyrmion, and topological polar metal states.








Abstract
Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin&#8208;orbit torque, which is crucial for next&#8208;generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque is established in the topological van der Waals&#160;(vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique is reported. The data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the threefold SHG pattern with dominant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp threefold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to the understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque, and topological vdW polar metal states.

Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2309183, Ji&#8208;Won Jung, Sang&#8208;Jin Lee, Hyun&#8208;Suk Kim, and co&#8208;workers focus on developing miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs), specifically addressing the challenge of low energy density in these batteries. The study introduces an innovative design for SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, closely resembling traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, which include an active material, a conductive agent, and a binder. A key innovation of this research is the use of mid&#8208;frequency (MF) sputtering to create a singular hybrid thin&#8208;film composed of SiOx nanoparticles, several conductive agents, and a strong binder made of plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). Our design, which is analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, proposes a new approach to TF&#8208;LIB fabrication.

Optical Encryption
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independent and reliably manipulated in a rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display based on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly. The display has the benefit of being a direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. More details can be found in article number 2310130 by Cheolmin Park and co&#8208;workers.

SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2
In article number 2311537 by Jincun Zhao, Xun Sun, and co&#8208;workers, a specific ACE2&#8208;binding peptide with a superior antiviral activity was identified and used to modified the inhaled nanoemulsions. The inhaled remdesivir nanoemulsions strongly inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 not only by blocking the binding of virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restricting virus replication intracellularly.

3D COF Nanoparticles
In article number 2306345, Carlos Franco, Salvador Pan&#233;, Josep Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis, and co&#8208;workers present a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology that pioneers the creation of sub&#8208;40 nm 3D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles under ambient conditions. This method not only improves the processability of 3D COFs but also unveils exciting possibilities in microrobotics. A notable achievement is the fabrication of the first COF&#8208;based microrobots (COFBOTs).

Information&#8208;Processing Materials
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The biomolecular decoder is programmed to convert specific binary molecular inputs into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and sensor signal processing. More details can be found in article number 2308092 by Wilfried Weber and co&#8208;workers.

Electrically Confined Electroluminescence
In article number 2310498, Gwan&#8208;Hyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers demonstrate electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By achieving balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, and confining neutral exciton within the 1D region, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2% at room temperature, which will be a promising approach to enhancing the EQE and modulating exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.

Orbital Gauge Field
In article number 2310010, Xian&#8208;Min Jin and co&#8208;workers realize an orbital gauge field to transmit high&#8208;dimensional quantum states. The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step towards generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.

         <title>Features of Anisotropic Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to micron sized particles or capsules, including non&#8208;spherical shape, loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems for fabrication are under discussion.








Abstract
Natural materials are anisotropic. Delivery systems occurring in nature, such as viruses, blood cells, pollen, and many others, do have anisotropy, while delivery systems made artificially are mostly isotropic. There is apparent complexity in engineering anisotropic particles or capsules with micron and submicron sizes. Nevertheless, some promising examples of how to fabricate particles with anisotropic shapes or having anisotropic chemical and/or physical properties are developed. Anisotropy of particles, once they face biological systems, influences their behavior. Internalization by the cells, flow in the bloodstream, biodistribution over organs and tissues, directed release, and toxicity of particles regardless of the same chemistry are all reported to be factors of anisotropy of delivery systems. Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to particles or capsules, including loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties primarily by anisotropic magnetic properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems and limitations for fabrication are under discussion.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance Conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights the contribution of multifunctional nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and influence of their microscale biomaterial architecture on the nerve repairment. Chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, anisotropic assembly microstructure, electroactivity and magnetic&#8208;sensitivity are expected to be pioneering features in the effective NGCs. The biosafety assessment and clinical trials of multifunctional NGCs are urgently required before the commercial application.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with advanced architectures are also proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogenous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs are also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies, and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as novel material paradigms with intrinsic ferroic behaviors. This review summarizes the fundamentals and design strategies of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and ferromagnetism in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites, and also discusses the underlying mechanisms of their multiferroic and magnetoelectric properties. The potential implementation in multilevel ferroic modulation, chirality as well as spin orbitronics is also presented.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the coexistence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multilevel ferroic modulation,&#160;chiral spin textures,&#160;and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building upon the established chelate and macrocyclic effects, supramolecular chemists have exploited the mechanical bond to create selective supramolecular hosts with enhanced binding affinities and selectivity over non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocyclic host analogs. This review delineates advantages of mechanically interlocked hosts for charged species, and discusses current and potential applications of the mechanical bond effect for recognition and sensing applications.








Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection, and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

         <title>Memristor&#8208;Based Neuromorphic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Additionally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.








Abstract
In the era of information, characterized by an exponential growth in data volume and an escalating level of data abstraction, there has been a substantial focus on brain&#8208;like chips, which are known for their robust processing power and energy&#8208;efficient operation. Memristors are widely acknowledged as the optimal electronic devices for the realization of neuromorphic computing, due to their innate ability to emulate the interconnection and information transfer processes witnessed among neurons. This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Subsequently, a thorough discussion of the memristor array, which serves as the pivotal component of the neuromorphic chip, as well as an examination of the present mainstream neural networks, is delved. Furthermore, the design of the neuromorphic chip is categorized into three crucial sections, including synapse&#8208;neuron cores, networks on chip (NoC), and neural network design. Finally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.

         <title>From Liquid to Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides as Emerging Cathodes with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospects for commercialization of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs with high energy density are highly encouraging, which will develop new opportunities to overcome the energy density and safety limitations of conventional liquid batteries. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary efforts are expected to overcome omni&#8208;direction challenges and propel LRMO cathodes toward practical applications in ASSBs significantly.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRMO) cathode materials have attracted widespread attention due to their high specific capacity, energy density, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as poor cycling stability, voltage deca,y and oxygen escape limit their commercial application in liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of safe and resilient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), driven by their remarkable safety features and superior energy density. ASSBs based on LRMO cathodes offer distinct advantages over conventional liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries, including long&#8208;term cycle stability, thermal and wider electrochemical windows stability, as well as the prevention of transition metal dissolution. This review aims to recapitulate the challenges and fundamental understanding associated with the application of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs. Additionally, it proposes the mechanisms of interfacial mechanical and chemical instability, introduces noteworthy strategies to enhance oxygen redox reversibility, enhances high&#8208;voltage interfacial stability, and optimizes Li+ transfer kinetics. Furthermore, it suggests potential research approaches to facilitate the large&#8208;scale implementation of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Undercoordination Chemistry of Sulfur Electrocatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research advances of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis including operation strategy and underlying working mechanisms are systematically combed in this review. Underlying working mechanisms are detailedly summarized in terms of polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives regarding the future of undercoordination chemistry are proposed.








Abstract
Undercoordination chemistry is an effective strategy to modulate the geometry&#8208;governed electronic structure and thereby regulate the activity of sulfur electrocatalysts. Efficient sulfur electrocatalysis is requisite to overcome the sluggish kinetics in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries aroused by multi&#8208;electron transfer and multi&#8208;phase conversions. Recent advances unveil the great promise of undercoordination chemistry in facilitating and stabilizing sulfur electrochemistry, yet a related review with systematicness and perspectives is still missing. Herein, it is carefully combed through the recent progress of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis. The typical material structures and operational strategies are elaborated, while the underlying working mechanism is also detailly introduced and generalized into polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives on the future development of undercoordination chemistry are further proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in copper&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable production of valuable fuels and chemicals via electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions are summarized. The rational design of metallic copper, compounds, alloys, composites, and single&#8208;atom catalysts results in efficient electroreduction of substrates to valorized alkenes, alcohols, ammonia, amines, urea, and so on. The current issues and future opportunities in this area are provided.








Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among the various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products is focused. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, and C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Personalized Cancer Nanomedicine: Overcoming Biological Barriers for Intracellular Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discovers how RNA and 
mAbs&#160;are shaping the future of personalized cancer nanomedicine. This also dives into the current landscape and nanotechnology's battle with protein corona phenomena, explores strategies for enhanced tumor access and penetration, and confronts the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must conquer to reach intracellular domains. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and potential prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. This review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.

         <title>Molecular Engineering toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and proposes a variety of design principles. Various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively and systematically summarized to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs for lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively summarized and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs are provided. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI is discussed and corresponding design principles are proposed, which are beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>Bypassing the Single Junction Limit with Advanced Photovoltaic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian optimization&#8208;based simulation framework is presented, able to perform virtual optimization of multi&#8208;junction solar cell architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Vertical and lateral architectures are proposed to surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion.








Abstract
Multijunction devices and photon up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion are prominent concepts aimed at increasing photovoltaic efficiencies beyond the single junction limit. Integrating these concepts into advanced architectures may address long&#8208;standing issues such as processing complexity, microstructure control, and resilience against spectral changes of the incoming radiation. However, so far, no models have been established to predict the performance of such integrated architectures. Here, a simulation environment based on Bayesian optimization is presented, that can predict and virtually optimize the electrical performance of multi&#8208;junction architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi&#8208;junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.

Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine-learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi-junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Ultrathin Alloy Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)/fcc heterophase is well achieved. Notably, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate superior catalytic performance toward nitrate electroreduction to ammonia than hcp/fcc RuMo NFs. Mechanism studies reveal that crystal phase engineering of RuMo alloy nanostructures can significantly improve the electroactivity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) toward ammonia synthesis is recognized as a sustainable strategy to balance the global nitrogen cycle. However, it still remains a great challenge to achieve highly efficient ammonia production due to the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process in NO3RR. Here, the controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed/fcc heterophase for highly efficient NO3RR is reported. Significantly, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate high Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% and a large yield rate of 32.7&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 toward ammonia production at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have unraveled that fcc RuMo NFs possess the highest d&#8208;band center with superior electroactivity, which originates from the strong Ru&#9472;Mo interactions and the high intrinsic activity of the unconventional fcc phase. The optimal electronic structures of fcc RuMo NFs supply strong adsorption of key intermediates with suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution, which further determines the remarkable NO3RR performance. The successful demonstration of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries with fcc RuMo NFs suggests their substantial application potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.
