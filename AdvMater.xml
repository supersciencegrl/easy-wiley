         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Trap Energy Upconversion&#8208;Like Near&#8208;Infrared to Near&#8208;Infrared Light Rejuvenateable Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to NIR light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. These materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus they can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons.








Abstract
Persistent&#8208;luminescence phosphors (PLPs) have a wide variety of applications in the fields of photonics and biophotonics due to their ultralong afterglow lifetime. However, the existing PLPs are charged and recharged with short&#8208;wavelength high&#8208;energy photons or inconvenient and potentially risky X&#8208;ray beams. To date, deep tissue penetrable NIR light has mainly been used for photostimulated afterglow emission, which continues to decay and weaken after each cycle, Herein, a new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to near&#8208;infrared light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. In contrast to the existing PLPs and persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles, the materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus these new materials can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons, which is unable to be done for existing PLPs, and emit afterglow signals. This conceptual work will lay the foundation to design new categories of NIR&#8208;absorptive&#8211;NIR&#8208;emissive PLPs and nanoparticles featuring physically harmless and deep tissue penetrable NIR light renewability and sets the stage for numerous biological applications, which have been limited by current materials.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of the organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous.

&lt;/i&gt; perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

         <title>Perovskite Quantum Dots with Ultralow Trap Density by Acid Etching&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for High Luminance and Stable Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable small&#8208;sized CsPbBr3 quantum dots obtained by a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange exhibit the blue emission (470&#160;nm) with record luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and long&#8208;term operational stability of 12 h.








Abstract
The research on metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure&#8208;blue (&#8776;470&#160;nm wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure&#8208;blue emitting small&#8208;sized (&#8776;4&#160;nm) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density and excellent stability.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable small&#8208;sized CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots obtained by a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange exhibit the blue emission (470&#160;nm) with record luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and long&#8208;term operational stability of 12 h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research on metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure&#8208;blue (&lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;470&#160;nm wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure&#8208;blue emitting small&#8208;sized (&lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;4&#160;nm) CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density and excellent stability. The acid, hydrogen bromide (HBr), is employed to etch imperfect [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedrons, thereby removing surface defects and excessive carboxylate ligands. Subsequently, didodecylamine and phenethylamine are successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites of the QDs and attain in situ exchange with the original long&#8208;chain organic ligands, resulting in near&#8208;unity quantum yield (97%) and remarkable stability.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Wetting&#8208;Front Transient Heat Release on a Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber papers. As a potential disruption to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, the study shows promise for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices.








Abstract
Transient heat generation during guest adsorption and host&#8211;guest interactions is a natural phenomenon in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) chemistry. However, in situ tracking of such MOF released heat is an insufficiently researched field due to the fast heat dissipation to the surroundings. Herein, a facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber substrates. Spatiotemporal temperature distributions are obtained with infrared thermal imaging for a range of MOF&#8208;based substrates and imbibed liquids. Temperature rises at the wetting front of water and binary mixtures with organic solvents are found to be over 10&#160;K with an ultrafast and distinguishable thermal signal response (&lt;1 s) with a detectable concentration limit &#8804;1 wt%. As a an advancement to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, this study shows great prospects for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices. Inspired by this prototypal study, SURMOF&#8208;based transient heat signal transduction is likely to be extended to an ever&#8208;expanding library of SURMOFs and other classes of surface&#8208;grafted porous materials, translating into a wide range of convenient, portable, and ubiquitous sensor devices.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Beyond the Visible: Bioinspired Infrared Adaptive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. This review provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art account on emerging bioinspired infrared adaptive materials and their potential applications. The perspectives for future scope, challenges and opportunities on such a multidisciplinary topic are outlined.








Abstract
Infrared (IR) adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. Taking inspiration from natural creatures, researchers have devoted extensive efforts for developing advanced IR adaptive materials and exploring their applications in areas of smart camouflage, thermal energy management, biomedical science, and many other IR&#8208;related technological fields. Herein, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is provided on the recent advancements of bioinspired IR adaptive materials and their promising applications. First an overview of IR adaptation in nature and advanced artificial IR technologies is presented. Recent endeavors are then introduced toward developing bioinspired adaptive materials for IR camouflage and IR radiative cooling. According to the Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann law, IR camouflage can be realized by either emissivity engineering or thermal cloaks. IR radiative cooling can maximize the thermal radiation of an object through an IR atmospheric transparency window, and thus holds great potential for use in energy&#8208;efficient green buildings and smart personal thermal management systems. Recent advances in bioinspired adaptive materials for emerging near&#8208;IR (NIR) applications are also discussed, including NIR&#8208;triggered biological technologies, NIR light&#8208;fueled soft robotics, and NIR light&#8208;driven supramolecular nanosystems. This review concludes with a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for the future development of bioinspired IR adaptive materials.

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Electronic Conductive Inorganic Cathodes Promising High&#8208;Energy Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excessive inactive carbon in organic electrode materials (OEMs) is substituted by electronic conductive inorganic cathode materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, as well as strong affinity to OEMs. The strategy simultaneously achieves high capacities, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy densities.








Abstract
The electrochemical utilization of organic electrode materials (OEMs) is highly dependent on an excess amount of inactive carbon at the expense of low packing density and energy density. In this work, the challenges by substituting inactive carbon with electronic conductive inorganic cathode (ECIC) materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons for redox reactions of the whole electrodes, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, and strong affinity with OEMs to inhibit their dissolution, are addressed. Combining representative ECICs (TiS2 and Mo6S8) with organic electrode materials (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN)) simultaneously achieves high capacity, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy density. High gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 153&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 200&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 are delivered with superior cycling stability in a 30 mA h&#8208;level Li/PTCDA&#8208;TiS2 pouch cell. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of organic&#8211;ECIC electrodes is also successfully demonstrated in monovalent Na, divalent Mg, and trivalent Al batteries, indicating their feasibility and generalizability. With the discovery of more ECIC materials and OEMs, it is anticipated that the proposed organic&#8211;ECIC system can result in further improvements at cell level to compete with transition metal&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bioinspired Spiky Peroxidase&#8208;Mimics for Localized Bacterial Capture and Synergistic Catalytic Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired, spiky, and highly catalytic&#8208;active virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; eradication of pathogenic bacteria. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M exhibits strong bacterial interactions and efficient capture, synergistic catalytic sterilization, and similar in vivo disinfection efficiency to that of vancomycin, which provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.








Abstract
Besides the pandemic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many other pathogenic microbes also pose a devastating threat to human health, for instance, pathogenic bacteria. Due to the lack of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; action of bacteriophages, a virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO3, can serve as a peroxo&#8208;complex&#8208;intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H2O2, which mainly benefits the generation of &#8226;OH radicals. The unique virus&#8208;like spikes endow the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 &#181;g mL&#8211;1). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V&#8208;POD&#8208;M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V&#8208;POD&#8208;M provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.

         <title>Simultaneous Incorporation of Two Types of Azo&#8208;Groups in the Side Chains of a Conjugated D&#8211;A Polymer for Logic Control of the Semiconducting Performance by Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated D&#8211;A polymers with two types of azo groups, for which trans&#8211;cis isomerization can sequentially occur with light irradiation at different wavelengths, in the side chains possess tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states. As a consequence, the performance of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths, mimicking three&#8208;value logic gates.








Abstract
A new design strategy for photoresponsive semiconducting polymer with tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states is reported by simultaneous incorporation of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted azobenzene (mAzo) and arylazopyrazole (pAzo) in the side chains. The trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transformations for mAzo and pAzo groups can sequentially occur within the polymer thin film after sequential 560 and 365&#160;nm light irradiation. Remarkably, the trans&#8211;cis isomerization of mAzo and pAzo groups can modulate the thin film crystallinity. Accordingly, the performances of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) can be reversibly modulated, leading to tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states after sequential 560, 365, and 470&#160;nm light irradiation. Therefore, the device performance can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths. In addition, with light irradiation and device current as the input and output signals, the three&#8208;value logic gate by using single FET device can be successfully mimicked.

Changing the molecular environment in direct vicinity to the active amine group opens up vast possibilities to fine&#8208;tune CO2 adsorption. Through the introduction of various neighboring groups (NGs), key metrics such as the heat of adsorption and selectivity can be tuned. The investigation of such NG interaction is enabled by a new, highly flexible model system based on click chemistry.








Abstract
Improved carbon capture materials are crucial for managing the CO2 level in the atmosphere. The past focus was on increasing adsorption capacities. It is widely known that controlling the heat of adsorption (&#916;Hads) is equally important. If it is too low, CO2 uptake takes place at unfavorable conditions and with insufficient selectivity. If it is too high, chemisorption occurs, and the materials can hardly be regenerated. The conventional approach for influencing &#916;Hads is the modification of the adsorbing center. This paper proposes an alternative strategy. The hypothesis is that fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular environment around the adsorbing center is a powerful tool for the adjustment of CO2&#8208;binding properties. Via click chemistry, any desired neighboring group (NG) can be incorporated on the surfaces of the nanoporous organosilica model materials. Passive NGs induce a change in the polarity of the surface, whereas active NGs are capable of direct interaction with the active center/CO2 pair. The effects on &#916;Hads and on the selectivity are studied. A situation can be realized which resembles frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, and the investigation of the binding&#8208;species by solid&#8208;state NMR indicates that the push&#8211;pull effects could play an essential role not only in CO2 adsorption but also in its activation.

         <title>Paper&#8208;Embedded Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Mass Printed Piezoelectric Transducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paper&#8208;based fully roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufactured flexible lightweight large&#8208;area piezoelectric transducers are presented. Embedding the printed electronic layers into conventional paper webs by inline lamination and inline poling leads to piezoelectric devices with high remnant polarization and high production yield. The development gives the opportunity i.a. for novel surround sound installations of several meter length.








Abstract
The trend to a world with ubiquitous electronics has the need for novel concepts for sensors and actuators that are lightweight, flexible, low&#8208;cost, and also sustainable. Piezoelectric transducers on the basis of functional polymers can meet these expectations. In this work, a novel concept for paper&#8208;embedded large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices realized solely by means of roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) mass printing and post printing technologies including inline poling are introduced. The device set&#8208;up, as well as the process technology, offers the great opportunity for a cost&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly mass production of thin and flexible organic large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices. As the functional layers are embedded into paper by the hot lamination of two poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) layers, the printed electronics is protected and invisible. The paper gives insights to the R2R printing of a 500 m long web including R2R post printing processes and electrical and acoustic inline characterization. Fully R2R processed devices show a high remnant polarization of up to 78&#160;mC&#160;m&#8722;2 and can be realized with high yield of &gt;90%.&#160;Finally, a 360&#176; surround&#8208;sound installation realized with a 387&#160;cm long paper web consisting of 56 piezoelectric speakers including wiring is presented.

         <title>Formation of Novel Octuplex DNA Molecules from Guanine Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel type of DNA&#8208;based molecule, with the highest number of guanines per cross section, is reported. Atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and CD spectroscopy of guanine octuplex (G8&#8208;) DNA reveal its organized, mechanically and thermodynamically stable, of high guanine content, coiled&#8208;coil structure&#8212;which make it a prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.








Abstract
Guanine quadruplex (G4)&#8208;DNA structures have sparked the interest of many scientists due to their important biological roles and their potential use in molecular nanoelectronics and nanotechnology. The high guanine content in G4&#8208;DNA endows it with mechanical stability, robustness, and improved charge transport properties&#8212;attractive attributes for a molecular nanowire. The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel G4&#8208;DNA&#8208;based nanostructure, coined guanine octuplex (G8)&#8208;DNA, is reported herein. Atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of this molecule reveal its organized coiled&#8208;coil structure, which is found to be stable under different temperatures and surrounding conditions. G8&#8208;DNA exhibits enhanced stiffness, mechanical and thermodynamic stability when compared to its parent G4&#8208;DNA. These, along with its high guanine content, make G8&#8208;DNA a compelling new molecule, and a highly prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of High&#8208;Capacity Micro&#8208;Sized Antimony Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyte&#8208;engineering approach is presented to stabilize the micro&#8208;sized alloying anodes (e.g., Sb anode) in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. A high capacity of 628 mAh g&#8211;1 close to the capacity limit of potassium metal is achieved. An interfacial model related to the electronegativity and stability of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anions is presented to predict and analyze the electrolyte stability and electrode performance.








Abstract
Alloying anodes exhibit very high capacity when used in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but their severe capacity fading hinders their practical applications. The failure mechanism has traditionally been attributed to the large volumetric change and/or their fragile solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that an antimony (Sb) alloying anode, even in bulk form, can be stabilized readily by electrolyte engineering. The Sb anode delivers an extremely high capacity of 628 and 305 mAh g&#8211;1 at current densities of 100 and 3000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, respectively, and remains stable for more than 200 cycles. Interestingly, there is no need to do nanostructural engineering and/or carbon modification to achieve this excellent performance. It is shown that the change in K+ solvation structure, which is tuned by electrolyte composition (i.e., anion, solvent, and concentration), is the main reason for achieving this excellent performance. Moreover, an interfacial model based on the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex behavior is presented. The electronegativity of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex, which can be tuned by changing the solvent type and anion species, is used to predict and control electrode stability. The results shed new light on the failure mechanism of alloying anodes, and provide a new guideline for electrolyte design that stabilizes metal&#8208;ion batteries using alloying anodes.

         <title>A Patternable and In Situ Formed Polymeric Zinc Blanket for a Reversible Zinc Anode in a Skin&#8208;Mountable Microbattery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc blanket created by the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms in a polyimide coating and zinc ions overcomes the thermodynamic instability and facilitates plating/stripping kinetics. Patterning this zinc blanket for a Zn microanode allows for the development of a skin&#8208;mountable microbattery with an outstanding rate capability and stable cycling performance, providing promise for microbatteries integrable for electronic skin.








Abstract
Owing to their high safety and reversibility, aqueous microbatteries using zinc anodes and an acid electrolyte have emerged as promising candidates for wearable electronics. However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten&#8208;hour rest. Widespread anti&#8208;corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor&#8208;level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin&#8208;mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti&#8208;corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.

Patterning this zinc blanket for a Zn microanode allows for the development of a skin&#8208;mountable microbattery with an outstanding rate capability and stable cycling performance, providing promise for microbatteries integrable for electronic skin.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their high safety and reversibility, aqueous microbatteries using zinc anodes and an acid electrolyte have emerged as promising candidates for wearable electronics. However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten&#8208;hour rest. Widespread anti&#8208;corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor&#8208;level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin&#8208;mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti&#8208;corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Spin Textures in Amorphous Iron&#8211;Germanium Thick Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological magnetic states emerge in amorphous iron&#8211;germanium with local inversion symmetry breaking. The formation of helical spins, Bloch skyrmions, and anisotropic skyrmions is accompanied by a suppressed orbital moment, indicating electron orbital disorder. Temporal evolution of thermal spin fluctuations reveals a persistent switching of anisotropic skyrmions between two discrete states affirming degenerate spin chirality and particle&#8208;like properties.








Abstract
Topological solitary fields, such as magnetic and polar skyrmions, are envisioned to revolutionize microelectronics. These configurations have been stabilized in solid&#8208;state materials with a global inversion symmetry breaking, which translates in magnetic materials into a vector spin exchange known as the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI), as well as spin chirality selection and isotropic solitons. This work reports experimental evidence of 3D chiral spin textures, such as helical spins and skyrmions with different chirality and topological charge, stabilized in amorphous Fe&#8211;Ge thick films. These results demonstrate that structurally and chemically disordered materials with a random DMI can resemble inversion symmetry broken systems with similar magnetic properties, moments, and states. Disordered systems are distinguished from systems with global inversion symmetry breaking by their degenerate spin chirality that allows for forming isotropic and anisotropic topological spin textures at remanence, while offering greater flexibility in materials synthesis, voltage, and strain&#160;manipulation.

         <title>In Situ Lignin Modification toward Photonic Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic wood with high lignin content is fabricated via an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The resulting photonic wood features a unique hierarchical microstructure, high mechanical strength, excellent water stability, remarkable optical properties and designable patterning capability.








Abstract
Lignin serves as a binder that forms strong matrices of the cell walls of wood. However, it has many photolabile chromophore groups that create a monotonic brownish color and make wood susceptible to photodegradation. Herein, a new strategy is reported for modifying lignin using an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The reaction selectively eliminates lignin's chromophores while leaving the aromatic skeleton intact, thus modulating the optical properties of wood. The resulting &#8220;photonic wood&#8221; retains &#8776;80% of its original lignin content, which continues to serve as a strong binder and water&#8208;proofing agent. As a result, photonic wood features a much higher mechanical strength in a wet environment (20&#8208;times higher tensile strength and 12&#8208;times greater compression resistance), significant scalability (&#8776;2 m long sample), and largely reduced processing times (1&#8211;6.5 h vs 4&#8211;14 h) compared with delignification methods. Additionally, this in situ lignin&#8208;modified wood structure is easily patterned through a photocatalytic oxidation process. This photocatalytic production of photonic wood paves the way for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of sustainable biosourced functional materials for a range of applications, including energy&#8208;efficient buildings, optical management, and fluidic, ionic, electronic, and optical devices.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8208;Based Magnetic Composite Films for Reconfigurable Shape&#8208;Morphing Soft Miniature Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer material with embedded ferromagnetic microparticles takes advantage of both magnetic and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Such a monolithic soft material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that self&#8208;adapt to changing environmental conditions. The hybrid material introduces a multi&#8208;modal actuation and physical intelligence capability for wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive and active materials promise radical advances for many applications. In particular, soft magnetic materials offer precise, fast, and wireless actuation together with versatile functionality, while liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are capable of large reversible and programmable shape&#8208;morphing with high work densities in response to various environmental stimuli, e.g., temperature, light, and chemical solutions. Integrating the orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of these two kinds of active materials could potentially enable new functionalities and future applications. Here, magnetic microparticles (MMPs) are embedded into an LCE film to take the respective advantages of both materials without compromising their independent stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. This composite material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that can self&#8208;adapt to a changing environment. In particular, a miniature soft robot that can autonomously alter its locomotion mode when it moves from air to hot liquid, a vine&#8208;like filament that can sense and twine around a support, and a light&#8208;switchable magnetic spring are demonstrated. The integration of LCEs and MMPs into monolithic structures introduces a new dimension in the design of soft machines and thus greatly enhances their use in applications in complex environments, especially for miniature soft robots, which are self&#8208;adaptable to environmental changes while being remotely controllable.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Stable and Li&#8208;Metal&#8208;Compatible Glass&#8208;Ceramic Electrolyte enabling High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed to simultaneously possess high ionic conductivity (10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 level at room temperature), excellent air&#8208;stability (dry room operable), and good Li metal compatibility. It is expected that this finding can help to accelerate the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) has attracted significant attention due to their potential to maximize energy density and improved safety compared to the conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is very challenging to fabricate an ideal solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) that simultaneously possesses high ionic conductivity, excellent air&#8208;stability, and good Li metal compatibility. Herein, a new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 (gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4) SSE is synthesized to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs at room temperature (RT). Compared with the conventional Li3PS4 glass&#8208;ceramics, the present gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE with 12% amorphous content has an enlarged unit cell and a high Li+ ion concentration, which leads to 6.2&#8208;times higher ionic conductivity (1.21 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at RT) after a simple cold sintering process. The (P/Sn)S4 tetrahedron inside the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE is verified to show a strong resistance toward reaction with H2O in 5%&#8208;humidity air, demonstrating excellent air&#8208;stability. Moreover, the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE triggers the formation of Li&#8211;Sn alloys at the Li/SSE interface, serving as an essential component to stabilize the interface and deliver good electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells. The discovery of this gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 superionic conductor enriches the choice of advanced SSEs and accelerates the commercialization of ASSLMBs.

The (P/Sn)S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedron inside the gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SSE is verified to show a strong resistance toward reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in 5%&#8208;humidity air, demonstrating excellent air&#8208;stability. Moreover, the gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SSE triggers the formation of Li&#8211;Sn alloys at the Li/SSE interface, serving as an essential component to stabilize the interface and deliver good electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells. The discovery of this gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; superionic conductor enriches the choice of advanced SSEs and accelerates the commercialization of ASSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multiscale Assembly of [AgS4] Tetrahedrons into Hierarchical Ag&#8211;S Networks for Robust Photonic Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infinite 2D Ag&#8211;S network&#8208;based hierarchical structures are constructed through the multiscale assembly of the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit, spanning from atomic&#8208;, molecular&#8208;, nanometer&#8208;, to micrometer&#8208;scale. The resulting ensembles show the function of a 1D photonic reflector in water, and have a robust and customizable structural color.








Abstract
There is an urgent need to assemble ultrasmall metal chalcogenides (with atomic precision) into functional materials with the required anisotropy and uniformity, on a micro&#8208; or even macroscale. Here, a delicate yet simple chemistry is developed to produce a silver&#8211;sulfur network microplate with a high monodispersity in size and morphology. Spanning from the atomic, molecular, to nanometer, to micrometer scale, the key structural evolution of the obtained microplates includes 2D confinement growth, edge&#8208;sharing growth mode, and thermodynamically driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, all of which are derived from the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit. The key to such a high hierarchical, complex, and accurate assembly is the dense deprotonated ligand layer on the surface of the microplates, forming an infinite surface with high negative charge density. This feature operates at an orderly distance to allow further hierarchical self&#8208;assembly on the microscale to generate columnar assemblies composed of microplate components, thereby endowing the feature of the 1D photonic reflector to water (i.e., photonic water). The reflective color of the resulting photonic water is highly dependent on the thickness of the building blocks (i.e., silver&#8211;sulfur microplates), and the coexistent order and fluidity help to form robust photonic water.

         <title>Direct Synthesis and Enhanced Rectification of Alloy&#8208;to&#8208;Alloy 2D Type&#8208;II MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y Heterostructures</title>

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step growth of alloy/alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) vertical heterostructures is demonstrated and the heterostructure exhibits a nearly intrinsic van der Waals (vdW) interface in terms of a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface as well as a well&#8208;aligned epitaxial relationship. The almost&#8208;ideal interface enables the identification of the intrinsic behavior of the heterostructures such as the band alignment, charge transfer, and carrier transport.








Abstract
The interfacial tunable band alignment of heterostructures is coveted in device design and optimization of device performance. As an intentional approach, alloying allows band engineering and continuous band&#8208;edge tunability for low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. Thus, combining the tunability of alloying with the band structure of a heterostructure is highly desirable for the improvement of device characteristics. In this work, the single&#8208;step growth of alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) 2D vertical heterostructures is demonstrated. Electron diffraction reveals the well&#8208;aligned heteroepitaxial relationship for the heterostructure, and a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface is observed. The nearly intrinsic van der Waals (vdW) interface enables measurement of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures. The optimized type&#8208;II band alignment for the MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y heterostructure, along with the large band offset and effective charge transfer, is confirmed through quenched PL spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Devices based on completely stacked heterostructures show one or two orders enhanced electron&#160;mobility and rectification ratio than those of the constituent materials. The realization of device&#8208;quality alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy heterostructures provides a new material platform for precisely tuning band alignment and optimizing device applications.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Evolution of Oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 Defective Sites for Alkaline Freshwater and Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance of seawater. A&#160;novel Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst with oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 and Ni&#8208;N4 coordination is developed to achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline seawater electrolytes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;N3 facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption during HER.








Abstract
For mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel by electrochemical water splitting, seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to the traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance and low cost of seawater in nature. However, the undesirable chlorine ion oxidation reactions occurring simultaneously with seawater electrolysis greatly hinder the overall performance of seawater electrolysis. To tackle this problem, electrocatalysts of high activity and selectivity with purposely modulated coordination and an alkaline environment are urgently required. Herein, it is demonstrated that atomically dispersed Ni with triple nitrogen coordination (Ni&#8208;N3) can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media. The atomically dispersed Ni electrocatalysts exhibit overpotentials as low as 102 and 139&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes, respectively, which compare favorably with those previously reported. They also deliver large current densities beyond 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 at lower overpotentials than Pt/C, as well as show negligible current attenuation over 14 h. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Ni&#8208;N3 coordination, which exhibits a lower coordination number than Ni&#8208;N4, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity.

         <title>Micellar Lyotropic Nematic Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators to lyotropic nematic phases a new kind of liquid crystal network, namely lyotropic nematic physical gels, is obtained. These lyotropic nematic gels combine anisotropy with mechanical stability and are promising new materials for the field of soft robotics and biomimetic actuation.








Abstract
Lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) gels are a new class of liquid crystal (LC) networks that combine the anisotropy of micellar LLCs with the mechanical stability of a gel. However, so far, only micellar LLC gels with lamellar and hexagonal structures have been obtained by the addition of gelators to LLCs. Here, the first examples of lyotropic nematic gels are presented. The key to obtain these nematic gels is the use of gelators that have a non&#8208;amphiphilic molecular structure and thus leave the size and shape of the micellar aggregates essentially unchanged. By adding these gelators to lyotropic nematic phases, an easy and reproducible way to obtain large amounts of lyotropic nematic gels is established. These nematic gels preserve the long&#8208;range orientational order and optical birefringence of a lyotropic nematic phase but have the mechanical stability of a gel. LLC nematic gels are promising new materials for elastic and anisotropic hydrogels to be applied as water&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive actuators and sensors.

         <title>Lattice Matching Growth of Conductive Hierarchical Porous MOF/LDH Heteronanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous metal&#8211;organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) hierarchical heteronanotube arrays consisting of a lattice&#8208;matched 2D conductive MOF and a trimetallic LDH, established by an inner template sacrificial process, enable excellent activity and superior stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction in comparison to the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for the OER.








Abstract
The conjugation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into different multicomponent materials to precisely construct aligned heterostructures is fascinating but elusive owing to the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics. Herein, a promising lattice&#8208;matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoNiFe&#8208;LDH nanowires are used as interior template to engineer an interface by inlaying cMOF and matching two crystal lattice systems, thus conducting a graft growth of cMOF/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanowire. A class of hierarchical porous cMOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays is produced through continuously regulating the transformation degree. The synergistic effects of the cMOF and LDH components significantly promote the chemical and electronic structures of the heteronanotube arrays and their electroactive surface area. Optimized heteronanotube arrays exhibit extraordinary OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 216 and 227&#160;mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec&#8722;1, ranking it among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER. The robust performance under high current density and vigorous gas bubble conditions enable such hierarchical MOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays as promising materials for practical water electrolysis.

         <title>Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy at High&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inelastic tunneling spectroscopy is shown to be a viable high&#8208;resolution technique to analyze mobile species in solids at high&#8208;temperatures. In the measurements reported, BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures are used as proton conductors and tunnel barriers. By analyzing O&#63743;H bond vibrations at 400 K, the existence of protons in the tunnel barriers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Ion conducting materials are critical components of batteries, fuel cells, and devices such as memristive switches. Analytical tools are therefore sought that allow the behavior of ions in solids to be monitored and analyzed with high spatial resolution and in real time. In principle, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy offers these capabilities. However, as its spectral resolution is limited by thermal softening of the Fermi&#8211;Dirac distribution, tunneling spectroscopy is usually constrained to cryogenic temperatures. This constraint would seem to render tunneling spectroscopy useless for studying ions in motion. Here, the first inelastic tunneling spectroscopy studies above room temperature are reported. For these measurements, high&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable tunnel junctions that incorporate within the tunnel barrier ultrathin layers for efficient proton conduction are developed. By analyzing the vibrational modes of O&#63743;H bonds in BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures, the detection of protons with a spectral resolution of 20 meV at 400 K (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half maximum) is demonstrated. Overturning the hitherto existing prediction for the spectral resolution limit of 186 meV (5.4 kBT ) at 400 K, this resolution enables high&#8208;temperature tunneling spectroscopy of ion conductors. With these advances, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy constitutes a novel, valuable analytical tool for solid&#8208;state ionics.

         <title>Tuning the Selective Adsorption Site of Biomass on Co3O4 by Ir Single Atoms for Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of Ir are anchored on Co3O4 for efficient electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). It is found that an isolated Ir atom can optimize the adsorption configuration of HMF molecules on catalysts and accelerate HMF oxidation.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a green strategy to achieve biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value chemicals. As the molecular structure of HMF is relatively complicated, understanding the HMF adsorption/catalysis behavior on electrocatalysts is vital for biomass&#8208;based electrosynthesis. The electrocatalysis behavior can be modulated by tuning the adsorption energy of the reactive molecules. In this work, the HMF adsorption behavior on spinel oxide, Co3O4 is discovered. Correspondingly, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co3O4 is successfully tuned by decorating with single&#8208;atom Ir. It is observed that compared with bare Co3O4, single&#8208;atom&#8208;Ir&#8208;loaded Co3O4 (Ir&#8208;Co3O4) can enhance adsorption with the C&#63742;C groups of HMF. The synergetic adsorption can enhance the overall conversion of HMF on electrocatalysts. With the modulated HMF adsorption, the as&#8208;designed Ir&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a record performance (with an onset potential of 1.15 VRHE) for the electrosynthesis from HMF.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Cation and Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smaller cations and anions are incorporated into FAPbI3 single crystal to release its lattice stress and enhance its stability. The formed inch&#8208;sized triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals exhibit suppressed ion migration, long carrier diffusion length, large mobility, and excellent uniformity. These superior properties are utilized for the construction of a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detector array, realizing high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Low ionic migration is required for a semiconductor material to realize stable high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection. In this work, successful controlled incorporation of not only methylammonium (MA+) and cesium (Cs+) cations, but also bromine (Br&#8211;) anions into the FAPbI3 lattice to grow inch&#8208;sized stable perovskite single crystal (FAMACs SC) is reported. The smaller cations and anions, comparing to the original FA+ and I&#8211; help release lattice stress so that the FAMACs SC shows lower ion migration, enhanced hardness, lower trap density, longer carrier lifetime and diffusion length, higher charge mobility and thermal stability, and better uniformity. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors made of the superior FAMACs SCs show the highest sensitivity of (3.5 &#177; 0.2) &#215; 106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, about 29 times higher than the latest record of 1.22 &#215; 105 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for polycrystalline MAPbI3 wafer under the same 40 keV X&#8208;ray radiation. Furthermore, the FAMACs SC X&#8208;ray detector shows a low detection limit of 42 nGy s&#8722;1, stable dark current, and photocurrent response. Finally, it is demonstrated that high contrast X&#8208;ray imaging is realized using the FAMACs SC detector. The effective triple&#8208;cation mixed halide strategy and the high crystalline quality make the present FAMACs SCs promising for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

&lt;p&gt;Smaller cations and anions are incorporated into FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal to release its lattice stress and enhance its stability. The formed inch&#8208;sized triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals exhibit suppressed ion migration, long carrier diffusion length, large mobility, and excellent uniformity. These superior properties are utilized for the construction of a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detector array, realizing high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low ionic migration is required for a semiconductor material to realize stable high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection. In this work, successful controlled incorporation of not only methylammonium (MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cesium (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cations, but also bromine (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions into the FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lattice to grow inch&#8208;sized stable perovskite single crystal (FAMACs SC) is reported. The smaller cations and anions, comparing to the original FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; help release lattice stress so that the FAMACs SC shows lower ion migration, enhanced hardness, lower trap density, longer carrier lifetime and diffusion length, higher charge mobility and thermal stability, and better uniformity. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors made of the superior FAMACs SCs show the highest sensitivity of (3.5 &#177; 0.2) &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, about 29 times higher than the latest record of 1.22 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for polycrystalline MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; wafer under the same 40 keV X&#8208;ray radiation. Furthermore, the FAMACs SC X&#8208;ray detector shows a low detection limit of 42 nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, stable dark current, and photocurrent response. Finally, it is demonstrated that high contrast X&#8208;ray imaging is realized using the FAMACs SC detector. The effective triple&#8208;cation mixed halide strategy and the high crystalline quality make the present FAMACs SCs promising for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrasmall, Bright, and Photostable Fluorescent Core&#8211;Shell Aluminosilicate Nanoparticles for Live&#8208;Cell Optical Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold coordinated aluminum within ultrasmall aluminosilicate nanoparticles leads to redox&#8208;type blinking of encapsulated organic fluorophores under live&#8208;cell imaging conditions. Their blinking, brightness, and photostability characteristics make these excellent probes for optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy. These nontoxic nanoparticles can be used to interrogate both fixed and live&#8208;cell systems as well as to quantitatively study the processing of nanoparticles within live cells.








Abstract
Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is an optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) technique that traditionally requires toxic and non&#8208;physiological imaging buffers and setups that are not conducive to live&#8208;cell studies. It is observed that ultrasmall (&lt;10&#160;nm) fluorescent core&#8211;shell aluminosilicate nanoparticles (aC&#8217; dots) covalently encapsulating organic fluorophores enable STORM with a single excitation source and in a regular (non&#8208;toxic) imaging buffer. It is shown that fourfold coordinated aluminum is responsible for dye blinking, likely via photoinduced redox processes. It is demonstrated that this phenomenon is observed across different dye families leading to probes brighter and more photostable than the parent free dyes. Functionalization of aC&#8217; dots with antibodies allows targeted fixed cell STORM imaging. Finally, aC&#8217; dots enable live&#8208;cell STORM imaging providing quantitative measures of the size of intracellular vesicles and the number of particles per vesicle. The results suggest the emergence of a powerful ultrasmall, bright, and photostable optical SRM particle platform with characteristics relevant to clinical translation for the quantitative assessment of cellular structures and processes from live&#8208;cell imaging.

         <title>Efficient Luminescent Halide Quadruple&#8208;Perovskite Nanocrystals via Trap&#8208;Engineering for Highly Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with R3&#773;m space group symmetry are synthesized. The photoluminescence quantum yield can be enhanced by 96&#8208;fold via metal alloying. Photodetectors based on the quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs exhibit high responsivity up to 0.98 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1.








Abstract
The colloidal synthesis of a new type of lead&#8208;free halide quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is reported. The photoluminescence quantum yield and charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can be enhanced by 96 and 77&#8208;fold, respectively, via metal alloying. Study of charge&#8208;carrier dynamics provide solid demonstrate that the PL enhancement is due to the elimination of ultrafast (1.4 ps) charge&#8208;carrier trapping processes in the alloyed NCs. Thanks to the high crystallinity, low trap&#8208;state density, and long carrier lifetime (193.4 &#956;s), the alloyed quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can serve as the active material for high&#8208;performance photodetectors, which exhibit high responsivity (up to 0.98 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3 &#215; 106%. These numbers are among the highest for perovskite&#8208;NC&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Controllable Capillary Assembly of Magnetic Ellipsoidal Janus Particles into Tunable Rings, Chains and Hexagonal Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles assemble into rings, chains, and hexagonal&#8208;lattice structures at fluid&#8211;fluid interfaces driven by capillary interactions, where a dynamical transition between these assembly states can be obtained by dynamically manipulating the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Colloidal assembly at fluid interfaces has a great potential for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of novel structured materials. However, challenges remain in realizing controllable and tunable assembly of particles into diverse structures. Herein, the capillary assembly of magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at a fluid&#8211;fluid interface is reported. Depending on their tilt angle, that is, the angle the particle main axis forms with the fluid interface, these particles deform the interface and generate capillary dipoles or hexapoles. Driven by capillary interactions, multiple particles thus assemble into chain&#8208;, hexagonal&#8208;lattice&#8208;, and ring&#8208;like structures, which can be actively controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A field&#8208;strength phase diagram is predicted in which various structures are present as stable states. Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel&#160;materials.

         <title>Colors of Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The colors of 466 species of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are revealed by experiments on clean dry thin films and modeling of the carbon nanotube absorbance spectra. A quantitative coloration model of SWCNTs is proposed and is verified by existing experimental data. This model predicts the existence of brilliantly colored carbon nanotube films that can display the full rainbow.








Abstract
Although single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit various colors in suspension, directly synthesized SWCNT films usually appear black. Recently, a unique one&#8208;step method for directly fabricating green and brown films has been developed. Such remarkable progress, however, has brought up several new questions. The coloration mechanism, potentially achievable colors, and color controllability of SWCNTs are unknown. Here, a quantitative model is reported that can predict the specific colors of SWCNT films and unambiguously identify the coloration mechanism. Using this model, colors of 466 different SWCNT species are calculated, which reveals a broad spectrum of potentially achievable colors of SWCNTs. The calculated colors are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Furthermore, the theory predicts the existence of many brilliantly colored SWCNT films, which are experimentally expected. This study shows that SWCNTs as a form of pure carbon, can display a full spectrum of vivid colors, which is expected to complement the general understanding of carbon materials.

         <title>Enhanced Redox Kinetics and Duration of Aqueous I2/I&#8722; Conversion Chemistry by MXene Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene confinement strategy is proposed to boost the redox kinetics and cycle duration of an aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery via an electrodeposition method. The confinement effect and superior electron supply of the Nb2CTX MXene host results in an efficient I2/I&#8722; couple conversion and suppression of the undesired shuttle effect, resulting in excellent power density, energy density, and anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance.








Abstract
Weak binding and affinity between the conductive support and iodine species leads to inadequate electron transfer and the shuttle effect. Herein, redox kinetics and duration are significantly boosted by introducing a Nb2CTX host that is classified as a layered 2D Nb&#8208;based MXene. With a facile electrodeposition strategy, initial I&#8722; ions are electrically driven to insert in the nanosized interlayers and are electro&#8208;oxidized in situ. Linear I2 is firmly confined inside and benefits from the rapid charge supply from the MXene. Consequently, an aqueous Zn battery based on a Zn metal anode and ZnSO4 electrolyte delivers an ultraflat plateau at 1.3&#160;V, which contributes to 84.5% of the capacity and 89.1% of the energy density. Record rate capability (143 mAh g&#8722;1 at 18 A g&#8722;1) and lifespan (23&#160;000) cycles are achieved, which are far superior to those of all reported aqueous MXenes and I2&#8211;metal batteries. Moreover, the low voltage decay rate of 5.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1 indicates its superior anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge properties. Physicochemical analyses and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the localized electron transfer and trapping effect of the Nb2CTX MXene host are responsible for enhanced kinetics and suppressed shuttle behavior. This work can be extended to the fabrication of other I2&#8211;metal batteries with long&#8208;life&#8208;time expectations.

Graphene and graphite are black and pure diamonds are colorless to the human eye; however, single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes are colorful. In article number 2006395, Esko I. Kauppinen and co&#8208;workers explain experimentally how these stable colors of carbon nanotubes form, and also demonstrate their brilliance and range. It is surprising that these molecules of pure carbon, like gems, can exhibit a full spectrum of strong and vivid colors.

Multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable promising untethered smart actuators and sensors. In article number 2006191, Metin Sitti and co&#8208;workers develop a hybrid liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer with embedded ferromagnetic microparticles that responds to magnetic, thermal, and optical cues. Such a monolithic material enables reconfigurable environmentally sensitive miniature machines with physical intelligence. The patterned mesogens deform the material into 3D shapes, such as helices, upon actuation. The dual red and blue colors represent the material's magnetic responsiveness.

         <title>Review on Li Deposition in Working Batteries: From Nucleation to Early Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium (Li) nucleation and early growth processes significantly determine the final deposition behavior. The recent progress in influential models proposed to understand the process of Li nucleation and early growth is highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is one of the most promising alternative anode materials of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries demanded for advanced energy storage in the coming fourth industrial revolution. Nevertheless, disordered Li deposition easily causes short lifespan and safety concerns and thus severely hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries. Tremendous efforts are devoted to understanding the mechanism for Li deposition, while the final deposition morphology tightly relies on the Li nucleation and early growth. Here, the recent progress in insightful and influential models proposed to understand the process of Li deposition from nucleation to early growth, including the heterogeneous model, surface diffusion model, crystallography model, space charge model, and Li&#8208;SEI model, are highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding on Li nucleation and early growth, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized. This work broadens the horizon for practical Li metal batteries and also sheds light on more understanding of other important metal&#8208;based batteries involving the metal deposition process.

Abstract
Nano polymorphism (NPM), as an emerging research area in the field of energy storage, and rechargeable batteries, have attracted much attention recently. In this review, the recent progress on the composition and formation of polymorphs, and the evolution processes of different redox electrodes in rechargeable metal&#8208;ion, metal&#8211;air, and metal&#8211;sulfur batteries are highlighted. First, NPM and its significance for rechargeable batteries are discussed. Subsequently, the current NPM modulation strategies of different types of representative electrodes for their corresponding rechargeable battery applications are summarized. The goal is to demonstrate how NPM could tune the intrinsic material properties, and hence, improve their electrochemical activities for each battery type. It is expected that the analysis of polymorphism and electrochemical properties of materials could help identify some &#8220;processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties&#8221; relationships for material design and performance enhancement. Lastly, the current research challenges and potential research directions are discussed to offer guidance and perspectives for future research on NPM engineering.

The ongoing expansion of digitalization approaches influences material research significantly. The complete workflow of the development of novel materials, from synthesis, over characterization, to fabrication will change within the coming years to a more automatic, data&#8208;driven, and robot&#8208;based approach. The current status is summarized and advantages, challenges, and future perspectives discussed.








Abstract
The ongoing digitalization is rapidly changing and will further revolutionize all parts of life. This statement is currently omnipresent in the media as well as in the scientific community; however, the exact consequences of the proceeding digitalization for the field of materials science in general and the way research will be performed in the future are still unclear. There are first promising examples featuring the potential to change discovery and development approaches toward new materials. Nevertheless, a wide range of open questions have to be solved in order to enable the so&#8208;called digital&#8208;supported material research. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the present and future challenges, as well as the resulting perspectives for materials science are described.

         <title>Strategy of Enhancing the Volumetric Energy Density for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 8, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The volumetric energy density (WV) of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is critical for mobile applications. Key factors that dominate WV progress on WV research are analyzed, and technologies for tuning cathode structure are discussed. A &#8220;three&#8208;high one&#8208;low (THOL)&#8221; strategy is proposed for high WV and gravimetric energy density (WG), and catalytic hosts are important to unlock the sulfur electroactivity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries hold the promise of the next generation energy storage system beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Despite the attractive gravimetric energy density (WG), the volumetric energy density (WV) still remains a great challenge for the practical application, based on the primary requirement of Small and Light for Li&#8211;S batteries. This review highlights the importance of cathode density, sulfur content, electroactivity in achieving high energy densities. In the first part, key factors are analyzed in a model on negative/positive ratio, cathode design, and electrolyte/sulfur ratio, orientated toward energy densities of 700&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1/500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Subsequently, recent progresses on enhancing WV for coin/pouch cells are reviewed primarily on cathode. Especially, the &#8220;Three High One Low&#8221; (THOL) (high sulfur fraction, high sulfur loading, high density host, and low electrolyte quantity) is proposed as a feasible strategy for achieving high WV, taking high WG into consideration simultaneously. Meanwhile, host materials with desired catalytic activity should be paid more attention for fabricating high performance cathode. In the last part, key engineering technologies on manipulating the cathode porosity/density are discussed, including calendering and dry electrode coating. Finally, a future outlook is provided for enhancing both WV and WG of the Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Co and Pt Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms with Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt Dimer Sites for Ultrahigh Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging. A route of cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms is reported, which improves the Pt mass activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution significantly.








Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.

This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer application with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested. Nanostructured noble metals with concave features are found to show better catalytic activity and stability hence improve their practical applicability in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitive Compression&#8208;Stress Sensor Using Integrated Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103 Pa, found in a broad range of physical phenomena from the daily life to the laboratory, are not detected by conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials. Visualization and colorimetric quantification of weak compression stresses are achieved by integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, namely layered polydiacetylene and dry liquid, through response cascades.








Abstract
Measurement of mechanical stresses, such as compression, shear, and tensile stresses, contributes toward achieving a safer and healthier life. In particular, the detection of weak compression stresses is required for healthcare monitoring and biomedical applications. Compression stresses in the order of 106&#8211;1010&#160;Pa have been visualized and/or quantified using mechano&#8208;responsive materials in previous works. However, in general, it is not easy to detect compression stresses weaker than 103&#160;Pa using conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials because the dynamic motion of the rigid mechano&#8208;responsive molecules is not induced by such a weak stress. In the present work, weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103&#160;Pa are visualized and measured via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such as layered polydiacetylene (PDA) and dry liquid (DL), through response cascades. DLs consisting of liquid droplets covered by solid particles release the interior liquid and collapse with application of a weak compression stress. The color of the layered PDA is changed by the spilled liquid as a chemical stress. A variety of weak compression stresses, such as expiratory pressure, are visualized and colorimetrically measured using the paper&#8208;based device of the integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Diverse mechano&#8208;sensing devices can be designed via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Infrared Metasurface Augmented by Deep Learning for Monitoring Dynamics between All Major Classes of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces have outstanding light manipulation capabilities at the nanoscale, which enable functions beyond what otherwise is seen in nature. Here, highly sensitive, broadband mid&#8208;IR metasurfaces for spectroscopy are augmented with artificial intelligence to allow the label&#8208;free monitoring of biomolecules from all major classes. This pioneering bioanalytical technology offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling complex biomolecular processes.








Abstract
Insights into the fascinating molecular world of biological processes are crucial for understanding diseases, developing diagnostics, and effective therapeutics. These processes are complex as they involve interactions between four major classes of biomolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which makes it important to be able to discriminate between all these different biomolecular species. In this work, a deep learning&#8208;augmented, chemically&#8208;specific nanoplasmonic technique that enables such a feat in a label&#8208;free manner to not disrupt native processes is presented. The method uses a highly sensitive multiresonant plasmonic metasurface in a microfluidic device, which enhances infrared absorption across a broadband mid&#8208;IR spectrum and in water, despite its strongly overlapping absorption bands. The real&#8208;time format of the optofluidic method enables the collection of a vast amount of spectrotemporal data, which allows the construction of a deep neural network to discriminate accurately between all major classes of biomolecules. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated by monitoring of a multistep bioassay containing sucrose&#8208; and nucleotides&#8208;loaded liposomes interacting with a small, lipid membrane&#8208;perforating peptide. It is envisioned that the presented technology will impact the fields of biology, bioanalytics, and pharmacology from fundamental research and disease diagnostics to drug development.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries: Quantifying Hydrogen Evolution and a Solid&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution in a Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. Meanwhile, a highly electronically insulating but highly Zn2+ ion conductive ZnF2 solid ion conductor is utilized to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction during cycling but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution in Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. The hydrogen fluxes reach 3.76 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell in each segment, and 7.70 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//MnO2 full cell. Then, a highly electronically insulating (0.11 mS cm&#8722;1) but highly Zn2+ ion conductive (80.2 mS cm&#8722;1) ZnF2 solid ion conductor with high Zn2+ transfer number (0.65) is constructed to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition. Precisely quantitated, the Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 cell only produces 0.02 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 of hydrogen (0.53% of the Zn//Zn cell). Encouragingly, a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) full cell only produces maximum hydrogen flux of 0.06 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (0.78% of the Zn//Zn cell) at the fully charging state. Meanwhile, Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 symmetric cell exhibits excellent stability under ultrahigh current density and areal capacity (10 mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2) over 590 h (285 cycles), which far outperforms all reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. In light of the superior Zn@ZnF2 anode, the high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 batteries (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) shows remarkable cycling stability over 1000 cycles with 93.63% capacity retained at &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrogen evolution in Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. The hydrogen fluxes reach 3.76 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell in each segment, and 7.70 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell. Then, a highly electronically insulating (0.11 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) but highly Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion conductive (80.2 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solid ion conductor with high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer number (0.65) is constructed to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition. Precisely quantitated, the Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell only produces 0.02 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen (0.53% of the Zn//Zn cell). Encouragingly, a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) full cell only produces maximum hydrogen flux of 0.06 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.78% of the Zn//Zn cell) at the fully charging state. Meanwhile, Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric cell exhibits excellent stability under ultrahigh current density and areal capacity (10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) over 590 h (285 cycles), which far outperforms all reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. In light of the superior Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode, the high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn@ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) shows remarkable cycling stability over 1000 cycles with 93.63% capacity retained at &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

Solid interfacial contact loss is a severe challenge that impedes the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;inspired smart electrolyte film, with excellent compatibility and self&#8208;adaptability, that can control the interfacial kinetics to form a durable stable interface is reported.

Abstract
Improving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) is a severe challenge because of the notorious solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact loss originating from the repeated expansion and contraction of the Li anodes. Here, it is reported that high&#8208;performance SSBs are enabled by constructing brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar electrolytes that can dynamically adapt to the interface changes during cycling. An electrolyte film with a high mechanical strain (250%) is fabricated by filling viscoelastic (600% strain) and piezoelectric block&#8208;copolymer electrolytes (mortar) into a mixed conductor Li0.33La0.56TiO3&#8208;x nanofiber film (brick). During Li&#8208;plating, the electrolytes can homogenize the interfacial electric field and generate piezoelectricity to promote uniform Li&#8208;deposition, while the mortar can adhere to the Li&#8208;anode without interfacial disintegration in the reversed Li&#8208;stripping. As a result, the electrolytes show excellent compatibility with the electrodes, leading to a long electrochemical cyclability at room temperature. The symmetrical Li//Li cells run stably for 1880 h without forming dendrites, and the LiFePO4/Li full batteries deliver high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.5%) and capacity retention (&gt;85%) over 550 cycles. More practically, the pouch cells exhibit excellent flexibility and safety for potential practical applications.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Spin Torques on Single GdFeCo Magnetic Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is proposed for spintronics. GdFeCo/Cu bilayers are found to be 20 times more efficient than Pt layers to generate spin currents from charge currents. It is also shown that these spin currents create strong &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on GdFeCo without need of heavy metal. This work opens another way to control the magnetic state of devices.








Abstract
Spintronics exploit spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) to generate spin currents, spin torques, and, in the absence of inversion symmetry, Rashba and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The widely used magnetic materials, based on 3d metals such as Fe and Co, possess a small SOC. To circumvent this shortcoming, the common practice has been to utilize the large SOC of nonmagnetic layers of 5d heavy metals (HMs), such as Pt, to generate spin currents and, in turn, exert spin torques on the magnetic layers. Here, a new class of material architectures is introduced, excluding nonmagnetic 5d HMs, for high&#8208;performance spintronics operations. Very strong current&#8208;induced torques exerted on single ferrimagnetic GdFeCo layers, due to the combination of large SOC of the Gd 5d states and inversion symmetry breaking mainly engineered by interfaces, are demonstrated. These &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; are enhanced around the magnetization compensation temperature and can be tuned by adjusting the spin absorption outside the GdFeCo layer. In other measurements, the very large emission of spin current from GdFeCo, 80% (20%) of spin anomalous Hall effect (spin Hall effect) symmetry is determined. This material platform opens new perspectives to exert &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on single magnetic layers as well as to generate spin currents from a magnetic layer.

         <title>Targeted Dual Small Interfering Ribonucleic Acid Delivery via Non&#8208;Viral Polymeric Vectors for Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarriers loaded with siRNA enter lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) by targeting the cellular surface receptor Sca1. Successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs is obtained by silencing the RUNX1 and Gli1 genes in an IPF mouse model administered with Fab&#8242; (siRUNX1&#160;+&#160;siGli1)&#8208;loaded micelles.








Abstract
Inhibiting the myofibroblast differentiation of lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) is a promising yet challenging approach for pulmonary fibrosis (PF) therapy. Here, micelles formed by a graft copolymer of multiple PEGs modified branched polyethylenimine are used for delivering runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 (RUNX1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siRUNX1) to the lung, aiming to inhibit the myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs. LR&#8208;MSC targeting is achieved by functionalizing the micelle surface with an anti&#8208;stem&#8208;cell antigen&#8208;1 antibody fragment (Fab&#8242;). Consequently, therapeutic benefits are obtained by successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs in bleomycin&#8208;induced PF model mice treated with siRUNX1&#8208;loaded micelles. Furthermore, an excellent synergistic effect of PF therapy is achieved for this micelle system loaded siRUNX1 and glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1 (Gli1) small interfering RNA (siGli1), a traditional anti&#8208;PF siRNA of glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1. Hence, this work not only provides RUNX1 as a novel PF therapeutic target, but also as a promising dual siRNA&#8208;loaded nanocarrier system for the therapy of PF.

         <title>Capturing Mobile Lithium Ions in a Molecular Hole Transporter Enhances the Thermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable perovskite solar cell is developed by capturing mobile lithium ions using a new molecular hole transporter, 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38), where a strong interaction of the lithium ions in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide with the 5&#8208;octylthieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (octyl&#8208;TPD) moiety in HL38 is responsible for maintaining &#8776;86% of the initial power conversion efficiency for over 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
A thermally stable perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a new molecular hole transporter (MHT) of 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38) is reported. Hole mobility of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and glass transition temperature of 92.2 &#176;C are determined for the HL38 doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine as additives. Interface engineering with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)thiophene hydroiodide (2&#8208;TEAI) between the perovskite and the HL38 improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.60% (untreated) to 21.98%, and this champion PCE is even higher than that of the additive&#8208;containing 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;MeOTAD)&#8208;based device (21.15%). Thermal stability testing at 85 &#176;C for over 1000 h shows that the HL38&#8208;based PSC retains 85.9% of the initial PCE, while the spiro&#8208;MeOTAD&#8208;based PSC degrades unrecoverably from 21.1% to 5.8%. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry studies combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal that HL38 shows lower lithium ion diffusivity than spiro&#8208;MeOTAD due to a strong complexation of the Li+ with HL38, which is responsible for the higher degree of thermal stability. This work delivers an important message that capturing mobile Li+ in a hole&#8208;transporting layer is critical in designing novel MHTs for improving the thermal stability of PSCs. In addition, it also highlights the impact of interface design on non&#8208;conventional MHTs.

         <title>Unveiling the Local Atomic Arrangements in the Shear Band Regions of Metallic Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct mapping of local atomic bonding and packing in deformed metallic glass is reported, with identification of the structural/chemical variation in and across the shear bands, forming the shear&#8208;affected zones. The results confirm theoretical predictions for local softening in the deformed areas and provide necessary information to further engineer the catastrophic deformation failure of metallic glasses.








Abstract
The prospective applications of metallic glasses are limited by their lack of ductility, attributed to shear banding inducing catastrophic failure. A concise depiction of the local atomic arrangement (local atomic packing and chemical short&#8208;range order), induced by shear banding, is quintessential to understand the deformation mechanism, however still not clear. An explicit view of the complex interplay of local atomic structure and chemical environment is presented by mapping the atomic arrangements in shear bands (SBs) and in their vicinity in a deformed Vitreloy 105 metallic glass, using the scanning electron diffraction pair distribution function and atom probe tomography. The results experimentally prove that plastic deformation causes a reduction of geometrically favored polyhedral motifs. Localized motifs variations and antisymmetric (bond and chemical) segregation extend for several hundred nanometers from the SB, forming the shear band affected zones. Moreover, the variations within the SB are found both perpendicular and parallel to the SB plane, also observable in the oxidation activity. The knowledge of the structural&#8211;chemical changes provides a deeper understanding of the plastic deformation of metallic glasses especially for their functional applications and future improvements.

         <title>Formation of Highly Doped Nanostripes in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides via a Dislocation Climb Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to dope transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) is demonstrated in which a high density (6.4&#8211;15%) of dopants is confined within 1D nanostripes embedded in the TMDC lattice. The growth of the nanostripe structures originates from the migration of dislocation cores and is also the key to introduce dopants into 2D materials.








Abstract
Doping of materials beyond the dopant solubility limit remains a challenge, especially when spatially nonuniform doping is required. In 2D materials with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, various post&#8208;synthesis approaches to doping have been demonstrated, but full control over spatial distribution of dopants remains a challenge. A post&#8208;growth doping of single layers of WSe2 is performed by adding transition metal (TM) atoms in a two&#8208;step process, which includes annealing followed by deposition of dopants together with Se or S. The Ti, V, Cr, and Fe impurities at W sites are identified by using transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Remarkably, an extremely high density (6.4&#8211;15%) of various types of impurity atoms is achieved. The dopants are revealed to be largely confined within nanostripes embedded in the otherwise pristine WSe2. Density functional theory calculations show that the dislocations assist the incorporation of the dopant during their climb and give rise to stripes of TM dopant atoms. This work demonstrates a possible spatially controllable doping strategy to achieve the desired local electronic, magnetic, and optical properties in 2D materials.

         <title>Growing Living Composites with Ordered Microstructures and Exceptional Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm is presented to guide living bacteria to grow bionic mineralized composites. The strategy demonstrates a class of living composites with ordered microstructures and exceptional mechanical properties. This research progress highlights an exciting opportunity for future bionic composite materials by tailoring the interaction or communication between living organisms and 3D&#8208;printed synthetic materials.








Abstract
Living creatures are continuous sources of inspiration for designing synthetic materials. However, living creatures are typically different from synthetic materials because the former consist of living cells to support their growth and regeneration. Although natural systems can grow materials with sophisticated microstructures, how to harness living cells to grow materials with predesigned microstructures in engineering systems remains largely elusive. Here, an attempt to exploit living bacteria and 3D&#8208;printed materials to grow bionic mineralized composites with ordered microstructures is reported. The bionic composites exhibit outstanding specific strength and fracture toughness, which are comparable to natural composites, and exceptional energy absorption capability superior to both natural and artificial counterparts. This report opens the door for 3D&#8208;architectured hybrid synthetic&#8211;living materials with living ordered microstructures and exceptional properties.

         <title>Functional Skeletal Muscle Regeneration with Thermally Drawn Porous Fibers and Reprogrammed Muscle Progenitors for Volumetric Muscle Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioengineered skeletal muscle construct is generated by culturing induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells in a thermally drawn polycaprolactone porous fiber scaffold modified with decellularized muscle extracellular matrix. The hybrid composite fiber shows favorable mechanical and biochemical signals for muscle reprogramming and maturation. The bioengineered muscle construct repairs volumetric muscle loss injury via de novo muscle regeneration and functional restoration.








Abstract
Skeletal muscle has an inherent capacity for spontaneous regeneration. However, recovery after severe injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML) is limited. There is therefore a need to develop interventions to induce functional skeletal muscle restoration. One suggested approach includes tissue&#8208;engineered muscle constructs. Tissue&#8208;engineering treatments have so far been impeded by the lack of reliable cell sources and the challenges in engineering of suitable tissue scaffolds. To address these challenges, muscle extracellular matrix (MEM) and induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) are integrated within thermally drawn fiber based microchannel scaffolds. The microchannel fibers decorated with MEM enhance differentiation and maturation of iMPCs. Furthermore, engraftment of these bioengineered hybrid muscle constructs induce de novo muscle regeneration accompanied with microvessel and neuromuscular junction formation in a VML mouse model, ultimately leading to functional recovery of muscle activity.

         <title>Efficient Reversible Conversion between MoS2 and Mo/Na2S Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Supported Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst of iron single atoms on a nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SAFe@NG) substrate is selected to catalyze reversible conversion in MoS2 anodes. Importantly, the SAFe@NG catalyst with highly active Fe&#8211;N4 sites significantly facilitates the conversion of Mo/Na2S to MoS2 in the charging processes, resulting in an efficient reversible conversion reaction of MoS2&#8596;NaMoS2&#8596;Mo/Na2S in a complete cycle, which is demonstrated by spectroscopy, microscopy, and simulations.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion&#8208;type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S&#8594;NaMoS2&#8594;MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe&#8211;N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2&#8596;NaMoS2&#8596;Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst. This work contributes new avenues for designing conversion&#8208;type materials with an efficient reversible mechanism.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Ternary Organic Photovoltaics with Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing method and a ternary strategy, 18.16% efficiency, which is among the highest values reported to date, is achieved in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;S2 blend, superior to that (18.03%) of bulk&#8208;heterojunction OPVs, proving that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed ternary OPVs could be a promising approach to high efficiencies.








Abstract
Obtaining a finely tuned morphology of the active layer to facilitate both charge generation and charge extraction has long been the goal in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, a solution to resolve the above challenge via synergistically combining the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) procedure and the ternary strategy is proposed and demonstrated. By adding an asymmetric electron acceptor, BTP&#8208;S2, with lower miscibility to the binary donor:acceptor host of PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl, vertical phase distribution can be formed with donor&#8208;enrichment at the anode and acceptor&#8208;enrichment at the cathode in OPV devices during the LbL processing. In contrast, LbL&#8208;type binary OPVs based on PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl still show bulk&#8208;heterojunction like morphology. The formation of the vertical phase distribution can not only reduce charge recombination but also promote charge collection, thus enhancing the photocurrent and fill factor in LbL&#8208;type ternary OPVs. Consequently, LbL&#8208;type ternary OPVs exhibit the best efficiency of 18.16% (certified: 17.8%), which is among the highest values reported to date for OPVs. The work provides a facile and effective approach for achieving high&#8208;efficiency OPVs with expected morphologies, and demonstrates the LbL&#8208;type ternary strategy as being a promising procedure in fabricating OPV devices from the present laboratory study to future industrial production.

         <title>N&#233;el&#8208;Type Elliptical Skyrmions in a Laterally Asymmetric Magnetic Multilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type elliptical magnetic skyrmions are observed in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers with an oblique&#8208;angle deposited Co layer. The formation of elliptical skyrmions is found to be related to the anisotropic effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction in the film plane. The results provide a route to tuning the symmetry of skyrmions for related physics study and device applications.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, topological&#8208;chiral spin textures, have potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices for information storage and logic technologies. Tailoring the detailed spin textures of skyrmions is of pivotal importance for tuning skyrmion dynamics, which is one of the key factors for the design of skyrmionic devices. Here, the direct observation of parallel aligned elliptical magnetic skyrmions in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers with an oblique&#8208;angle deposited Co layer is reported. Domain wall velocity and spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective field analysis demonstrate that the formation of unusual elliptical skyrmions is correlated to the anisotropic effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density (Keffu) and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in the film plane. Structural analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations further show that the anisotropic Keffu and DMI originate from the interfacial anisotropic strain introduced by the oblique&#8208;angle deposition. The work provides a method to tune the spin textures of skyrmions in magnetic multilayers and, thereby, a new degree of freedom for the design of skyrmionic devices.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Superstructure of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanoporous Carbon Implanted with Ultrafine Ru Nanoclusters for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered macroporous superstructure of nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoporous carbon implanted with ultrafine Ru nanoclusters is developed via thermal pyrolysis of the ordered macroporous single crystals of ZIF&#8208;8 accommodating Ru(III) ions, which affords unparalleled performance for the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction, with order of magnitude higher mass activity compared to the benchmark Pt/C.








Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an attractive technology for the mass production of hydrogen. Ru&#8208;based materials are promising electrocatalysts owing to the similar bonding strength with hydrogen but much lower cost than Pt catalysts. Herein, an ordered macroporous superstructure of N&#8208;doped nanoporous carbon anchored with the ultrafine Ru nanoclusters as electrocatalytic micro/nanoreactors is developed via the thermal pyrolysis of ordered macroporous single crystals of ZIF&#8208;8 accommodating Ru(III) ions. Benefiting from the highly interconnected reticular macro&#8211;nanospaces, this superstrucure affords unparalleled performance for pH&#8208;universal HER, with order of magnitude higher mass activity compared to the benchmark Pt/C. Notably, an exceptionally low overpotential of only 13 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is required for HER in alkaline solution, with a low Tafel slope of 40.41&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and an ultrahigh turnover frequency value of 1.6 H2 s&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mV, greatly outperforming Pt/C. Furthermore, the hydrogen generation rates are almost twice those of Pt/C during practical overall alkaline water splitting. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen system is also demonstrated to further promote the application. This research may open a new avenue for the development of advanced electrocatalytic micro/nanoreactors with controlled morphology and excellent performance for future energy applications.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Controlled Gold&#8211;Aluminum&#8211;Silicon Dioxide&#8211;Aluminum Nanopawn Structures for Visible to NIR Light Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersion&#8208;controlled Au nanocolloidal lithography is developed, offering high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over Au nanoparticles. By customizing the SF6 etching&#8208;gas flow and inductively coupled plasma power conditions, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures with good sidewall verticality (&#8776;90&#176;) and high aspect ratio (&gt;1) are demonstrated. As practical applications, triple&#8208;channel color filters and complementary&#8208;color information encryption are demonstrated.








Abstract
As an efficient patterning method for nanostructures, nanocolloidal lithography (NCL) presents a controllable and scalable means for achieving a uniform and good sidewall profile, and a high aspect ratio. While high selectivity between the etching mask and targeted materials is also essential for NCL&#8208;based precision nanophotonic structures, its realization in multi&#8208;material nanophotonic structures still remains a challenge due to the dielectric&#8208; or metallic&#8208;material&#8208;dependent etching selectivity. Here, dispersion&#8208;controlled Au&#8208;NCL is proposed, which enables high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over a Au nanoparticle (Au&#8208;NP) mask. Utilizing the proposed process, wafer&#8208;scale, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures (Au&#8208;NPs/Al&#8211;SiO2 cylinders) on an Al ultrathin film are realized, obtaining excellent vertical sidewall (&#8776;90&#176;) and aspect ratio (&gt;1). The high sidewall verticality and aspect ratio of the nanopawn structures support optical modes highly sensitive to the excitation direction of incident waves through the mixing of the interface&#8208;gap&#8208;assisted localized surface plasmons (GLSPs) formed in between the Au&#8208;NP and Al&#8208;disk interface, and plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) modes formed in between the Al&#8208;disk and Al substrate; complementary spectral responses between reflected and scattered light are also demonstrated. As an application example, information encryption based on the triple&#8208;channel (i.e., reflection, scattering, and transmission) angle&#8208;dependent complementary&#8208;color responses is presented.

&lt;p&gt;Dispersion&#8208;controlled Au nanocolloidal lithography is developed, offering high selectivity for Al and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over Au nanoparticles. By customizing the SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; etching&#8208;gas flow and inductively coupled plasma power conditions, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures with good sidewall verticality (&#8776;90&#176;) and high aspect ratio (&amp;gt;1) are demonstrated. As practical applications, triple&#8208;channel color filters and complementary&#8208;color information encryption are demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an efficient patterning method for nanostructures, nanocolloidal lithography (NCL) presents a controllable and scalable means for achieving a uniform and good sidewall profile, and a high aspect ratio. While high selectivity between the etching mask and targeted materials is also essential for NCL&#8208;based precision nanophotonic structures, its realization in multi&#8208;material nanophotonic structures still remains a challenge due to the dielectric&#8208; or metallic&#8208;material&#8208;dependent etching selectivity. Here, dispersion&#8208;controlled Au&#8208;NCL is proposed, which enables high selectivity for Al and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a Au nanoparticle (Au&#8208;NP) mask. Utilizing the proposed process, wafer&#8208;scale, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures (Au&#8208;NPs/Al&#8211;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cylinders) on an Al ultrathin film are realized, obtaining excellent vertical sidewall (&lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;90&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;) and aspect ratio (&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;1). The high sidewall verticality and aspect ratio of the nanopawn structures support optical modes highly sensitive to the excitation direction of incident waves through the mixing of the interface&#8208;gap&#8208;assisted localized surface plasmons (GLSPs) formed in between the Au&#8208;NP and Al&#8208;disk interface, and plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) modes formed in between the Al&#8208;disk and Al substrate; complementary spectral responses between reflected and scattered light are also demonstrated.

         <title>Macrocyclic&#8208;Amphiphile&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles for Ratiometric Delivery of Therapeutic Combinations to Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic&#8208;amphiphile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle with the capability of precise loading and ratiometric delivery of different drugs is developed for effective combination chemotherapy. The MASN can quickly convert the optimal drug ratio of a therapeutic combination identified in vitro into therapeutic benefits in vivo, providing a potential platform for the rapid development of effective combinations of cancer therapies.








Abstract
Combination chemotherapy refers to the use of multiple drugs to treat cancer. In this therapy, the optimal ratio of the drugs is essential to achieve drug synergism and the desired therapeutic effects. However, most delivery strategies are unable to precisely control the ratio of the drugs during the drug loading and delivery processes, resulting in inefficient synergy and unpredictable efficacy. Herein, a macrocyclic&#8208;amphiphile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle (MASN) that achieves precise loading and ratiometric delivery of therapeutic combinations is presented. By integrating multiple macrocyclic cavities within a single nanoparticle, the MASN can load multiple drug molecules via the host&#8211;guest interaction, and the ratio of the drugs loaded can be predicted with their initial concentrations and characteristic binding affinity. Moreover, MASNs are readily degraded under a hypoxic microenvironment, allowing spontaneous release of the drugs upon reaching tumor tissues. With precise drug loading and controlled release mechanisms, MASNs achieve ratiometric delivery of multiple commercial drugs to tumors, thereby achieving optimal anti&#8208;tumor effects. Since the optimal drug ratio of a therapeutic combination can be quickly determined in vitro, MASNs can translate this optimal ratio to the therapeutic benefits in vivo, providing a potential platform for the rapid development of effective combination cancer therapies involving multiple drugs.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Like Heterostructures of MoS2/Graphene with Enlarged Interlayer Spacing and Enhanced Hydrophilicity as High&#8208;Performance Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sandwich&#8208;like heterostructure of intercalating graphene into a MoS2 gallery significantly enlarges the MoS2 interlayer spacing from 0.62 to 1.16&#160;nm and simultaneously enhances the hydrophilicity. These structural merits enable facilitated Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and a highly reversible phase transition between 2H&#8208; and 1T&#8208;MoS2 upon Zn2+ insertion/extraction, thus rendering a splendid high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Layered materials have great potential as cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their facile 2D Zn2+ transport channels; however, either low capacity or poor cycling stability limits their practical applications. Herein, two classical layered materials are innovatively combined by intercalating graphene into MoS2 gallery, which results in significantly enlarged MoS2 interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.16&#160;nm) and enhanced hydrophilicity. The sandwich&#8208;structured MoS2/graphene nanosheets self&#8208;assemble into a flower&#8208;like architecture that facilitates Zn&#8208;ion diffusion, promotes electrolyte infiltration, and ensures high structural stability. Therefore, this novel MoS2/graphene nanocomposite exhibits exceptional high&#8208;rate capability (285.4&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 with 141.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (88.2% capacity retention after 1800 cycles). The superior Zn2+ migration kinetics and desirable pseudocapacitive behaviors are confirmed by electrochemical measurements and density functional theory computations. The energy storage mechanism regarding the highly reversible phase transition between 2H&#8208; and 1T&#8208;MoS2 upon Zn&#8208;ion insertion/extraction is elucidated through ex situ investigations. As a proof of concept, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion battery employing the MoS2/graphene cathode demonstrates great stability under different bending conditions. This study paves a new direction for the design and on&#8208;going development of 2D materials as high&#8208;performance cathodes for AZIBs.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting MOF Films on Dielectric Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method is developed to grow high&#8208;quality wafer&#8208;sacle Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film on dielectric substrates. The film exhibits p&#8208;type semiconducting property and excellent photoelectric response. Meanwhile, this growth strategy can also be used to prepare other wafer&#8208;sacle conductive MOF films.








Abstract
The preparation of large&#8208;area 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films remains highly desirable but challenging. Here, inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to grow conductive 2D Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) MOF films on dielectric substrates is developed. Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu2+ and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu2(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&#8722;1, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M3(HHTP)2 (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.

Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative Prediction of the Electro&#8208;Mechanical Response in Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that it is possible to fully rationalize the relation between mechanical deformation and electronic properties of organic molecular semiconductors through a suitable and accessible theory, achieving quantitative agreement with experiments across orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude differences. The protocol provides the tools to identify rapidly new compounds sensitive/insensitive to mechanical deformation for advanced applications such as flexible and wearable devices, like e&#8208;skins.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors&#8217; inherent flexibility makes them appealing for advanced applications such as wearable electronics, e&#8208;skins, or pressure sensors, and can even be used to enhance their intrinsic electronic properties. Unfortunately, these applications for organic materials are currently hindered by the lack of a quantitative understanding of the interplay between their electrical and mechanical properties. In this work, this gap is filled by presenting an accurate methodology able to predict quantitatively the effects of external deformation on the charge transport properties of any organic semiconductors. Three prototypical materials are investigated, showing that the experimental variation of charge carrier mobility with strain is fully reproduced, even in a wide range of deformations applied along different crystal axes. The results indicate that the intrinsic electro&#8208;mechanical response of the materials varies by orders of magnitude within the class of organic semiconductors, a difference rationalized observing that the mobility trend is primarily influenced by the transfer integrals&#8217; variation, rather than by a modification of the crystal phonons. In light of its robustness, accuracy, and low computational cost, this protocol represents an ideal tool to quantify the electro&#8208;mechanical response in new organic compounds, thus establishing a reliable route for a full exploitation of strain engineering in advanced&#160;technologies.

         <title>Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated, which is termed an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable gas sensors provide a next&#8208;generation wearable platform for real&#8208;time protection of human health by monitoring environmental and physiological chemicals. However, the creation of skin&#8208;like wearable gas sensors, possessing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and scalability (4S) simultaneously, has been a big challenge. Here, an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker (IGS) is demonstrated, implemented with free&#8208;standing polymer electrolyte (ionic thermoplastic polyurethane, i&#8208;TPU) as a sensing channel and inkjet&#8208;printed stretchable carbon nanotube electrodes, which enables the IGS to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, stability (against mechanical stress, humidity, and temperature), and scalable fabrication, simultaneously. The IGS demonstrates reliable sensing capability against nitrogen dioxide molecules under not only harsh mechanical stress (cyclic bending with the radius of curvature of 1 mm and cyclic straining at 50%), but also environmental conditions (thermal aging from &#8722;45 to 125 &#176;C for 1000 cycles and humidity aging for 24 h at 85% relative humidity). Further, through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, a &#960;&#8208;hole receptor mechanism is proposed, which can effectively elucidate the origin of the high sensitivity (up to parts per billion level) and selectivity of the ionotronic sensing system. Consequently, this work provides a guideline for the design of ionotronic materials for the achievement of high&#8208;performance and skin&#8208;attachable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting Enabled by Tuning the Hydration Entropy in an Electrochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature coefficient is optimized by tuning the hydration entropy during cation intercalation with Prussian blue analogues. A high thermal energy conversion efficiency of 50% Carnot efficiency is obtained in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle in the very low temperature range of 10&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C. This demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.








Abstract
Harvesting of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is promising, but its application is hampered by a lack of efficient and low&#8208;cost systems. The thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a potential alternative system with high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Here, the temperature coefficient (&#945;), which is a key factor in a TREC, is studied by tuning the hydration entropy of the electrochemical reaction. The change of &#945; in copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) with intercalation of different monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and a larger &#945; value of &#8722;1.004&#160;mV K&#8722;1 being found in the Rb+ system are observed. With a view to practical application, a full cell is constructed for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The resultant &#951;e is 4.34% when TREC operates between 10 and 50&#160;&#176;C, which further reaches 6.21% when 50% heat recuperation is considered. This efficiency equals to 50% of the Carnot efficiency, which is thought to be the highest &#951;e reported for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing the TREC, and the demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.

         <title>Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows, while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications. Here, ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are introduced, combining high&#8208;potential (anodic stability: &gt;5&#160;V vs Li/Li+) and low&#8208;potential (cathodic stability: &lt;0&#160;V vs Li/Li+) imidazolium ionic liquids in a hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelet matrix. These layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes lead to extended electrochemical windows, while preserving high ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature). Using the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes, full&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode are demonstrated, exhibiting voltages that are unachievable with either the high&#8208;potential or low&#8208;potential ionic liquid alone. Compared to ionogel electrolytes based on mixed ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes enable higher stability operation of full&#8208;cell lithium&#8208;ion batteries, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling performance.

Inorganic nanoparticles offer a multifunctional platform for biomedical applications in drug delivery, biosensing, bioimaging, disease diagnosis, screening, and therapies. Homochirality prevalently exists in biological systems composed of asymmetric biochemical activities and processes, so biomedical applications essentially favor the usage of inorganic chiral nanomaterials, which have been widely studied in the past two decades. Here, the latest investigations are summarized including the characterization of 3D stereochirality, the bionic fabrication of hierarchical chirality, extension of the compositional space to poly&#8208;elements, studying optical activities with the (sub&#8208;)single&#8208;particle resolution, and the experimental demonstration in biomedical applications. These advanced studies pave the way toward fully understanding the two important chiral effects (i.e., the chiroptical and enantioselective effects), and prospectively promote the flexible design and fabrication of inorganic chiral nanoparticles with engineerable functionalities to solve diverse practical problems closely associated with environment and public health.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing intracellular delivery approaches are differentiated by their impact resolution to macro&#8208; and micro/nanoengineered strategies. Each method is characterized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargo inside the cell of interest. The applications and future perspectives of micro/nanoscale delivery strategies are discussed.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery is considered an indispensable process for various studies, ranging from medical applications (cell&#8208;based therapy) to fundamental (genome&#8208;editing) and industrial (biomanufacture) approaches. Conventional macroscale delivery systems critically suffer from such issues as low cell viability, cytotoxicity, and inconsistent material delivery, which have opened up an interest in the development of more efficient intracellular delivery systems. In line with the advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology, intracellular delivery based on micro&#8208; and nanoengineered platforms has progressed rapidly and held great promises owing to their unique features. These approaches have been advanced to introduce a smorgasbord of diverse cargoes into various cell types with the maximum efficiency and the highest precision. This review differentiates macro&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and nanoengineered approaches for intracellular delivery. The macroengineered delivery platforms are first summarized and then each method is categorized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargoes inside the cells. Second, particular emphasis is placed on the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered advances in the delivery of biomolecules inside the cells. Furthermore, the applications and challenges of the established and emerging delivery approaches are summarized. The topic is concluded by evaluating the future perspective of intracellular delivery toward the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered approaches.

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Bispyridinium with High Capacity and Stability for Aqueous Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulated conjugation strategy is proposed to engineer viologen for flow batteries. In the oxidized state, the conjugation is &#8220;off&#8221; and the two pyridinium rings behave independently, yielding concomitant transfer of two electrons and one voltage plateau. In the reduced state, the conjugation is &#8220;on&#8221; and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving the cycling stability of the battery.








Abstract
A rotating phenyl ring is introduced between the two pyridinium rings, namely, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylene)bispyridinium tetrachloride ((APBPy)Cl4), to form a switchable conjugation. In this design, the conjugation is switched &#8220;off&#8221; in the oxidized state and the two pyridinium rings behave independently during the redox process, yielding a concomitant transfer of two electrons at the same potential and, thus, simplifying the battery management. The conjugation is switched &#8220;on&#8221; in the reduced state and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving its chemical stability. By pairing 0.50 m (APBPy)Cl4 with a 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl oxyl derivative as the positive electrolyte, a flow battery delivers a high standard cell voltage of 1.730&#160;V and a high specific capacity of 20.0 Ah L&#8211;1. The battery also shows an exceptionally high energy efficiency of 80.8% and a superior cycling stability at 80&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This strategy proves itself a great success in engineering viologen as a two&#8208;electron storage mediator with high capacity and stability.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Theranostics with Glutathione Depletion and Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully biodegradable and biocompatible nanotheranostic (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) is constructed by an in situ biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as a template. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supplying and glutathione&#8208;eliminating enhanced chemodynamic therapy, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, means that the prepared PGC&#8208;DOX is effective for tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging therapy method that kills cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). To overcome the current limitations of the insufficient endogenous H2O2 and the high concentration of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells, an intelligent nanocatalytic theranostics (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) that possesses both H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination properties for efficient cancer therapy is presented. This nanoplatform is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as a template to form biodegradable copper&#8208;doped calcium phosphate nanoparticles, followed by the loading of doxorubicin (DOX). As an enzyme catalyst, GOx can effectively catalyze intracellular glucose to generate H2O2, which not only starves the tumor cells, but also supplies H2O2 for subsequent Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Meanwhile, the redox reaction between the released Cu2+ ions and intracellular GSH will induce GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ to Fenton agent Cu+ ions, and then trigger the H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH by a Cu+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction, resulting in enhanced CDT efficacy. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination enhanced CDT, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, endow the PGC&#8208;DOX with effective tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Metallopolymers Based on Two Orthogonal Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of shape&#8208;memory metallopolymers based on orthogonal supramolecular interactions are presented; i.e., two different metal complexes. By a cyclo mechanic test, the structure&#8211;property relationship is studied, and a strong correlation between the switching temperature, which ranges in this case from 85 to 115&#160;&#176;C, and the structural parameters is achieved.








Abstract
A new shape&#8208;memory polymer is presented, in which both the stable phase as well as the switching unit consist of two different metal complexes. Suitable metal ions, which simultaneously form labile complexes with histidine and stable ones with terpyridine ligands, are identified via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Different copolymers are synthesized, which contain butyl methacrylate as the main monomer and the metal&#8208;binding ligands in the side chains. Zn(TFMS)2 and NiCl2 are utilized for the dual crosslinking, resulting in the formation of metallopolymer networks. The switching temperature can simply be tuned by changing the composition as well as by the choice of the metal ion. Strain fixity rates (about 99%) and very high strain recovery rates (up to 95%) are achieved and the mechanism is revealed using different techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Novel Semimetals: A Case Study of YbMnSb2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal demonstrate the synergetic contribution of Dirac bands and regular band to the thermoelectric performance. A high power factor over 2.1 mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 is achieved due to both high mobility and large thermopower.








Abstract
The emerging class of topological materials provides a platform to engineer exotic electronic structures for a variety of applications. As complex band structures and Fermi surfaces can directly benefit thermoelectric performance it is important to identify the role of featured topological bands in thermoelectrics particularly when there are coexisting classic regular bands. In this work, the contribution of Dirac bands to thermoelectric performance and their ability to concurrently achieve large thermopower and low resistivity in novel semimetals is investigated. By examining the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal as an example, the Dirac bands appear to provide a low resistivity along the direction in which they are highly dispersive. Moreover, because of the regular&#8208;band&#8208;provided density of states, a large Seebeck coefficient over 160 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 300 K is achieved in both directions, which is very high for a semimetal with high carrier concentration. The combined highly dispersive Dirac and regular bands lead to ten times increase in power factor, reaching a value of 2.1&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 300 K. The present work highlights the potential of such novel semimetals for unusual electronic transport properties and guides strategies towards high thermoelectric performance.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printable Fluoropolymer Gas Diffusion Layers for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale structural control in 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymers enables highly tunable gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. By modulating the diffusion of reactants to and products from the catalyst layer during electroreduction, the product distribution is shifted in favor of higher carbon products. Insights into the rational design of electrodes offer a platform for developing and optimizing next&#8208;generation flow reactors.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added multicarbon products from CO2 is a promising strategy to shift chemical production away from fossil fuels. Particularly important is the rational design of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) assemblies to react selectively, at scale, and at high rates. However, the understanding of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in these assemblies is limited for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): particularly important, but incompletely understood, is how the GDL modulates product distributions of catalysts operating in high current density regimes &gt; 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Here, 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymer GDLs with tunable microporosity and structure are reported and probe the effects of permeance, microstructural porosity, macrostructure, and surface morphology. Under a given choice of applied electrochemical potential and electrolyte, a 100&#215; increase in the C2H4:CO ratio due to GDL surface morphology design over a homogeneously porous equivalent and a 1.8&#215; increase in the C2H4 partial current density due to a pyramidal macrostructure are observed. These findings offer routes to improve CO2RR GDEs as a platform for 3D catalyst design.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Induced by the Giant Internal Electric Field of a g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/perylene diimide polymer (PDIP) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is successfully constructed to realize high&#8208;flux charge transfer and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation. A notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
A graphitic carbon nitride/rGO/perylene diimide polymer (g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is successfully constructed to realize high&#8208;flux charge transfer and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting. A giant internal electric field in the Z&#8208;scheme junction is built, enabling the charge separation efficiency to be enhanced dramatically by 8.5 times. Thus, g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP presents an efficient and stable photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 15.80 and 7.80 &#181;mol h&#8722;1, respectively, &#8776;12.1 times higher than g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, a notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. Briefly, this work throws light on enhancing the internal electric field by interface control to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Single&#8208;Phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 Monolayer with Assistance of Enhanced Interface Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The WSe2 monolayer in the 1T&#8217; phase is a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable. Thanks to the enhanced interface interaction, a single&#8208;phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 monolayer is grown on SrTiO3(100) substrate using the molecular beam epitaxy method, and the interlayer in&#8208;plane strain also drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase.








Abstract
The WSe2 monolayer in 1T&#8217; phase is reported to be a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable and so far the fabricated samples have always been in the mixed phase of 1T&#8217; and 2H, which has become a bottleneck for further exploration and potential applications of the nontrivial topological properties. Based on first&#8208;principle calculations in this work, it is found that the 1T&#8217; phase could be more stable than 2H phase with enhanced interface interactions. Inspired by this discovery, SrTiO3 (100) is chosen as substrate and WSe2 monolayer is successfully grown in a 100% single 1T&#8217; phase using the molecular beam epitaxial method. Combining in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, it is found that the in&#8208;plane compressive strain in the interface drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase. Besides providing a new material platform for topological states, the results show that the interface interaction is a new approach to control both the structure phase stability and the topological band structures of transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Surface Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Fluorescence for Detecting Sub&#8208;Millimeter&#8208;Sized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) fluorescent probe with high brightness is developed. Both the actively and passively targeted imaging probes can locate tumors in vivo with similar intratumor distributions in an SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer model. In addition, these SWIR imaging probes are able to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumor nodules, making them excellent candidates for fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) enables in vivo imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and penetration depth due to the reduced tissue autofluorescence and decreased photon scattering at long wavelengths. Although small organic SWIR dye molecules have excellent biocompatibility, they have been rarely exploited as compared to their inorganic counterparts, mainly due to their low quantum yield. To increase their brightness, in this work, the SWIR dye molecules are placed in close proximity to gold nanorods (AuNRs) for surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced emission. The fluorescence enhancement is optimized by controlling the dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio and up to &#8776;45&#8208;fold enhancement factor is achieved. In addition, the results indicate that the highest dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio gives the highest emission intensity per weight and this is used for synthesizing SWIR imaging probes using layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) technique with polymer coating protection. Then, the SWIR imaging probes are applied for in vivo imaging of ovarian cancer and the surface coating effect on intratumor distribution of the imaging probes is investigated in two orthotopic ovarian cancer models. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the plasmon&#8208;enhanced SWIR imaging probe has great potential for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery by showing its capability to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumors.

         <title>Buried Interfaces in Halide Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

         <dc:description>
The mystery of the buried interface in perovskite photovoltaics is deciphered by combining advanced spectroscopy techniques with a lift&#8208;off strategy. The findings open a new avenue to understanding performance losses and thus the design of unique passivation strategies to remove imperfections at the top surfaces and buried interfaces of perovskite photovoltaics, resulting in substantial enhancement in device performance.








Abstract
Understanding the fundamental properties of buried interfaces in perovskite photovoltaics is of paramount importance to the enhancement of device efficiency and stability. Nevertheless, accessing buried interfaces poses a sizeable challenge because of their non&#8208;exposed feature. Herein, the mystery of the buried interface in full device stacks is deciphered by combining advanced in situ spectroscopy techniques with a facile lift&#8208;off strategy. By establishing the microstructure&#8211;property relations, the basic losses at the contact interfaces are systematically presented, and it is found that the buried interface losses induced by both the sub&#8208;microscale extended imperfections and lead&#8208;halide inhomogeneities are major roadblocks toward improvement of device performance. The losses can be considerably mitigated by the use of a passivation&#8208;molecule&#8208;assisted microstructural reconstruction, which unlocks the full potential for improving device performance. The findings open a new avenue to understanding performance losses and thus the design of new passivation strategies to remove imperfections at the top surfaces and buried interfaces of perovskite photovoltaics, resulting in substantial enhancement in device performance.

Blending the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) with the layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 in solution phase facilitates the formation of large and near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like perovskite domains overlaid by a thin layer of the organic molecule. Transistors utilizing the (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT bilayer as the channel exhibit unexpectedly large hysteresis, and their use as a non&#8208;volatile memory element is demonstrated.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of metal halide perovskite layers during processing is critical for the manufacturing of optoelectronics. Here, a strategy to control the microstructure of solution&#8208;processed layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite films based on phenethylammonium lead bromide ((PEA)2PbBr4) is reported. The method relies on the addition of the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) into the perovskite formulation, where it facilitates the formation of large, near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like (PEA)2PbBr4 domains overlaid by a &#8776;5&#8208;nm&#8208;thin C8&#8208;BTBT layer. Transistors with (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT channels exhibit an unexpectedly large hysteresis window between forward and return bias sweeps. Material and device analysis combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the C8&#8208;BTBT&#8208;rich phase acts as the hole&#8208;transporting channel, while the quantum wells in (PEA)2PbBr4 act as the charge storage element where carriers from the channel are injected, stored, or extracted via tunneling.&#160;When tested as a non&#8208;volatile memory, the devices exhibit a record memory window (&gt;180&#160;V), a high erase/write channel current ratio (104), good data retention, and high endurance (&gt;104 cycles). The results here highlight a new memory device concept for application in large&#8208;area electronics, while the growth technique can potentially be exploited for the development of other optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodetectors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Activatable Photo&#8208;Extracellular Vesicle for Synergistic Trimodal Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;extracellular vesicles are constructed by loading M1&#8208;macrophage&#8208;derived EVs with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate, chlorin e6, and prodrug aldoxorubicin. These skillfully engineered extracellular vesicles can actively target tumors owing to their inherent tumor&#8208;homing ability, wherein they exhibit potent trimodal therapy effects in an intersynergistic and self&#8208;controllable way, attributed to the interaction between the engineered EV and the special tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential in both disease treatment and drug delivery. However, accurate drug release from EVs, as well as the spontaneous treatment effect cooperation of EVs and drugs at target tissues, is still challenging. Here, an engineered self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;EV for synergistic trimodal anticancer therapy is reported. M1 macrophage&#8208;derived EVs (M1 EVs) are simultaneously loaded with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl) phenyl] oxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and prodrug aldoxorubicin (Dox&#8208;EMCH). After administration, the as&#8208;prepared system actively targets tumor cells because of the tumor&#8208;homing capability of M1 EVs, wherein M1 EVs repolarize M2 to M1 macrophages, which not only display immunotherapy effects but also produce H2O2. The reaction between H2O2 and CPPO generates chemical energy that activates Ce6, creating both chemiluminescence for imaging and singlet oxygen (1O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meanwhile, 1O2&#8208;induced membrane rupture leads to the release of Dox&#8208;EMCH, which is then activated and penetrates the deep hypoxic areas of tumors. The synergism of immunotherapy, PDT, and chemotherapy results in potent anticancer efficacy, showing great promise to fight cancers.

         <title>A Programmable DNA&#8208;Silicification&#8208;Based Nanocavity for Single&#8208;Molecule Plasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating advances in DNA nanotechnology and plasmonic sensing, this study reports a method, termed DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), for development of ultrasmall and structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity. The DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs exhibit large, controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement for reproducible single&#8208;molecule surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic sensing even at elevated background concentrations.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanocavities are highly desirable for optical sensing because of their singular ability to confine light into deep subwavelength volumes. Yet, it remains profoundly challenging to fabricate structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity, and to obtain direct, noninvasive visualization of the plasmonic hotspots within such constructs. Herein, highly precise and robust nanocavities, entitled DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), are engineered by using silicified DNA scaffolds for spatial organization of discrete plasmonic nanoparticles. In addition to substantially enhancing structural stability and chemical inertness, DNA silicification significantly improves nanogap control, resulting simultaneously in large and controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement. The ultrasmall mode volume of the DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs promotes single&#8208;molecule occupancy enabling surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) observations of single&#8208;molecule activity even at elevated background concentration, significantly relaxing the restrictive pico&#8208; to nanomolar molecular concentration condition typically required for such investigations. Additionally, leveraging super&#8208;resolution SERS measurements allows noninvasive and diffraction&#8208;unlimited spatial profiling of otherwise unresolvable plasmonic hotspots. The highly programmable and reproducible nature of the DNA&#8208;STROBE, coupled with its quantitative label&#8208;free molecular readouts, provides a versatile platform with applications across the spectrum of nanophotonics and biomedical sciences.

         <title>Sensing of COVID&#8208;19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Nanoprinted Reduced&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Coated 3D Electrodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A ten&#8208;second COVID&#8208;19 antibody test is developed, which represents the fastest detection of this pathogenic biomarker. The test uses 3D nanoprinted electrodes coated with reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide and viral antigens. The COVID&#8208;19 sensor can be reused 9 times and is connected to a smartphone interface for a convenient readout. This sensing technology is a powerful tool that will greatly benefit public health.








Abstract
Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. An advanced nanomaterial&#8208;based biosensing platform that&#160;detects COVID&#8208;19 antibodies within seconds is reported. The biosensing platform is created by 3D nanoprinting of three&#8208;dimensional electrodes, coating the electrodes by nanoflakes of&#160;reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#160;(rGO), and immobilizing specific viral antigens on the rGO nanoflakes. The electrode is then integrated with a microfluidic device and used in a standard electrochemical cell. When antibodies are introduced on the electrode surface, they selectively bind with the antigens, changing the impedance of the electrical circuit which is detected via impedance spectroscopy. Antibodies to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and its&#160;receptor&#8208;binding&#8208;domain (RBD)&#160;are detected&#160;at a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 2.8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 and 16.9&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 m,&#160;respectively,&#160;and read by a smartphone&#8208;based user interface. The sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low&#8208;pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive&#160;sensing&#160;of&#160;test&#160;samples using the same sensor. Sensing of S1 and RBD antibodies is specific, which cross&#8208;reacts neither with other antibodies such as RBD, S1, and nucleocapsid antibody nor with proteins such as interleukin&#8208;6. The proposed sensing platform could also be useful to detect biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika.

         <title>Self&#8208;Amplifying Nanotherapeutic Drugs Homing to Tumors in a Manner of Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting nanodrug with self&#8208;amplifying effects based on a chain reaction mechanism is developed. The nanodrug can activate more drug&#8208;accessible targets for effectively homing itself to tumors in large amount. In addition, it can be used as a nanocarrier to selectively deliver other drugs to tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its high tumor&#8208;targeting ability and antitumor effect.








Abstract
Active tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery has great potency in cancer therapy. However, the targeting efficiency of traditional active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs is limited by the scarcity of their accessible targets/receptors in tumors. Here, a novel self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy with a chain reaction mechanism is developed. A coagulation targeting peptide (GNQEQVSPLTLLKXC, termed A15)&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;maleimide poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 conjugate (A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4) is prepared to obtain a self&#8208;amplifying nanotherapeutic platform homing to tumors. After administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 starts a chain reaction cycle consisting of intratumoral hemorrhage, target FXIIIa amplification, blood clot binding, and CA4 release in tumors. In this way, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 increases the level of its accessible targets (FXIIIa) in a manner of chain reaction. The FXIIIa activity at 8&#160;h is 4.1&#8208;fold more than the one at 0&#160;h in the C26 tumors treated with A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4. The total CA4 concentration at 24&#160;h is 2.9&#8208;fold more than the control. A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 shows a significantly higher antitumor effect against large C26 tumors (&#8776;500&#160;mm3) thanks to the remarkable tumor&#8208;targeting ability compared with the control. Therefore, this report highlights the potential of the self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy in the development of next generation active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs for tumor therapy.

         <title>Structure Design of Long&#8208;Life Spinel&#8208;Oxide Cathode Materials for Magnesium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect spinel ZnMnO3 with cation deficiencies at octahedral sites allows highly reversible Mg insertion/extraction avoiding the irreversible transformation into a rocksalt phase. It is successfully demonstrated that the material can work as a high&#8208;performance cathode for magnesium rechargeable batteries exhibiting high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) with long&#8208;term cyclability.








Abstract
Development of metal&#8208;anode rechargeable batteries is a challenging issue. Especially, magnesium rechargeable batteries are promising in that Mg metal can be free from dendrite formation upon charging. However, in case of oxide cathode materials, inserted magnesium tends to form MgO&#8208;like rocksalt clusters in a parent phase even with another structure, which causes poor cyclability. Here, a design concept of high&#8208;performance cathode materials is shown, based on: i) selecting an element to destabilize the rocksalt&#8208;type structure and ii) utilizing the defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type structure both to avoid the spinel&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt reaction and to secure the migration path of Mg cations. This theoretical and experimental work substantiates that a defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type ZnMnO3 meets the above criteria and shows excellent cycle performance exceeding 100 cycles upon Mg insertion/extraction with high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Thus, this work would provide a design guideline of cathode materials for various multivalent rechargeable batteries.

Thus, this work would provide a design guideline of cathode materials for various multivalent rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mirroring Action Potentials: Label&#8208;Free, Accurate, and Noninvasive Electrophysiological Recordings of Human&#8208;Derived Cardiomyocytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrophysiology paradigm transduces cellular action potentials into optical signals by mirroring the cellular ionic currents into the motion of fluorophores in a separate fluid. The resulting optical signals (mirror action potentials) offer an accurate, noninvasive measurement of the cells&#8217; action potentials. This methodology, successfully tested on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes, is an ideal candidate for noninvasive optical drug screenings.








Abstract
The electrophysiological recording of action potentials in human cells is a long&#8208;sought objective due to its pivotal importance in many disciplines. Among the developed techniques, invasiveness remains a common issue, causing cytotoxicity or altering unpredictably cell physiological response. In this work, a new approach for recording intracellular signals of outstanding quality and with noninvasiveness is introduced. By taking profit of the concept of mirror charge in classical electrodynamics, the new proposed device transduces cell ionic currents into mirror charges in a microfluidic chamber, thus realizing a virtual mirror cell. By monitoring mirror charge dynamics, it is possible to effectively record the action potentials fired by the cells. Since there is no need for accessing or interacting with the cells, the method is intrinsically noninvasive. In addition, being based on optical recording, it shows high spatial resolution and high parallelization. As shown through a set of experiments, the presented methodology is an ideal candidate for the next generation devices for the reliable assessment of cardiotoxicity on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes. More generally, it paves the way toward a new family of in vitro biodevices that will lay a new milestone in the field of electrophysiology.

         <title>Perovskite Quantum Wells Formation Mechanism for Stable Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics&#8212;A Real&#8208;Time Phase&#8208;Transition Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation coating and perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)/3D architecture formation mechanism. With fluorinated poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transport layer, this PQWs/3D architecture leads to stable perovskite photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency of &gt;22%.








Abstract
The combination of a bulk 3D perovskite layer and a reduced dimensional perovskite layer (perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)) is demonstrated to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly in terms of stability and efficiency. This perovskite hierarchy has attracted intensive research interest; however, the in&#8208;depth formation mechanism of perovskite quantum wells on top of a 3D perovskite layer is not clearly understood and is therefore the focus of this study. Along with ex situ morphology and photophysical characterization, the time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (TS&#8208;GIWAXS) technique performed in this study provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation (HTAB ligand molecule) coating and PQWs/3D architecture formation process. A strikingly strong ionic reaction between the 3D perovskite and the long&#8208;chain organic cation leads to the quick formation of an ordered intermediate phase within only a few seconds. The optimal PQWs/3D&#160;architecture is achieved by controlling the HTAB casting, which is assisted by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight SIMS characterization. By controlling the second ionic reaction during the long&#8208;chain cation coating process, along with the fluorinated&#160;poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole&#8208;transport layer, the perovskite solar cells demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 22% along with drastically improved device stability.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembled Programmable Nanomedicine As In Situ Cancer Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>

A novel strategy to use programmable nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy is presented. A programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) is constructed through supramolecular modular assembly, which automatically transforms after intravenous injection and finishes sequential multiple steps for eliciting robust immune responses in vivo.








Abstract
Using nanotechnology for improving the immunotherapy efficiency represents a major research interest in recent years. However, there are paradoxes and obstacles in using a single nanoparticle to fulfill all the requirements in the complicated immune activation processes. Herein, a supramolecular assembled programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) for sequentially finishing multiple steps after intravenous injection and eliciting robust antitumor immunity in situ is reported. The programmable nanomedicine is constructed by supramolecular assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions between poly&#8208;[(N&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;aspartamide]&#8208;Pt(IV)/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PPCD), CpG/polyamidoamine&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (CpG/PAMAM&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad), and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (mPEG&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad). After intravenous injection and accumulation at the tumor site, the high level of reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment promotes PIAN dissociation and the release of PPCD (mediating tumor cell killing and antigen release) and CpG/PAMAM (mediating antigen capturing and transferring to the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes). This results in antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation, antigen presentation, and robust antitumor immune responses. In combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the PIAN cures 40% of mice in a colorectal cancer model. This PIAN provides a new framework for designing programmable nanomedicine as in situ cancer vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Library of Atomically Thin 2D Materials Featuring the Conductive&#8208;Point Resistive Switching Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The library of atomically thin 2D materials featuring non&#8208;volatile resistive switching can provide a promising and broad platform for exploring the sub&#8208;nanometer scaling limit, which is beneficial for emerging device concepts. A dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption (DDA) model is proposed to describe the common conductive&#8208;point mechanism behind 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based universal resistive switching and supported by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing favorable adsorption of metal into native defects.








Abstract
Non&#8208;volatile resistive switching (NVRS) is a widely available effect in transitional metal oxides, colloquially known as memristors, and of broad interest for memory technology and neuromorphic computing. Until recently, NVRS was not known in other transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an important material class owing to their atomic thinness enabling the ultimate dimensional scaling. Here, various monolayer or few&#8208;layer 2D&#160;materials are presented in the conventional vertical structure that exhibit NVRS, including TMDs (MX2, M = transitional metal, e.g., Mo, W, Re, Sn, or Pt; X = chalcogen, e.g., S, Se, or Te), TMD heterostructure (WS2/MoS2), and an atomically thin insulator (h&#8208;BN). These results indicate the universality of the phenomenon in 2D non&#8208;conductive materials, and feature low switching voltage, large ON/OFF ratio, and forming&#8208;free characteristic. A&#160;dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption model is proposed, attributing the enhanced conductance to metal atoms/ions adsorption into intrinsic vacancies, a conductive&#8208;point mechanism supported by first&#8208;principle calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy characterizations. The results motivate further research in the understanding and applications of defects in 2D materials.

         <title>Hidden Vacancy Benefit in Monolayer 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual benefit of vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors is enhancing their charge transport properties of a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction mechanism, to push the performance limit of atomically thin transistors with record&#8208;setting performance metrics.








Abstract
Monolayer 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) are of considerable interest for atomically thin transistors but generally limited by insufficient carrier mobility or driving current. Minimizing the lattice defects in 2D semiconductors represents a common strategy to improve their electronic properties, but has met with limited success to date. Herein, a hidden benefit of the atomic vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors to push their performance limit is reported. By purposely tailoring the sulfur vacancies (SVs) to an optimum density of 4.7% in monolayer MoS2, an unusual mobility enhancement is obtained and a record&#8208;high carrier mobility (&gt;115 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) is achieved, realizing monolayer MoS2 transistors with an exceptional current density (&gt;0.60&#160;mA &#181;m&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high on/off ratio &gt;1010,&#160;and enabling a logic inverter with an ultrahigh voltage gain &gt;100.&#160;The systematic transport studies reveal that the counterintuitive vacancy&#8208;enhanced transport originates from a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction model, in which an optimum SV density is essential for maximizing the charge hopping probability. Lastly, the vacancy benefit into other monolayer 2D semiconductors is further generalized; thus, a general strategy for tailoring the charge transport properties of monolayer materials is defined.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Inhaled Immunotherapeutics for Treating Lung Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS with adjuvant effect is able to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPDL1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Despite the critical breakthrough achieved by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the clinical benefits are usually restricted by inefficient infiltration of immune cells and immune&#8208;associated adverse effects. Noninvasive aerosol inhalation, as a definitive procedure for treatment of respiratory diseases, for ICB immunotherapy against lung metastasis, has not been realized to the best knowledge. Herein, an inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS is used as a carrier to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery. Moreover, CS exhibits adjuvant effects to drive potent immune responses via activating the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Interestingly, repeated inhalation of CS/aPD&#8208;L1 complex can effectively activate the immune system by promoting the infiltration of different immune cells especially CD8+ T cells around tumor lesions, and finally prolongs the survival of mice to 60 days. Thus, the work presents a unique aerosol inhalation delivery system for ICB antibody, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.

         <title>Nanoassemblies with Effective Serum Tolerance Capability Achieving Robust Gene Silencing Efficacy for Breast Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modification is proposed for constructing cationic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based siRNA vectors with enhanced serum resistance. This PEG modification strategy does not consume free aminos of the cationic polymers. The constructed siRNA vectors show robust gene silencing efficacy in the absence and presence of serum. In vivo, these vectors exhibit excellent antitumor effects and good biocompatibility.








Abstract
The transfection efficiency of siRNA mediated by cationic polymers is limited due to the instability of polymers/siRNA complexes in the presence of serum. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually applied to modify cationic polymers, so as to reduce protein and cell adsorption and then to improve siRNA transfection efficiency. However, the polymers&#8217; modification with PEG mostly consumes the free amino of the polymers, which can, in turn, reduce the charge density and limit their siRNA transfection efficacy. Here, a new PEG modification strategy that need not consume the surface aminos of polymers is proposed. Catechol&#8211;PEG polymers are coated on the surface of phenylboronic acid (PBA)&#8208;modified Generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5PBA) via reversible boronate esters to establish PEG&#8208;modified dendrimer/siRNA nanoassemblies for efficient siRNA delivery. The PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies have positive charge and show excellent gene silencing efficacy in the absence of serum in vitro. More importantly, the PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies also exhibit excellent serum resistance and gene silencing efficacy in serum&#8208;containing medium. Furthermore, the effective antiserum and gene silencing efficacy elicited by these nanoassemblies lead to excellent antitumor effects in vivo. This proposed strategy constitutes an important approach to reach an excellent gene silencing efficacy in the presence of serum.

         <title>Thermoelectric Materials: Thermoelectric Properties of Novel Semimetals: A Case Study of YbMnSb2 (Adv. Mater. 7/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2003168, Yu Pan, Chenguang Fu, Claudia Felser, and co&#8208;workers investigate the thermoelectric properties of a novel nodal line semimetal, YbMnSb2. The Dirac bands guarantee high charge&#8208;carrier mobility, and, simultaneously, a regular band provides a large density of states leading to a large thermopower. The power factor of single&#8208;crystal YbMnSb2 is found to be competitive with conventional high&#8208;performance thermoelectric semiconductors, even binary Bi2Te3 single crystals.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004234, Francesco De Angelis and co&#8208;workers report a radically new paradigm for cellular electrophysiological recording with no need of cell&#8208;membrane poration. Cells are cultured on floating pads, which electrically connect the cell culture to a dispersion of charged fluorophores. By mirroring cellular ionic currents, cell action potentials are transduced into optical signals, called mirror action potentials. The proposed method, successfully tested on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes, stands out for its high accuracy and non&#8208;invasiveness.

         <dc:description>
Photodetectors (PDs) based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted burgeoning interest for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional MHP&#8208;based PDs are summarized, including the synthesis, fundamental properties, performance, and stability issues. By discussing practical strategies and existing challenges, perspectives on low&#8208;dimensional MHP PDs for improved future performance and stability are provided.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been a hot research topic due to their facile synthesis, excellent optical and optoelectronic properties, and record&#8208;breaking efficiency of corresponding optoelectronic devices. Nowadays, the development of miniaturized high&#8208;performance photodetectors (PDs) has been fueling the demand for novel photoactive materials, among which low&#8208;dimensional MHPs have attracted burgeoning research interest. In this report, the synthesis, properties, photodetection performance, and stability of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs, including 0D, 1D, 2D layered and nonlayered nanostructures, as well as their heterostructures are reviewed. Recent advances in the synthesis approaches of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs are summarized and the key concepts for understanding the optical and optoelectronic properties related to the PD applications of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs are introduced. More importantly, recent progress in novel PDs based on low&#8208;dimensional MHPs is presented, and strategies for improving the performance and stability of perovskite PDs are highlighted. By discussing recent advances, strategies, and existing challenges, this progress report provides perspectives on low&#8208;dimensional MHP&#8208;based PDs in the future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of emerging potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). The research progress on electrolytes of PIBs is summarized in terms of fundamental properties, optimization of electrolyte components and engineering of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, providing a comprehensive guidance on designing more suitable electrolytes for high&#8208;performance PIBs.








Abstract
Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are recognized as one promising candidate for future energy storage devices due to their merits of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;power operation. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of electrode materials and the progress has been well summarized in recent review papers. However, in addition to electrode materials, electrolytes also play a key role in determining the cell performance. Here, the research progress of electrolytes in PIBs is summarized, including organic liquid electrolytes, ionic liquid electrolytes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes and aqueous electrolytes, and the engineering of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces is also thoroughly discussed. This Progress Report provides a comprehensive guidance on the design of electrolyte systems for development of high performance PIBs.

         <title>Recent Progress in Solution&#8208;Based Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 7, February 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;based metal oxide thin films allow the achievement of ultralow power and high&#8208;density resistive switching devices by using low&#8208;cost and simple processes being compatible with large&#8208;area manufacturing required by the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things. To enhance the performance of solution&#8208;based resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM), some challenges such as stability and reproducibility can be surpassed by controlling the metal oxide synthesis parameters.








Abstract
Metal oxide resistive switching memories have been a crucial component for the requirements of the Internet of Things, which demands ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density devices with new computing principles, exploiting low cost green products and technologies. Most of the reported resistive switching devices use conventional methods (physical and chemical vapor deposition), which are quite expensive due to their up&#8208;scale production. Solution&#8208;processing methods have been improved, being now a reliable technology that offers many advantages for resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) such as high versatility, large area uniformity, transparency, low&#8208;cost and a simple fabrication of two&#8208;terminal structures. Solution&#8208;based metal oxide RRAM devices are emergent and promising non&#8208;volatile memories for future electronics. In this review, a brief history of non&#8208;volatile memories is highlighted as well as the present status of solution&#8208;based metal oxide resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM). Then, a focus on describing the solution synthesis parameters of S&#8208;RRAMs which induce a massive influence in the overall performance of these devices is discussed. Next, a precise analysis is performed on the metal oxide thin film and electrode interface and the recent advances on S&#8208;RRAM that will allow their large&#8208;area manufacturing. Finally, the figures of merit and the main challenges in S&#8208;RRAMs are discussed and future trends are proposed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Halide Perovskites for Polarized Luminescence and Detection: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments and advanced understanding of polarization&#8208;sensitive halide perovskites are comprehensively reviewed, involving linear/circular polarization luminescence and detection. Also, the key challenges and current opportunities in the field are discussed. The great promise of polarization&#8208;sensitive halide perovskites is addressed to inspire other potential applications in opotoelectronics.








Abstract
While halide perovskites (HPs) have achieved enormous success in the field of optoelectronic applications, much attention has been recently drawn to the unique polarization sensitivity of HPs, either intrinsic or extrinsic, which makes HPs a potential candidate for innovative applications in directly polarized luminescence and detection. Herein, the research status in the field of polarization&#8208;sensitive HPs, including linear polarization and circular polarization, is comprehensively summarized. To evaluate the effectiveness of HPs in generating and detecting linearly or circularly polarized light, the principles and characterization methods of polarized luminescence and detection are introduced. Sequentially, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development of the strategies that induce the linear or circular polarization characteristics of HPs is systematically reviewed, based on which the application of polarization&#8208;sensitive HPs in the field of polarization luminescence and detection are summarized. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities are discussed, and prospects of the future development in this promising field are outlined.

         <title>Advanced Nanomaterials for Preparedness Against (Re&#8208;)Emerging Viral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials have a significant potential for creating sophisticated complexes, mimicking the natural size and structures of viruses without the complications of toxicity. New approaches for applying advanced nanomaterial&#8208;based platform technologies to future diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral treatments against emerging infectious diseases are reviewed. The unmet needs and future directions of current nanomaterial&#8208;based tools in the clinical settings are also addressed.








Abstract
While the coronavirus disease (COVID&#8208;19) accounts for the current global pandemic, the emergence of other unknown pathogens, named &#8220;Disease X,&#8221; remains a serious concern in the future. Emerging or re&#8208;emerging pathogens continue to pose significant challenges to global public health. In response, the scientific community has been urged to create advanced platform technologies to meet the ever&#8208;increasing needs presented by these devastating diseases with pandemic potential. This review aims to bring new insights to allow for the application of advanced nanomaterials in future diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral therapies, thereby addressing the challenges associated with the current preparedness strategies in clinical settings against viruses. The application of nanomaterials has advanced medicine and provided cutting&#8208;edge solutions for unmet needs. Herein, an overview of the currently available nanotechnologies is presented, highlighting the significant features that enable them to control infectious diseases, and identifying the challenges that remain to be addressed for the commercial production of nano&#8208;based products is presented. Finally, to conclude, the development of a nanomaterial&#8208;based system using a &#8220;One Health&#8221; approach is suggested. This strategy would require a transdisciplinary collaboration and communication between all stakeholders throughout the entire process spanning across research and development, as well as the preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing phases.

         <title>Modeling Electron&#8208;Transfer Degradation of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operational lifetime of an organic electroluminescence device is governed by the intrinsic degradation of its constituent materials. A chemical and numerical model capable of predicting the operational stability of emitting layers exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence is established. Thereby guidelines of choosing materials toward the improved device lifetime are provided.








Abstract
The operational lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) is governed primarily by the intrinsic degradation of the materials. Therefore, a chemical model capable of predicting the operational stability is highly important. Here, a degradation model for OLEDs that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is constructed and validated. The degradation model involves Langevin recombination of charge carriers on hosts, followed by the generation of a polaron pair through reductive electron transfer from a dopant to a host exciton as the initiation steps. The polarons undergo spontaneous decomposition, which competes with ultrafast recovery of the intact materials through charge recombination. Electrical and spectroscopic investigations provide information about the kinetics of each step in the operation and degradation of the devices, thereby enabling the building of mass balances for the key species in the emitting layers. Numerical solutions enable predictions of temporal decreases of the dopant concentration in various TADF emitting layers. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental operational stabilities. This research disentangles the chemical processes in intrinsic electron&#8208;transfer degradation, and provides a useful foundation for improving the longevity of OLEDs.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator, which endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance, remarkable cycling stability, and high actual energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under practical pouch cell conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, where soluble lithium polysulfides are crucial in the Li&#8211;S electrochemistry as intrinsic redox mediators. However, the poor mediation capability of the intrinsic polysulfide mediators leads to sluggish redox kinetics, further rendering limited rate performances, low discharge capacity, and rapid capacity decay. Here, an organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator. DPDSe spontaneously reacts with lithium polysulfides to generate lithium phenylseleno polysulfides (LiPhSePSs) with improved redox mediation capability. The as&#8208;generated LiPhSePSs afford faster sulfur redox kinetics and increase the deposition dimension of lithium sulfide. Consequently, the DPDSe comediator endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance of 817&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 2 C and remarkable cycling stability with limited anode excess. Moreover, Li&#8211;S pouch cells with the DPDSe comediator achieve an actual initial energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 30 stable cycles. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy with an effective organodiselenide comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under pouch cell conditions and inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Chlorinated Spiroconjugated Fused Extended Aromatics for Multifunctional Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecule, SFIC&#8208;Cl, featured by enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization by fused&#8208;spiroconjugation and narrowed bandgap by chlorination, is constructed, and is integrated into single&#8208;crystal transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and organic photovoltaics. This study demonstrates that these chlorinated spiroconjugated fused systems offer a novel direction toward development of high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for hybrid organic electronic devices.








Abstract
The synthesis of a new molecule, SFIC&#8208;Cl, is reported, which features enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization by spiroconjugation and narrowed bandgap by chlorination. SFIC&#8208;Cl is integrated into a single&#8208;crystal transistor (OFET) and organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED). The material demonstrates remarkable transport abilities across various solution&#8208;processed OFETs and retains efficient radiance in a near&#8208;infrared OLED emitting light at 700&#160;nm. Furthermore, the intermolecular multi&#8208;dimensional connection of SFIC&#8208;Cl enables the fabrication of a single&#8208;component large&#8208;area (2 &#215; 2&#160;cm2) near&#8208;infrared OLED by spin&#8208;coating. The SFIC&#8208;Cl&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based solar cell shows excellent power conversion efficiency of 10.16% resulting from the broadened and strong absorption and well&#8208;matched energy levels. The study demonstrates that chlorinated spiroconjugated fused systems offer a novel direction toward the development of high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for hybrid organic electronic devices.

         <title>Emerging Opportunities for 2D Semiconductor/Ferroelectric Transistor&#8208;Structure Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between 2D semiconductors and ferroelectrics results in new functionalities, which could be expected to deliver massively enhanced device performance for existing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies and add unprecedented applications for next&#8208;generation electronics. Recent progress in using 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric hybrid structures to enable a rich variety of emerging device concepts is critically reviewed.








Abstract
Semiconductor technology, which is rapidly evolving, is poised to enter a new era for which revolutionary innovations are needed to address fundamental limitations on material and working principle level. 2D semiconductors inherently holding novel properties at the atomic limit show great promise to tackle challenges imposed by traditional bulk semiconductor materials. Synergistic combination of 2D semiconductors with functional ferroelectrics further offers new working principles, and is expected to deliver massively enhanced device performance for existing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies and add unprecedented applications for next&#8208;generation electronics. Herein, recent demonstrations of novel device concepts based on 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric heterostructures are critically reviewed covering their working mechanisms, device construction, applications, and challenges. In particular, emerging opportunities of CMOS&#8208;process&#8208;compatible 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric transistor structure devices for the development of a rich variety of applications are discussed, including beyond&#8208;Boltzmann transistors, nonvolatile memories, neuromorphic devices, and reconfigurable nanodevices such as p&#8211;n homojunctions and self&#8208;powered photodetectors. It is concluded that 2D semiconductor/ferroelectric heterostructures, as an emergent heterogeneous platform, could drive many more exciting innovations for modern electronics, beyond the capability of ubiquitous silicon systems.

         <title>Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. Relevant theories, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic 2D ferroelectrics, are outlined. Further, the existing challenges and prospects of the exploration in 2D ferroelectrics are also discussed, which should provide unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, and valleytronics.








Abstract
Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D&#160;ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D&#160;ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory&#8208;validated 2D ferroelectric&#8208;based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Interfacial Atomistic Mechanisms of Lithium Metal Stripping and Plating in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery is a key research direction for next&#8208;generation batteries. Using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the detailed atomistic mechanism and interface failure of the lithium metal anode during lithium cycling are revealed. A guiding map and new strategies are provided for the selection and improvement of solid interfaces in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries based on a Li metal anode represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage system, but are currently limited by low current density and short cycle life. Further research to improve the Li metal anode is impeded by the lack of understanding in its failure mechanisms at lithium&#8211;solid interfaces, in particular, the fundamental atomistic processes responsible for interface failure. Here, using large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations, the first atomistic modeling study of lithium stripping and plating on a solid electrolyte is performed by explicitly considering key fundamental atomistic processes and interface atomistic structures. In the simulations, the interface failure initiated with the formation of nano&#8208;sized pores, and how interface structures, lithium diffusion, adhesion energy, and applied pressure affect interface failure during Li cycling are observed. By systematically varying the parameters of solid&#8208;state lithium cells in the simulations, the parameter space of applied pressures and interfacial adhesion energies that inhibit interface failure during cycling are mapped to guide selection of solid&#8208;state cells. This study establishes the atomistic modeling for Li stripping and plating, and predicts optimal solid interfaces and new strategies for the future research and development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Operando Magnetometry Probing the Charge Storage Mechanism of CoO Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge storage mechanisms in CoO lithium&#8208;ion batteries are demonstrated, based on the interpretation of the results of the operando magnetometry. They involve the well&#8208;known conversion reactions, the formation of a spin capacitor, and the growth of polymeric films. More importantly, direct evidence strongly supporting the catalytic role of metallic Co in assisting the polymeric film formation is obtained.








Abstract
Cobalt oxide (CoO) is a promising electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), where the charge storage is believed to take place solely during the electrochemical oxidation/reduction processes. However, this simple picture has been increasingly challenged by reported anomalously large storage capacities, indicating the existence of undiscovered extra charge reservoirs inside the system. Here, an advanced operando magnetometry technology is employed to monitor the magnetization variation of the CoO LIBs in real time and, in this particular system, it is clearly demonstrated that the anomalous capacity is associated with both the reversible formation of a spin capacitor and the growth of a polymeric film at low voltages. Furthermore, operando magnetometry provides direct evidence of the catalytic role of metallic Co in assisting the polymeric film formation. These critical findings help pave the way for better understanding of the charge storage mechanisms of transition&#8208;metal oxides and further utilizing them to design novel electrode materials.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Gradient Ionogels for Highly Sensitive, Broad&#8208;Range&#8208;Response, and Freeze/Heat&#8208;Resistant Ionic Fingers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by gradient modulus distribution of human fingers, the gradient ionogels are prepared by an electric field&#8208;induced cationic crosslinkers migration strategy. The gradient of modulus distribution enables the gradient ionogel&#8208;based flexible sensors high sensitivity and broader&#8208;range detection simultaneously. Moreover, the flexible iontronic sensors also show good long&#8208;time stability and excellent performance over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Human fingers exhibit both high sensitivity and wide tactile range. The finger skin structures are designed to display gradient microstructures and compressibility. Inspired by the gradient mechanical Young's modulus distribution, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced cationic crosslinker migration strategy is demonstrated to prepare gradient ionogels. Due to the gradient of the crosslinkers, the ionogels exhibit more than four orders of magnitude difference between the anode and the cathode side, enabling gradient ionogel&#8208;based flexible iontronic sensors having high&#8208;sensitivity and broader&#8208;range detection (from 3 &#215; 102 to 2.5 &#215; 106&#160;Pa) simultaneously. Moreover, owing to the remarkable properties of the gradient ionogels, the flexible iontronic sensors also show good long&#8208;time stability (even after 10 000 cycles loadings) and excellent performance over a wide temperature range (from &#8722;108 to 300 &#176;C). The flexible iontronic sensors are further integrated on soft grips, exhibiting remarkable performance under various conditions. These attractive features demonstrate that gradient ionogels will be promising candidates for smart sensor applications in complex and extreme conditions.

         <title>Electrically Insulating Flexible Films with Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Fillers as Efficient Electromagnetic Shields in the GHz and Sub&#8208;THz Frequency Bands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer composite films with fillers of exfoliated quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials are described. Such composites with low loadings of TaSe3 reveal excellent electromagnetic shielding in the GHz and sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining electrically insulating. These novel films are promising for communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and insulating.








Abstract
Polymer composite films containing fillers comprising quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals materials, specifically transition metal trichalcogenides with 1D&#160;structural motifs that enable their exfoliation into bundles of atomic threads, are reported. These nanostructures are characterized by extremely large aspect ratios of up to &#8776;106. The polymer composites with low loadings of quasi&#8208;1D TaSe3 fillers (&lt;3&#160;vol%) reveal excellent electromagnetic interference shielding in the X&#8208;band GHz and extremely high frequency sub&#8208;THz frequency ranges, while remaining DC electrically insulating. The unique electromagnetic shielding characteristics of these films are attributed to effective coupling of the electromagnetic waves to the high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio electrically conductive TaSe3 atomic&#8208;thread bundles even when the filler concentration is below the electrical percolation threshold. These novel films are promising for high&#8208;frequency communication technologies, which require electromagnetic shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and electrically insulating.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for In Situ Construction of Highly Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase to Enable High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrolyte design strategy for in situ solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) construction is proposed in aqueous Zn chemistry to stabilize the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interface. Apart from the realization of high Zn reversibility and utilization, the exploitation of the robust in situ SEI enables significantly enhanced cyclability of Zn/V2O5 full cells under practical conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries promise high capacity, low cost, high safety, and sustainability for large&#8208;scale energy storage. The Zn metal anode, however, suffers from the dendrite growth and side reactions that are mainly due to the absence of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, the in situ formation of a dense, stable, and highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI layer (hopeite) in aqueous Zn chemistry is demonstrated, by introducing Zn(H2PO4)2 salt into the electrolyte. The hopeite SEI (&#8776;140&#160;nm thickness) enables uniform and rapid Zn&#8208;ion transport kinetics for dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and restrains the side reactions via isolating active Zn from the bulk electrolyte. Under practical testing conditions with an ultrathin Zn anode (10&#160;&#181;m), a low negative/positive capacity ratio (&#8776;2.3), and a lean electrolyte (9&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), the Zn/V2O5 full cell retains 94.4% of its original capacity after 500 cycles. This work provides a simple yet practical solution to high&#8208;performance aqueous battery technology via building in situ SEI layers.

         <title>3D Metallic Structures: A Review on Micro/Nanoforming to Fabricate 3D Metallic Structures (Adv. Mater. 6/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2000893, Debin Shan, Bin Guo, and co&#8208;workers survey the recent progress of micro/nano forming techniques for fabricating 3D metallic structures. The complex interplay among the factors that influence the so&#8208;called size effect occurs in terms of materials, processes, tools and machines during micro/nano forming. High energies of the physical (electrical, ultrasonic, magnetic, thermal, etc.) fields directly/indirectly act on material aggregation, transfer, absorption, and conversion in multiscale structures, producing multiscale 3D metallic structures of high quality with great application potential in microelectronics, aerospace, automotive, and medical engineering.

         <title>Multiscale Architecture and Superior High&#8208;Temperature Performance of Discontinuously Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs), by tailoring multiscale architectures, have exposed more promising mechanical properties, including comparatively better strengthening effects, exceptional high&#8208;temperature endurability, and, most importantly, decent tensile ductility. The most recent developments, including the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for composites, are reviewed.








Abstract
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs), as one of the most important metal matrix composites (MMCs), are expected to exhibit high strength, elastic modulus, high&#8208;temperature endurability, wear resistance, isotropic property, and formability. Recent innovative research shows that tailoring the reinforcement network distribution totally differently from the conventional homogeneous distribution can not only improve the strengthening effect but also resolve the dilemma of DRTMCs with poor tensile ductility. Based on the network architecture, multiscale architecture, for example, two&#8208;scale network and laminate&#8208;network microstructure can further inspire superior strength, creep, and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Herein, the most recent developments, which include the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for DRTMCs with multiscale architecture, are captured. In this regard, the service temperature can be increased by 200 &#176;C, and the creep rupture time by 59&#8208;fold compared with those of conventional titanium alloys, which can meet the urgent demands of lightweight nickel&#8208;based structural materials and potentially replace nickel base superalloys at 600&#8211;800 &#176;C to reduce weight by 45%. In fact, multiscale architecture design strategy will also favorably open a new era in the research of extensive metallic materials for improved performances.

         <title>Lithium/Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries using Sulfide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are considered to be next&#8208;generation devices for electrochemical energy storages due to their superiority in high safety and energy density. Sulfide electrolytes have become one of the most promising ion conductors due to their high ionic conductivities. At the same time, the favorable interface compatibility of sulfide electrolytes with sulfide&#8208;based cathodes delivers bright prospect of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are considered as the next generation electrochemical energy storage devices because of their high safety and energy density, simple packaging, and wide operable temperature range. The critical component in ASSLBs is the solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Among all solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the sulfide electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivity and favorable interface compatibility with sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. The ionic conductivity of sulfide electrolytes is comparable with or even higher than that of the commercial organic liquid electrolytes. However, several critical challenges for sulfide electrolytes still remain to be solved, including their narrow electrochemical stability window, the unstable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes, as well as lithium dendrite formation in the electrolytes. Herein, the emerging sulfide electrolytes and preparation methods are reviewed. In particular, the required properties of the sulfide electrolytes, such as the electrochemical stabilities of the electrolytes and the compatible electrode/electrolyte interfaces are highlighted. The opportunities for sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs are also discussed.

         <title>Versatile Phospholipid Assemblies for Functional Synthetic Cells and Artificial Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phospholipids, with a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, are amphiphilic compounds capable of assembling into versatile membranous assemblies for the study of synthetic cells and artificial tissues. Current synthetic cell studies realize partial cell characteristics. It is imperative to increase hierarchical complexity of synthetic cells for a minimal cell with full life features.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of a synthetic cell from nonliving building blocks capable of mimicking cellular properties and behaviors helps to understand the particular biophysical properties and working mechanisms of a cell. A synthetic cell built in this way possesses defined chemical composition and structure. Since phospholipids are native biomembrane components, their assemblies are widely used to mimic cellular structures. Here, recent developments in the formation of versatile phospholipid assemblies are described, together with the applications of these assemblies for functional membranes (protein reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles), spherical and nonspherical protoorganelles, and functional synthetic cells, as well as the high&#8208;order hierarchical structures of artificial tissues. Their biomedical applications are also briefly summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in the field of synthetic cells and artificial tissues based on phospholipid assemblies are proposed.

         <title>Superwetting Shape Memory Microstructure: Smart Wetting Control and Practical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. Research results demonstrate that the shape memory ability of a shape memory polymer can provide excellent controllability in surface microstructure and wetting performance; meanwhile, some new functions can also be realized.








Abstract
Smart control of wettability on superwetting surfaces has aroused much attention in the past few years. Compared with traditional strategies such as adjusting the surface chemistry, regulating the surface microstructure is more difficult, though it can bring lots of new functions. Recently, it was found that, based on the shape memory effect of a shape memory polymer, the surface microstructure can be controlled more easily and precisely. Here, recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. The primary concern is the superhydrophobic surfaces that have demonstrated numerous attractive functions, including controllable droplet storage, transportation, bouncing, capture/release, and reprogrammable gradient wetting, under variation of the surface microstructure. Finally, some achievements in wetting control on other superwetting surfaces (such as superomniphobic surfaces and superslippery surfaces) and perspectives on future research directions are also discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical Intercalation in Atomically Thin van der Waals Materials for Structural Phase Transition and Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on the electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures via versatile electrochemical platforms and their influence on the structural phase transition of materials and novel device applications is reviewed, and the future opportunities especially on the intercalation via solid ion&#8208;conductor field&#8208;effect transistors are discussed.








Abstract

         <title>A Review on Micro/Nanoforming to Fabricate 3D Metallic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic review on micro&#8208;/nanoforming processes for the fabrication of 3D metallic structures with multifunctional properties is presented. The latest advances in achieving such microbulk forming, microsheet forming, energy&#8208;field microforming processes, 3D nanoprinting, and nanoforming with remarkably innovative methods are described.








Abstract
With the rapid development of micro&#8208;electromechanical systems (MEMS), micro/nanoscale fabrication of 3D metallic structures with complex structures and multifunctions is becoming more and more important due to the recent trend of product miniaturization. As a promising micromanufacturing approach based on plastic deformation, micro/nanoforming shows the attractive advantages of high productivity, low cost, near&#8208;net&#8208;shape, and excellent mechanical properties, compared with other non&#8208;silicon&#8208;based micromanufacturing technologies. However, micro/nanoforming is far less established due to the so&#8208;called size effects in terms of materials models, process laws, tooling design, etc. The understanding of basic issues on micro/nanoforming is not yet mature, and it is currently a topic of rigorous investigation. Here, a systematic review on the micro/nanoforming processes of 3D structures with multifunctional properties is presented, wherein also a critical examination of the interplay between relevant length scales and size effects affecting the structural integrity of micro/mesoscale metallic systems is also provided. Finally, the challenges of micro/nanoscale fabrication are proposed, including the development trends of new micro/nanoforming processes, multiple field coupling effects, and theoretical modeling at the trans&#8208;scale.

         <title>Applications of Nanomaterials in Asymmetric Photocatalysis: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>

Heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis well meets the strict demands of the modern chemistry industry and has attracted great interest in recent decades. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in asymmetric photocatalysis by heterogeneous nanomaterials is reviewed. The discussion comprises two sections based on the type of nanomaterials: inorganic semiconductors and porous materials. Finally, challenges and future developments of heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis are proposed.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is one of the most attractive strategies to obtain important enantiomerically pure chemicals with high quality and production. In addition, thanks to the abundant and sustainable advantages of solar energy, photocatalysis possesses great potential in environmentally benign reactions. Undoubtedly, asymmetric photocatalysis meets the strict demand of modern chemistry: environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;sustainable alternatives. Compared with homogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis has features of easy separation, recovery, and reuse merits, thus being cost&#8208; and time&#8208;effective. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in asymmetric photocatalysis by heterogeneous nanomaterials is addressed. The discussion comprises two sections based on the type of nanomaterials: typical inorganic semiconductors like TiO2 and quantum dots and emerging porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and organic cages. Finally, the challenges and future developments of heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis are proposed.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoparticles for Biophotonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles are emerging as a new class of optical probes for biological applications. A set of strategies to overcome the fundamental limits for enhanced luminescence brightness is presented, and their cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications ranging from high spatiotemporal optical imaging to highly sensitive in vivo biosensing, and to light&#8208;mediated synergistic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Light in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is increasingly utilized in bioapplications, providing deeper penetration in biological tissues owing to the lower absorption and scattering in comparison with light in the visible range. Lanthanide&#8208;doped luminescent nanoparticles with excitation and/or emission in the NIR range have recently attracted tremendous attention as one of the prime candidates for noninvasive biological applications due to their unique optical properties, such as large Stokes shift, spectrally sharp luminescence emissions, long luminescence lifetimes, and excellent photostability. Herein, recent advances of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles with NIR upconversion or downshifting luminescence and their uses in cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications are presented. A set of efficient strategies for overcoming the fundamental limit of low luminescence brightness of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is introduced. An in&#8208;depth literature review of their state&#8208;of&#8208;art biophotonics applications is also included, showing their superiority for high&#8208;resolution imaging, single&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;level detection, and efficacy for tissue&#8208;penetrating diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Nanomaterials Facilitating Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs) harnessing the microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) process have attracted worldwide interest. Recent advances in nanomaterials facilitating EET at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode and the biotic interface are summarized. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on BESs performance are described, which will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and better understanding of EET mechanisms.








Abstract
Electrochemically active bacteria can transport their metabolically generated electrons to anodes, or accept electrons from cathodes to synthesize high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, via a process known as extracellular electron transfer (EET). Harnessing of this microbial EET process has led to the development of microbial bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs), which can achieve the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy and enable electricity generation, hydrogen production, electrosynthesis, wastewater treatment, desalination, water and soil remediation, and sensing. Here, the focus is on the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode interface and the biotic interface, as well as some attempts to improve the EET by using various nanomaterials. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on the performance of BESs are described. The inherent mechanisms will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and lead to a better understanding of EET mechanisms.

Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is an emerging star of 2D materials. It is taken as an optimal substrate for other 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices owing to its atomical flatness, absence of dangling bonds, and excellent stability. Specifically, h&#8208;BN is found to be a natural hyperbolic material in the mid&#8208;infrared range, as well as a piezoelectric material. All the unique properties are beneficial for novel applications in optoelectronics and electronics. Currently, most of these applications are merely based on exfoliated h&#8208;BN flakes at their proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stages. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is considered as the most promising approach for producing large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, atomically thin h&#8208;BN films and heterostructures. Herein, CVD synthesis of atomically thin h&#8208;BN is the focus. Also, the growth kinetics are systematically investigated to point out general strategies for controllable and scalable preparation of single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film. Meanwhile, epitaxial growth of 2D materials onto h&#8208;BN and at its edge to construct heterostructures is summarized, emphasizing that the specific orientation of constituent parts in heterostructures can introduce novel properties. Finally, recent applications of atomically thin h&#8208;BN and its heterostructures in optoelectronics and electronics are summarized.

         <title>A Review of Shape Memory Polymers and Composites: Mechanisms, Materials, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape memory polymers are promising stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have provoked the interest of scientists over the past several decades. Progress in the mechanisms and applications of shape memory polymers is summarized, with a focus on the design and regulation of the shape memory effect. Future prospects and challenges in this exciting field are also proposed.








Abstract
Over the past decades, interest in shape memory polymers (SMPs) has persisted, and immense efforts have been dedicated to developing SMPs and their multifunctional composites. As a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, SMPs can return to their initial shape from a programmed temporary shape under external stimuli, such as light, heat, magnetism, and electricity. The introduction of functional materials and nanostructures results in shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) with large recoverable deformation, enhanced mechanical properties, and controllable remote actuation. Because of these unique features, SMPCs have a broad application prospect in many fields covering aerospace engineering, biomedical devices, flexible electronics, soft robotics, shape memory arrays, and 4D printing. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the shape recovery mechanisms, multifunctionality, applications, and recent advances in SMPs and SMPCs is presented. Specifically, the combination of functional, reversible, multiple, and controllable shape recovery processes is discussed. Further, established products from such materials are highlighted. Finally, potential directions for the future advancement of SMPs are proposed.

         <title>Recent Progress in Graphene/Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is reviewed, with emphasis on strengthening and toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal conversion. The roles of graphene configuration, interfacial interaction, and distribution of graphene in the polymer to determine the properties of the nanocomposites are systematically explored. This may provide constructive guidance to develop high&#8208;performance nanocomposites in the future.








Abstract
Nanocomposites, multiphase solid materials with at least one nanoscaled component, have been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention because of their unique properties. Graphene is an ideal filler for high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposites in light of its superior mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. However, the 2D nature of graphene usually gives rise to highly anisotropic features, which brings new opportunities to tailor nanocomposites by making full use of its excellent in&#8208;plane properties. Here, recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is summarized with emphasis on strengthening/toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal energy conversion. The influence of the graphene configuration, including layer number, defects, and lateral size, on its intrinsic properties and the properties of graphene/polymer nanocomposites is systematically analyzed. Meanwhile, the role of the interfacial interaction between graphene and polymer in affecting the properties of nanocomposites is also explored. The correlation between the graphene distribution in the matrix and the properties of the nanocomposite is discussed in detail. The key challenges and possible solutions are also addressed. This review may provide a constructive guidance for preparing high&#8208;performance graphene/polymer nanocomposite in the future.

         <title>Stretchable Electronics Based on PDMS Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic substrates, especially poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates, are indispensable components for emerging stretchable electronics. Detailed design concepts and fabrication strategies for structured, patterned, and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates, and their contributions in enhancing the mechanical performance of stretchable electronics are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges in the development of stretchable and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates are highlighted.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics, which can retain their functions under stretching, have attracted great interest in recent decades. Elastic substrates, which bear the applied strain and regulate the strain distribution in circuits, are indispensable components in stretchable electronics. Moreover, the self&#8208;healing property of the substrate is a premise to endow stretchable electronics with the same characteristics, so the device may recover from failure resulting from large and frequent deformations. Therefore, the properties of the elastic substrate are crucial to the overall performance of stretchable devices. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used as the substrate material for stretchable electronics, not only because of its advantages, which include stable chemical properties, good thermal stability, transparency, and biological compatibility, but also because of its capability of attaining designer functionalities via surface modification and bulk property tailoring. Herein, the strategies for fabricating stretchable electronics on PDMS substrates are summarized, and the influence of the physical and chemical properties of PDMS, including surface chemical status, physical modulus, geometric structures, and self&#8208;healing properties, on the performance of stretchable electronics is discussed. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of stretchable electronics based on PDMS substrates are considered.

         <title>Recent Progress on Topological Structures in Ferroic Thin Films and Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The timely advance and breakthrough of topological structures (domain walls, flux&#8208;closure domains, vortices, skyrmions, etc.) in ferroic (i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic) thin films and heterostructures over the past decade is demonstrated. The emergent properties and their multifield manipulations of these topological spin/polar structures hold great promise for future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectric and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological spin/polarization structures in ferroic materials continue to draw great attention as a result of their fascinating physical behaviors and promising applications in the field of high&#8208;density nonvolatile memories as well as future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Such developments have been made, in part, based on recent advances in theoretical calculations, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, and the characterization of their emergent phenomena and exotic phases. Herein, progress over the last decade in the study of topological structures in ferroic thin films and heterostructures is explored, including the observation of topological structures and control of their structures and emergent physical phenomena through epitaxial strain, layer thickness, electric, magnetic fields, etc. First, the evolution of topological spin structures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions) and associated functionalities (e.g., topological Hall effect) in magnetic thin films and heterostructures is discussed. Then, the exotic polar topologies (e.g., domain walls, closure domains, polar vortices, bubble domains, and polar skyrmions) and their emergent physical properties in ferroelectric oxide films and heterostructures are explored. Finally, a brief overview and prospectus of how the field may evolve in the coming years is provided.

Recent progress of MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging technologies are summarized. The challenges and perspectives for developing biomedical MNMs are presented.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro&#8208; and nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great potential for applications in the biomedical field, such as active targeted delivery, detoxification, minimally invasive diagnostics, and nanosurgery, owing to their tiny size, autonomous motion, and navigation capacities. To enter the clinic, biomedical MNMs request the biodegradability of their manufacturing materials, the biocompatibility of chemical fuels or externally physical fields, the capability of overcoming various biological barriers (e.g., biofouling, blood flow, blood&#8211;brain barrier, cell membrane), and the in vivo visual positioning for autonomous navigation. Herein, the recent advances of synthetic MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging techniques are highlighted. The challenges and future research priorities are also addressed. With continued attention and innovation, it is believed that, in the future, biomedical MNMs will pave the way to improve the targeted drug delivery efficiency.

The recent advances in applying the surface plasmon resonance effect from plasmonic nanostructures for enhanced photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are comprehensively summarized, highlighting the synthesis strategies of plasmonic nanomaterials along with future directions of plasmon&#8208;related research.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanomaterials coupled with catalytically active surfaces can provide unique opportunities for various catalysis applications, where surface plasmons produced upon proper light excitation can be adopted to drive and/or facilitate various chemical reactions. A brief introduction to the localized surface plasmon resonance and recent design and fabrication of highly efficient plasmonic nanostructures, including plasmonic metal nanostructures and metal/semiconductor heterostructures is given. Taking advantage of these plasmonic nanostructures, the following highlights summarize recent advances in plasmon&#8208;driven photochemical reactions (coupling reactions, O2 dissociation and oxidation reactions, H2 dissociation and hydrogenation reactions, N2 fixation and NH3 decomposition, and CO2 reduction) and plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, and CO2 reduction). Theoretical and experimental approaches for understanding the underlying mechanism of surface plasmon are discussed. A proper discussion and perspective of the remaining challenges and future opportunities for plasmonic nanomaterials and plasmon&#8208;related chemistry in the field of energy conversion and storage is given in conclusion.

         <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics between solid electrolytes and electrodes are considered as a crucial factor in determining all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery performance. The interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries, are discussed. Specifc attention is paid to interface physics and interface chemistry, as well as the strategies to address the above concerns.








Abstract
Owing to the promise of high safety and energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are attracting incremental interest as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread applications are inhibited by many technical challenges, including low&#8208;conductivity electrolytes, dendrite growth, and poor cycle/rate properties. Particularly, the interfacial dynamics between the solid electrolyte and the electrode is considered as a crucial factor in determining solid&#8208;state battery performance. In recent years, intensive research efforts have been devoted to understanding the interfacial behavior and strategies to overcome these challenges for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Here, the interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries (lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;air, etc.), are discussed. Specific attention is paid to interface physics (contact and wettability) and interface chemistry (passivation layer, ionic transport, dendrite growth), as well as the strategies to address the above concerns. The purpose here is to outline the current interface issues and challenges, allowing for target&#8208;oriented research for solid&#8208;state electrochemical energy storage. Current trends and future perspectives in interfacial engineering are also presented.

         <title>Advanced Electrocatalysis for Energy and Environmental Sustainability via Water and Nitrogen Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis associated with sustainable water (oxygen evolution and reduction reactions) and nitrogen (nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation reactions) cycles for energy conversion applications, which is important but challenging, is highlighted. Advanced catalysts, along with optimal electrolytes and electrode fabrication, are crucial for these corresponding clean energy technologies, including water proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, hydrogen fuel cells, ammonia electrosynthesis, and direct ammonia fuel cells.








Abstract
Clean and efficient energy storage and conversion via sustainable water and nitrogen reactions have attracted substantial attention to address the energy and environmental issues due to the overwhelming use of fossil fuels. These electrochemical reactions are crucial for desirable clean energy technologies, including advanced water electrolyzers, hydrogen fuel cells, and ammonia electrosynthesis and utilization. Their sluggish reaction kinetics lead to inefficient energy conversion. Innovative electrocatalysis, i.e., catalysis at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte to facilitate charge transfer and mass transport, plays a vital role in boosting energy conversion efficiency and providing sufficient performance and durability for these energy technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review on recent progress, achievements, and remaining challenges for these electrocatalysis processes related to water (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER, and oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and nitrogen (i.e., nitrogen reduction reaction, NRR, for ammonia synthesis and ammonia oxidation reaction, AOR, for energy utilization) is provided. Catalysts, electrolytes, and interfaces between the two within electrodes for these electrocatalysis processes are discussed. The primary emphasis is device performance of OER&#8208;related proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, ORR&#8208;related PEM fuel cells, NRR&#8208;driven ammonia electrosynthesis from water and nitrogen, and AOR&#8208;related direct ammonia fuel cells.

         <title>Bioinspired Microstructured Materials for Optical and Thermal Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise optical and thermal regulatory systems are found in nature, specifically in the microstructures on organisms&#8217; surfaces. The comprehensive control performance of light and heat integrated by these bioinspired microstructures is introduced and a solution strategy for the development of low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, intelligent thermal control instruments is provided.








Abstract
Precise optical and thermal regulatory systems are found in nature, specifically in the microstructures on organisms&#8217; surfaces. In fact, the interaction between light and matter through these microstructures is of great significance to the evolution and survival of organisms. Furthermore, the optical regulation by these biological microstructures is engineered owing to natural selection. Herein, the role that microstructures play in enhancing optical performance or creating new optical properties in nature is summarized, with a focus on the regulation mechanisms of the solar and infrared spectra emanating from the microstructures and their role in the field of thermal radiation. The causes of the unique optical phenomena are discussed, focusing on prevailing characteristics such as high absorption, high transmission, adjustable reflection, adjustable absorption, and dynamic infrared radiative design. On this basis, the comprehensive control performance of light and heat integrated by this bioinspired microstructure is introduced in detail and a solution strategy for the development of low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, intelligent thermal control instruments is discussed. In order to develop such an instrument, a microstructural design foundation is provided.

The recent progress on reaction mechanism, kinetics, and degradation of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, especially metal oxides and chalcogenides, is systematically reviewed; the challenges and prospects are also discussed.








Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type materials have been considered as potentially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to commercially dominant intercalation&#8208;based electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries and have attracted tremendous research effort to meet the performance for viable energy&#8208;storage technologies. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been extensively employed to provide mechanistic insights into understanding the behavior of battery materials. Noticeably, a great portion of previous in situ TEM studies has been focused on conversion&#8208;type materials, but a dedicated review for this group of materials is missing in the literature. Herein, recent developments of in situ TEM techniques for investigation of dynamic phase transformation and associated structural, morphological, and chemical evolutions during conversion reactions with alkali ions in secondary batteries are comprehensively summarized. The materials of interest broadly cover metal oxides, chalcogenides, fluorides, phosphides, nitrides, and silicates with specific emphasis on spinel metal oxides and recently emerged 2D metal chalcogenides. Special focus is placed on the scientific findings that are uniquely obtained by in situ TEM to address fundamental questions and practical issues regarding phase transformation, structural evolution, electrochemical redox, reaction mechanism, kinetics, and degradation. Critical challenges and perspectives are discussed for advancing new knowledge that can bridge the gap between prototype materials and real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanostructured Lead Halide Perovskites: From Materials to Integrations and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices. Patterning and integration techniques for nanostructured perovskites are summarized and recent progress in novel nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications is presented.








Abstract
In the past decade, lead halide perovskites have been intensively explored due to their promising future in photovoltaics. Owing to their remarkable material properties such as solution processability, nice defect tolerance, broad bandgap tunability, high quantum yields, large refractive index, and strong nonlinear effects, this family of materials has also shown advantages in many other optoelectronic devices including microlasers, photodetectors, waveguides, and metasurfaces. Very recently, the stability of perovskite devices has been improved with the optimization of synthesis methods and device architectures. It is widely accepted that it is the time to integrate all the perovskite devices into a real system. However, for integrated photonic circuits, the shapes and distributions of chemically synthesized perovskites are quite random and not suitable for integration. Consequently, controlled synthesis and the top&#8208;down fabrication process are highly desirable to break the barriers. Herein, the developments of patterning and integration techniques for halide perovskites, as well as the structure/function relationships, are systematically reviewed. The recent progress in the study of optical responses originating from nanostructured perovskites is also presented. Lastly, the challenges and perspective for nanostructured&#8208;perovskite devices are discussed.

         <title>Low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;Free Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Stability Challenges and Material Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (PGM) and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are emerging as two important technologies for developing proton exchange membrane fuel cells, which, however, suffer severe degradation in real&#8208;world operation. The degradation mechanisms of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are reviewed and materials&#8208;based solutions are discussed in order to bridge the knowledge gap between material innovation and device integration.








Abstract
Fuel cells as an attractive clean energy technology have recently regained popularity in academia, government, and industry. In a mainstream proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (PGM)&#8208;based catalysts account for &#8776;50% of the projected total cost for large&#8208;scale production. To lower the cost, two materials&#8208;based strategies have been pursued: 1) to decrease PGM catalyst usage (so&#8208;called low&#8208;PGM catalysts), and 2) to develop alternative PGM&#8208;free catalysts. Grand stability challenges exist when PGM catalyst loading is decreased in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA)&#8212;the power generation unit of a PEM fuel cell&#8212;or when PGM&#8208;free catalysts are integrated into an MEA. More importantly, there is a significant knowledge gap between materials innovation and device integration. For example, high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts usually demonstrate undesired quick degradation in MEAs. This issue significantly limits the development of PEM fuel cells. Herein, recent progress in understanding the degradation of low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cell MEAs and materials&#8208;based solutions to address these issues are reviewed. The key factors that degrade the MEA performance are highlighted. Innovative, emerging material concepts and development of low&#8208;PGM and PGM&#8208;free catalysts are discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Design, Modulation, and Challenges in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be promising candidates over noble metal catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production. The basic mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is introduced, followed by a description of the different synthesis methods and modulation approaches to enhance the catalytic performance of TMD&#8208;based catalysts toward the HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen has been deemed as an ideal substitute fuel to fossil energy because of its renewability and the highest energy density among all chemical fuels. One of the most economical, ecofriendly, and high&#8208;performance ways of hydrogen production is electrochemical water splitting. Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (also known as 2D TMDs) showed their utilization potentiality as cost&#8208;effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts in water electrolysis. Herein, recent representative research efforts and systematic progress made in 2D TMDs are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are discussed. Furthermore, general methods of synthesizing 2D TMDs materials are introduced in detail and the advantages and disadvantages for some specific methods are provided. This explanation includes several important regulation strategies of creating more active sites, heteroatoms doping, phase engineering, construction of heterostructures, and synergistic modulation which are capable of optimizing the electrical conductivity, exposure to the catalytic active sites, and reaction energy barrier of the electrode material to boost the HER kinetics. In the last section, the current obstacles and future chances for the development of 2D TMDs electrocatalysts are proposed to provide insight into and valuable guidelines for fabricating effective HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tailoring of Typical Color Centers in Diamond for Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 6, February 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Its unique electronic structure and excellent spin coherence attract the interest of many researchers to the nitrogen&#8208;vacancy color center. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to solve before fully exerting its characteristic performance. The research progress in these issues is summarized and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends.








Abstract
On the demand of single&#8208;photon entangled light sources and high&#8208;sensitivity probes in the fields of quantum information processing, weak magnetic field detection and biosensing, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center is very attractive and has been deeply and intensively studied, due to its convenience of spin initialization, operation, and optical readout combined with long coherence time in the ambient environment. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to be solved before fully exerting its characteristic performance, including enhancement of emission of NV centers in certain charge state (NV&#8722; or NV0), obtaining indistinguishable photons, and improving of collecting efficiency for the photons. Herein, the research progress in these issues is reviewed and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends. In addition, the development of emerging color centers, such as germanium vacancy defects, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, with great potential for various applications, are also briefly surveyed.

         <title>Kirigami Engineering&#8212;Nanoscale Structures Exhibiting a Range of Controllable 3D Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the thickness of a single nanoscale 3D kirigami structure with two distinct out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tilting configurations is studied. The findings represent a new step in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a new degree of freedom to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures.








Abstract
Kirigami structures provide a promising approach to transform flat films into 3D complex structures that are difficult to achieve by conventional fabrication approaches. By designing the cutting geometry, it is shown that distinct buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations can be obtained, separated by a sharp transition characterized by a critical geometric dimension of the structures. In situ electron microscopy experiments reveal the effect of the ratio between the in&#8208;plane cut size and film thickness on out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations. Moreover, geometrically nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) accurately predict the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane modes measured experimentally, their transition as a function of cut geometry, and provide the stress&#8211;strain response of the kirigami structures. The combined computational&#8211;experimental approach and results reported here represent a step forward in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a path to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations promise great utility in the creation of micro&#8208; and nanoscale systems that can harness such structural behavior, such as optical scanning micromirrors, novel actuators, and nanorobotics. This work is of particular significance as the kirigami dimensions approach the sub&#8208;micrometer scale which is challenging to achieve with conventional micro&#8208;electromechanical system technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Surface Drag Coating: A New Route Toward High&#8208;Quality Conjugated Small&#8208;Molecule Thin Films with Enhanced Charge Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;surface drag coating method is developed for large&#8208;area fabrication of high&#8208;quality conjugated small&#8208;molecule thin films with enhanced charge transport properties. 2,8&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are realized, showing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility compared to that of thin films fabricated by the conventional solution&#8208;coating method.








Abstract
Electronic properties of organic semiconductor (OSC) thin films are largely determined by their morphologies and crystallinities. However, solution&#8208;processed conjugated small&#8208;molecule OSC thin films usually exhibit abundant grain boundaries and impure grain orientations because of complex fluid dynamics during solution coating. Here, a novel methodology, water&#8208;surface drag coating, is demonstrated to fabricate high&#8208;quality OSC thin films with greatly enhanced charge transport properties. This method utilizes the water surface to alter the evaporation dynamics of solution to enlarge the grain size, and a unique drag&#8208;coating process to achieve the unidirectional growth of organic crystals. Using 2,8&#8208;difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) as an example, thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are achieved, revealing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility. More importantly, the resulting film can be directly transferred onto any desired flexible substrates, and flexible transistors based on the Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT thin films show a mobility as high as 16.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which represents the highest mobility value for the flexible transistors reported thus far. The method is general for the growth of various high&#8208;quality OSC thin films, thus opening up opportunities for high&#8208;performance organic flexible electronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Stress Relaxation, Toughness Improvement, and Photoinduced Reversal of Physical Aging in Glassy Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) moieties are introduced into glassy copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) networks to promote spatiotemporally controlled dynamic bond exchange in the glassy state. As a result, unprecedented levels of stress relaxation, extended plastic deformation post yielding, and intriguing rejuvenation of mechanical properties in physically aged samples are achieved by activation of RAFT in the glassy state.








Abstract
A covalent adaptable network (CAN) with high glass transition temperature (Tg), superior mechanical properties including toughness and ductility, and unprecedented spatio&#8208;temporally controlled dynamic behavior is prepared by introducing dynamic moieties capable of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) into photoinitiated copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)&#8208;based networks. While the CuAAC polymerization yields glassy polymers composed of rigid triazole linkages with enhanced toughness, the RAFT moieties undergo bond exchange leading to stress relaxation upon light exposure. This unprecedented level of stress relaxation in the glassy state leads to numerous desirable attributes including glassy state photoinduced plasticity, toughness improvement during large deformation, and even photoinduced reversal of the effects of physical aging resulting in the rejuvenation of mechanical and thermodynamic properties in physically aged RAFT&#8208;CuAAC networks that undergo bond exchange in the glassy state. Surprisingly, when an allyl&#8208;sulfide&#8208;containing azide monomer (AS&#8208;N3) is used to form the network, the network exhibits up to 80% stress relaxation in the glassy state (Tg&#160;&#8722; 45 &#176;C) under fixed displacement. In situ activation of RAFT during mechanical loading results in a 50% improvement in elongation to break and 40% improvement in the toughness when compared to the same network without light&#8208;activation of RAFT during the tensile testing.

         <title>Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering of Red Phosphorous&#8211;Metal for Eradicating MRSA Infection Effectively</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable sonothermal ability can be realized through interfacial engineering by constructing heterojunction interfaces between red phosphorous and metals (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni). Ultrasound&#8208;excited electrons convert ultrasonic energy into heat through vibration, relaxation, and recombination in the heterointerface. Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be eradicated efficiently by sonothermal effect and with thermally controlled release of nitric oxide gas.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered to be a potential treatment for various diseases including cancers and bacterial infections due to its deep penetration ability and biosafety, but its SDT efficiency is limited by the hypoxia environment of deep tissues. This study proposes creating a potential solution, sonothermal therapy, by developing the ultrasonic interfacial engineering of metal&#8211;red phosphorus (RP), which has an obviously improved sonothermal ability of more than 20 &#176;C elevation under 25 min of continuous ultrasound (US) excitation as compared to metal alone. The underlying mechanism is that the mechanical energy of the US activates the motion of the interfacial electrons. US&#8208;induced electron motion in the RP can efficiently transfer the US energy into phonons in the forms of heat and lattice vibrations, resulting in a stronger US absorption of metal&#8211;RP. Unlike the nonspecific heating of the cavitation effect induced by US, titanium&#8211;RP can be heated in situ when the US penetrates through 2.5&#160;cm of pork tissue. In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.

The combined advantages of redox flow batteries and static batteries are demonstrated for enhanced thermoelectric energy conversion and decoupled high&#8208;energy&#8208;density large&#8208;scale electricity storage.








Abstract
A large amount of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is produced in electrical devices and mostly wasted. This type of heat without effective dissipation also causes compromised device performance, reliability, and lifespan. To tackle these issues, a redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based flow cell with judiciously designed thermoelectrically active redox materials is demonstrated for the first time for efficient heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion through a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC). Compared with the conventional TREC systems, the RT&#8208;based flow cell not only reveals considerably enhanced thermoelectric efficiency, but the flow of redox fluids also provides a cooling function to the system. In this work, solid material Ni0.2Co0.8(OH)2 and redox mediator [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, both of which have negative temperature coefficient and share identical redox potential, are paired via RT&#8208;reactions to boost the capacity and meanwhile thermoelectric efficiency of a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;/Zn0/2+&#8208;based flow cell. Upon operating over the TREC cycle, the RT&#8208;based flow cell converts heat to electricity at an unprecedented absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 3.61% in the temperature range of 25&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Magnetoelectric Tuning of Pinning&#8208;Type Permanent Magnets through Atomic&#8208;Scale Engineering of Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through injection of hydrogen atoms into grain boundaries, the coercivity of a Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnet is tuned by &#8776;1.3 T by applying &#8776;1 V. This work not only offers an effective route to achieve giant magnetoelectric effects in metallic ferromagnets, but also unveils the neglected critical role of grain boundaries in determining the coercivity of pinning&#8208;type magnets.








Abstract
Pinning&#8208;type magnets with high coercivity at high temperatures are at the core of thriving clean&#8208;energy technologies. Among these, Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnets are excellent candidates owing to their high&#8208;temperature stability. However, despite intensive efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20&#8211;30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain&#8208;interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magnetoelectric approach. Through hydrogen charging/discharging by applying voltages of only &#8776;1&#160;V, the coercivity is reversibly tuned by an unprecedented value of &#8776;1.3 T. In situ magneto&#8208;structural characterization and atomic&#8208;scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen reduces the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries. This study opens a way to achieve the giant magnetoelectric effect in permanent magnets by engineering grain boundaries with hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, it reveals the so far neglected critical role of grain boundaries in the conventional magnetization&#8208;switching paradigm of pinning&#8208;type magnets, suggesting a critical reconsideration of engineering strategies to overcome the coercivity limits.

         <title>Tunable Photocontrolled Motions of Anil&#8208;Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Systems through Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Trans&#8211;Cis Isomerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple photoresponsive motions, excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, and trans&#8211;cis isomerization, are combined into anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems to achieve photocontrolled function with the aid of a stretching process. The relationship between molecular structure and photodeformation property is investigated, to provide efficient strategies of molecular design for the further development of photoresponsive materials.








Abstract
With the combination of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and trans&#8211;cis isomerization as microscopic molecular motions under light stimulus, multiple photodeformable processes are achieved in anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems, including simple bending, dancing butterflies, and switches. The doping films can realize light&#8208;driven contraction as large as 70% and bending angle of about 141&#176;, upon a simple stretching process. The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.

         <title>Quantum Rescaling, Domain Metastability, and Hybrid Domain&#8208;Walls in 2D CrI3 Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in nanomagnets. However, it is unclear whether they are important in recently discovered 2D magnets. It is shown that biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling corrections are the keys to the long&#8208;range ordering of 2D CrI3 layers. Metastability induces domain walls of hybrid types with different chirality.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order exchange interactions and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in describing the properties of low&#8208;dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, the recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) CrI3 is identified as a quantum non&#8208;Heisenberg material with properties far beyond an Ising magnet as initially assumed. It is found that biquadratic exchange interactions are essential to quantitatively describe the magnetism of CrI3 but quantum rescaling corrections are required to reproduce its thermal properties. The quantum nature of the heat bath represented by discrete electron&#8211;spin and phonon&#8211;spin scattering processes induces the formation of spin fluctuations in the low&#8208;temperature regime. These fluctuations induce the formation of metastable magnetic domains evolving into a single macroscopic magnetization or even a monodomain over surface areas of a few micrometers. Such domains display hybrid characteristics of N&#233;el and Bloch types with a narrow domain wall width in the range of 3&#8211;5 nm. Similar behavior is expected for the majority of 2D vdW magnets where higher&#8208;order exchange interactions are appreciable.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery with Ion&#8208;Selective Nanofluidic Transport in a Conjugated Microporous Polymer Protective Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous polymers are developed as protective layers for lithium anodes to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a long cycle life. A pouch cell fabricated using CMP&#8208;modified lithium foil achieves an energy density exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cycle stability &gt;65 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of anodes, capable of unlocking the full potential of cathodes in next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the use of pure lithium anodes faces several challenges in terms of safety, cycle life, and rate capability. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous thermosetting polymer (CMP) is developed. The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes. Pouch cells with CMP&#8208;Li as the anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) as the cathode exhibits a stable energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1.

The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes. Pouch cells with CMP&#8208;Li as the anode and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) as the cathode exhibits a stable energy density of 400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Monochloro Copper Phthalocyanine Memristor with High&#8208;Temperature Resilience for Electronic Synapse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic memristor using small&#8208;molecule monochloro copper phthalocyanine as the active material is developed. The unencapsulated memristive devices exhibit high thermal resilience at 300 &#176;C, good flexibility, and high capability of simulating a variety of functions of biological synapses. This work offers an effective approach toward the implementation of brain&#8211;computer interface technology for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Memristors are considered to be one of the most promising device concepts for neuromorphic computing, in particular thanks to their highly tunable resistive states. To realize neuromorphic computing architectures, the assembly of large memristive crossbar arrays is necessary, but is often accompanied by severe heat dispassion. Organic materials can be tailored with on&#8208;demand electronic properties in the context of neuromorphic applications. However, such materials are more susceptible to heat, and detrimental effects such as thermally induced degradation directly lead to failure of device operation. Here, an organic memristive synapse formed of monochloro copper phthalocyanine, which remains operational and capable of memristive switching at temperatures as high as 300 &#176;C in ambient air without any encapsulation, is demonstrated. The change in the electrical conductance is found to be a result of ion movement, closely resembling what takes place in biological neurons. Furthermore, the high viability of this approach is showcased by demonstrating flexible memristors with stable switching behaviors after repeated mechanical bending as well as organic synapses capable of emulating a trainable and reconfigurable memristor array for image information processing. The results set a precedent for thermally resilient organic synapses to impact organic neuromorphic devices in progressing their practicality.

         <title>Tunnel Intergrowth LixMnO2 Nanosheet Arrays as 3D Cathode for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunnel intergrowth LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels are developed by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at a low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Benefiting from the stable tunnel structure for the cathode and favorable architecture with abundant 3D cathode/electrolyte interface, the constructed LixMnO2/LiPON/Li thin&#8208;film battery achieves large specific capacity and outstanding cycle life.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium batteries (TFBs) are proposed as the ideal power sources for microelectronic devices. However, the high&#8208;temperature (&gt;500 &#176;C) annealing process of cathode films, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, restricts the on&#8208;chip integration and potential applications of TFBs. Herein, tunnel structured LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays are fabricated as 3D cathode for TFBs by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at very low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Featuring an interesting tunnel intergrowth structure consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels, the LixMnO2 cathode shows high specific capacity with good structural stability between 2.0 and 4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li). By utilizing the 3D LixMnO2 cathode, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LixMnO2/LiPON/Li TFB (3DLMO&#8208;TFB) has been successfully constructed with prominent advantages of greatly enriched cathode/electrolyte interface and shortened Li+ diffusion length in the 3D structure. Consequently, the 3DLMO&#8208;TFB device exhibits large specific capacity (185 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), good rate performance, and excellent cycle performance (81.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming the TFBs using spinel LiMn2O4 thin film cathodes fabricated at high temperature. Importantly, the low&#8208;temperature preparation of high&#8208;performance cathode film enables the fabrication of TFBs on various rigid and flexible substrates, which could greatly expand their potential applications in microelectronics.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescent Transistors: A New Strategy toward Light&#8208;Emitting Switching Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemiluminescent (ECL)&#8208;principle&#8208;based approach to demonstrate high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) is introduced. Exploiting a solid electrolyte with an ECL luminophore (ECL Gel) as a gate insulator, p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar LETs are successfully realized. Not only light&#8208;emitting materials, but conventional semiconductors can be employed for high&#8208;mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission, providing new opportunities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) have attracted a significant amount of interest as multifunctional building blocks for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronic devices. However, it is challenging to obtain LETs with a high carrier mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission because the semiconductor channel should provide both the electrical charge transport and optical light&#8208;emission, and typical emissive semiconductors have low, imbalanced carrier mobilities. In this work, a novel device platform that adapts the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle in LETs, referred to as an ECL transistor (ECLT) is proposed. ECL is a light&#8208;emission phenomenon from electrochemically excited luminophores generated by redox reactions. A solid&#8208;state ECL electrolyte consisting of a network&#8208;forming polymer, ionic liquid, luminophore, and co&#8208;reactant is employed as the light&#8208;emitting gate insulator of the ECLT. Based on this construction, high&#8208;performance LETs that make use of various conventional non&#8208;emissive semiconductors (e.g., poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), zinc oxide, and reduced graphene oxide) are successfully demonstrated. All the devices exhibit a high mobility (0.9&#8211;10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a uniform light&#8208;emission. This innovative approach demonstrates a novel LET platform and provides a promising pathway to achieve significant breakthroughs to develop electronic circuits and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Selective Ethanol Oxidation Reaction at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO2, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface in SnO2&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO2&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mgRh&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&#63743;C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (*CO and *CH3) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.

&lt;p&gt;The Rh&#8211;SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface in SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mg&lt;sub&gt;Rh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anharmonicity&#8208;Driven Rashba Cohelical Excitons Break Quantum Efficiency Limitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emission mechanism of lead halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is revealed in which A&#8208;site cation disorder caused by unstable non&#8208;centrosymmetric vibrations plays a crucial role. The subsequent disorder of the A&#8208;site cation leads to Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and the lowest&#8208;lying bright cohelical exciton state. This allows for PeLEDs to overcome the internal 25% efficiency limitation of closed&#8208;shell LEDs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;shell light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A&#160;=&#160;Cs/CN2H5; X&#160;=&#160;Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed&#8208;shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J&#160;=&#160;0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital&#8208;bonding network along the imaginary A+&#8230;X&#8722;(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling (RD&#8208;SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many&#8208;body theory and first&#8208;principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD&#8208;SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25% IQE limitation for closed&#8208;shell LEDs.

         <title>Extremely Fast Optical and Nonvolatile Control of Mixed&#8208;Phase Multiferroic BiFeO3 via Instantaneous Strain Perturbation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;optical manipulation of the complex phases and domain structures in multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films on ultrafast timescale is demonstrated by adoption of extremely short light pulses. The configuration of large&#8208;area optically written domains can be controlled by tuning the competing elastic and electrostatic energies. These results offer a novel route for the development of all&#8208;optical switchable devices and high&#8208;speed multifunctional optoelectronics.








Abstract
Multiferroics&#8212;materials that exhibit coupled ferroic orders&#8212;are considered to be one of the most promising candidate material systems for next&#8208;generation spintronics, memory, low&#8208;power nanoelectronics and so on. To advance potential applications, approaches that lead to persistent and extremely fast functional property changes are in demand. Herein, it is revealed that the phase transition and the correlated ferroic orders in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) can be modulated via illumination of single short/ultrashort light pulses. Heat transport simulations and ultrafast optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveal that the transient strain induced by light pulses plays a key role in determining the persistent final states. Having identified the diffusionless phase transformation features via scanning transmission electron microscopy, sequential laser pulse illumination is further demonstrated to perform large&#8208;area phase and domain manipulation in a deterministic way. The work contributes to all&#8208;optical and rapid nonvolatile control of multiferroicity, offering different routes while designing novel optoelectronics.

         <title>Direct Magnetic Reinforcement of Electrocatalytic ORR/OER with Electromagnetic Induction of Magnetic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external magnetic field increases the probability of spin polarization of magnetic metal nanoparticles and thus can enhance their oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. In this work, carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts of magnetic catalytic nanocages are fabricated by uniformly embedding cobalt nanoparticles into macroporous carbon nanofibers. The direct magnetic enhancement is verified by investigating the electrocatalytic ORR/OER performance under an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Designing stable and efficient electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at low&#8208;cost is challenging. Here, a carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst of magnetic catalytic nanocages that can direct enhance the oxygen catalytic activity by simply applying a moderate (350 mT) magnetic field is reported. The catalysts, with high porosity of 90% and conductivity of 905 S m&#8722;1, are created by in situ doping metallic cobalt nanodots (&#8776;10&#160;nm) into macroporous carbon nanofibers with a facile electrospinning method. An external magnetic field makes the cobalt magnetized into nanomagnets with high spin polarization, which promote the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;intermediates and electron transfer, significantly improving the catalytic efficiency. Impressively, the half wave&#8208;potential is increased by 20&#160;mV for ORR, and the overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is decreased by 15&#160;mV for OER. Compared with the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts, the magnetic catalyzed Zn&#8211;air batteries deliver 2.5&#8208;fold of capacities and exhibit much longer durability over 155 h. The findings point out a very promising strategy of using electromagnetic induction to boost oxygen catalytic activity.

         <title>Mapping of Texture and Phase Fractions in Heterogeneous Stress States during Multiaxial Loading of Biomedical Superelastic NiTi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multi&#8208;axial loading and heating. The similarity in R&#8208;phase variant behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading, is discussed along with its ability to accommodate the resulting stress and strain mismatch.








Abstract
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multiaxial loading and heating. The trigonal R&#8208;phase is formed from the cubic phase during cooling to room temperature and subsequently deforms in compression, tension, and torsion. The resulting R&#8208;phase variant microstructure from the variant reorientation and detwinning processes are equivalent for the corresponding strain in tension and compression, and the variant microstructure is reversible by isothermal loading. The R&#8208;phase variant microstructure is consistent between uniaxial and torsional loading when the principal stress directions of the stress state are considered (for the crystallographic directions observed here). The variant microstructure evolution is tracked and the similarity in general behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the implicit heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading, pointed to the ability of the reversible thermoelastic transformation in NiTi to accommodate stress and strain mismatch with deformation. This ability of the R&#8208;phase, despite its limited variants, to accommodate stress and strain and satisfy strain incompatibility in addition to the existing internal stresses has significance for reducing irrecoverable deformation mechanisms during loading and cycling through the phase transformation.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled through Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile self&#8208;assembly strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), based on nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite design is proposed. The laminated nanoclay endows the films with tunable oxygen permeability, and programmable retention times of RTP signals can be achieved. Applications including oxygen sensors and photolithographic RTP tags, and a new anti&#8208;interception concept are demonstrated.








Abstract
A generic, facile, and waterborne strategy is introduced to fabricate flexible, low&#8208;cost nanocomposite films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) by incorporating waterborne RTP polymers into self&#8208;assembled bioinspired polymer/nanoclay nanocomposites. The excellent oxygen barrier of the lamellar nanoclay structure suppresses the quenching effect from ambient oxygen (kq) and broadens the choice of polymer matrices towards lower glass transition temperature (Tg), while providing better mechanical properties and processability. Moreover, the oxygen permeation and diffusion inside the films can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the polymer/nanoclay ratio, enabling programmable retention times of the RTP signals, which is exploited for transient information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Additionally, anti&#8208;interception materials are showcased by tracing the interception&#8208;induced oxygen history that interferes with the preset self&#8208;erasing time. Merging bioinspired nanocomposite design with RTP materials contributes to overcoming the inherent limitations of molecular design of organic RTP compounds, and allows programmable temporal features to be added into RTP materials by controlled mesostructures. This will assist in paving the way for practical applications of RTP materials as novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Finding the Next Superhard Material through Ensemble Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method capable of finding new superhard materials is constructed by directly predicting the experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. The model is then used to conduct high&#8208;throughput screening of crystal databases and machine&#8208;learning generated phase diagrams to suggest undiscovered superhard materials.








Abstract
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method is demonstrated to be capable of finding superhard materials by directly predicting the load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on the chemical composition. A total of 1062 experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness data are extracted from the literature and used to train a supervised machine&#8208;learning algorithm utilizing boosting, achieving excellent accuracy (R2&#160;= 0.97). This new model is then tested by synthesizing and measuring the load&#8208;dependent hardness of several unreported disilicides and analyzing the predicted hardness of several classic superhard materials. The trained ensemble method is then employed to screen for superhard materials by examining more than 66&#8201;000 compounds in crystal structure databases, which show that 68 known materials have a Vickers hardness &#8805;40 GPa at 0.5 N (applied force) and only 10 exceed this mark at 5 N. The hardness model is then combined with the data&#8208;driven phase diagram generation tool to expand the limited number of reported high hardness compounds. Eleven ternary borocarbide phase spaces are studied, and more than ten thermodynamically favorable compositions with a hardness above 40 GPa (at 0.5 N) are identified, proving this ensemble model's ability to find previously unknown materials with outstanding mechanical&#160;properties.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Single&#8208;Mode Lasing through Efficient Vapor&#8208;Assisted Chlorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue laser sources are of interest in lithography, microscopy, and medical and scientific devices; and lasers have, until now, been limited to bulky gas laser systems and III&#8211;V semiconductor devices. A new strategy to achieve deep&#8208;blue emitting perovskite films, and the prospect of extending the range of deep&#8208;blue/near&#8208;UV laser sources are reported.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for solution&#8208;processed laser gain materials, with impressive performance in the green and red spectral regions. Despite exciting progress, deep&#8208;blue&#8212;an important wavelength for laser applications&#8212;remains underexplored; indeed, cavity integration and single&#8208;mode lasing from large&#8208;bandgap perovskites have yet to be achieved. Here,&#160;a vapor&#8208;assisted chlorination strategy that enables synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional CsPbCl3&#160;thin films exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission is reported. Using this approach,&#160; high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films having a low surface roughness (RMS &#8776; 1.3&#160;nm) and efficient charge transfer properties are achieved. These enable us to document low&#8208;threshold amplified spontaneous emission. Levering the high quality of the gain medium,&#160; vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers with a low lasing threshold of 6.5 &#181;J cm&#8722;2&#160;are fabricated. This report of deep&#8208;blue perovskite single&#8208;mode lasing showcases the prospect of increasing the range of deep&#8208;blue laser sources.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005275, Horacio D. Espinosa,  Daniel Lopez, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the engineering of nanoscale kirigami structures exhibiting a range of buckling&#8208;induced controllable 3D configurations. By combining nanomanufacturing, in situ microscopy experimentation, and computational modeling, symmetric and asymmetric 3D configurations relevant to numerous applications are demonstrated, including kirigami&#8208;based soft nanogrippers (robotics), light modulation, deformable electronics, and tunable metamaterials.

In article number 2005112, Jakoah Brgoch and co&#8208;workers establish an ensemble machine&#8208;learning method to find new superhard materials. The model is trained on the sparse experimental data available in the literature to predict load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. Crystal&#8208;structure databases and unknown phase diagrams are then screened in search of novel materials with an outstanding mechanical response.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in the properties of nanomagnets. In article number 2004138, Elton J. G. Santos and co&#8208;workers show that recently discovered two&#8208;dimensional CrI3 magnets require biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling to describe their long&#8208;range ordering. Metastability of the magnetic domains induces domain walls with different chirality, which is important for the new generation of quantum&#8208;materials&#8208;based technologies.

In article number 2005456, Keun Hyung Lee, Kihyon Hong, and co&#8208;workers introduce a new concept of light&#8208;emitting transistors based on the principle of electrochemiluminescence. An ion&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;state ECL electrolyte is utilized in electrochemiluminescent transistors as a gate insulator for charge accumulation and light emission. Owing to the unique electrical and optical features of the electrochemiluminescent material, the devices exhibit not only excellent electrical properties, but also uniform light emission. This concept can be a new path toward advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Design of Local Atomic Environments in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Conversions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich variety of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates vast opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance renewable energy conversion.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have recently attracted tremendous research interest due to their often remarkable catalytic responses, unmatched by conventional catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.

         <title>Biomaterials and 3D Bioprinting Strategies to Model Glioblastoma and the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on 3D&#8208;bioprinted models of glioblastoma and the blood&#8211;brain barrier are reviewed. In order to inform future design and implementation of 3D modeling, cellular and extracellular matrix components of the native tissue microenvironments, relevant natural and synthetic biomaterials and various 3D bioprinting strategies, are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal adult primary central nervous system cancer. An immunosuppresive and highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, restricted delivery of chemotherapy or immunotherapy through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), together with the brain's unique biochemical and anatomical features result in its universal recurrence and poor prognosis. As conventional models fail to predict therapeutic efficacy in GBM, in vitro 3D models of GBM and BBB leveraging patient&#8208; or healthy&#8208;individual&#8208;derived cells and biomaterials through 3D bioprinting technologies potentially mimic essential physiological and pathological features of GBM and BBB. 3D&#8208;bioprinted constructs enable investigation of cellular and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions in a species&#8208;matched, high&#8208;throughput, and reproducible manner, serving as screening or drug delivery platforms. Here, an overview of current 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models is provided, elaborating on the microenvironmental compositions of GBM and BBB, relevant biomaterials to mimic the native tissues, and bioprinting strategies to implement the model fabrication. Collectively, 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models are promising systems and biomimetic alternatives to traditional models for more reliable mechanistic studies and preclinical drug screenings that may eventually accelerate the drug development process for GBM.

         <title>2D Polarized Materials: Ferromagnetic, Ferrovalley, Ferroelectric Materials, and Related Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct physical origin of 2D polarizations and modulation on degrees of freedom are comprehensively summarized based on the hysteresis behaviors and interface effects. The novel multifunctional polarized devices are discussed, from which perspectives and guidelines are proposed for developing &#8220;beyond Moore&#8221; integrated devices and circuits.








Abstract
The emergence of 2D polarized materials, including ferromagnetic, ferrovalley, and ferroelectric materials, has demonstrated unique quantum behaviors at atomic scales. These polarization behaviors are tightly bonded to the new degrees of freedom (DOFs) for next generation information storage and processing, which have been dramatically developed in the past few years. Here, the basic 2D polarized materials system and related devices&#8217; application in spintronics, valleytronics, and electronics are reviewed. Specifically, the underlying physical mechanism accompanied with symmetry broken theory and the modulation process through heterostructure engineering are highlighted. These summarized works focusing on the 2D polarization would continue to enrich the cognition of 2D quantum system and promising practical applications.

         <title>Failing Forward: Stability of Transparent Electrodes Based on Metal Nanowire Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technology is a promising low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide, offering mechanical flexibility and low materials cost. The fundamental failure mechanisms of MNWs, strategies to computationally model MNW networks, characterization strategies, and encapsulation strategies are discussed. Lastly, a perspective on evaluating MNW&#8208;based electrodes based on their technological relevance and cost is presented.








Abstract
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technologies have significantly matured over the last decade to become a prominent low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO). Beyond reaching the same level of performance as ITO, MNW networks offer additional advantages including flexibility and low materials cost. To facilitate adoption of MNW networks as a replacement to ITO, they must overcome their inherent stability issues while maintaining their properties and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the fundamental failure mechanisms of MNW networks are discussed in detail. Recent strategies to computationally model MNWs from the nano&#8208; to macroscale and suggest future work to capture dynamic failure to unravel mechanisms that account for convolution of the failure modes are highlighted. Strategies to characterize MNW network failure in situ and postmortem are also discussed. In addition, recent work about improving the stability of MNW networks via encapsulation is discussed. Lastly, a perspective is given on how to frame the requirements of MNW&#8208;encapsulant hybrids with reference to their target applications, namely: solar cells, transparent film heaters, sensors, and displays. A cost analysis to comment on the feasibility of implementing MNW hybrids is provided, and critical areas to focus on for future work on MNW networks are suggested.
