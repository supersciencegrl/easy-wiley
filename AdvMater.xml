         <title>Reversible Photothermal Modulation of Electrical Activity of Excitable Cells using Polydopamine Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial&#8208;based optical modulation of excitable cells is demonstrated using biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal transducers. In the presence of PDA nanoparticles, neural spiking activity and cardiomyocyte beating rate are reversibly and controllably modulated by applying a near&#8208;IR laser with different power densities. The 3D collagen/PDA foam adds extra capabilities to this neuromodulation platform by localizing the photothermal effect.








Abstract
Advances in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials with desired biophysicochemical properties can be harnessed to develop non&#8208;invasive neuromodulation technologies. Here, the reversible modulation of the electrical activity of neurons and cardiomyocytes is demonstrated using polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal nanotransducers. In addition to their broad light absorption and excellent photothermal activity, PDA nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and biodegradable, making them excellent candidates for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The modulation of the activity (i.e., spike rate of the neurons and beating rate of cardiomyocytes) of excitable cells can be finely controlled by varying the excitation power density and irradiation duration. Under optimal conditions, reversible suppression (&#8776;100%) of neural activity and reversible enhancement (two&#8208;fold) in the beating rate of cardiomyocytes is demonstrated. To improve the ease of interfacing of photothermal transducers with these excitable cells and enable spatial localization of the photothermal stimulus, a collagen/PDA nanoparticle foam is realized, which can be used as an &#8220;add&#8208;on patch&#8221; for photothermal stimulation. The non&#8208;genetic optical neuromodulation approach using biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles represents a minimally invasive method for controlling the activity of excitable cells with potential applications in nano&#8208;neuroscience and engineering.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Unpacking Capsule Containing Zwitterionic Hydrogel&#8208;Coated MOF Nanoparticles for Efficient Oral Exendin&#8208;4 Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic framework nanoparticles is developed for efficient oral exendin&#8208;4 delivery. The capsules are rapidly unpacked in the intestinal environment, driving the rapid release of the nano&#8208;vehicles. The zwitterionic hydrogel layer improves both mucus penetration and internalization by the intestinal epithelial cells of the nanoparticles, leading to markedly enhanced pharmacological availability of exendin&#8208;4.








Abstract
Oral peptide or protein delivery is considered a revolutionary alternative to daily subcutaneous injection; however, major challenges remain in terms of impediments of the gastrointestinal environment and the intestinal epithelium consisting of mucus and the epithelial cell layer, leading to low bioavailability. To protect against gastrointestinal degradation and promote penetration across the intestinal mucosa, a pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles is engineered. The MOF nanoparticles possess a high exendin&#8208;4 loading capacity, and the zwitterionic hydrogel layer imparts unique capability of permeation across the mucus layer and effective internalization by epithelial cells to the nano&#8208;vehicles. In addition to the gastro&#8208;resistant feature, the pH&#8208;responsive capsules are dissociated drastically in the intestinal environment due to the rapid generation of abundant CO2 bubbles, which triggers a sudden release of the nanoparticles. After oral administration of the capsules containing exendin&#8208;4&#8208;loaded nanoparticles into a diabetes rat model, markedly enhanced plasma exendin&#8208;4 levels are achieved for over 8 h, leading to significantly increased endogenous insulin secretion and a remarkable hypoglycemic effect with a relative pharmacological availability of 17.3%. Owing to the low risk of hypoglycemia, this oral exendin&#8208;4 strategy will provide a vast potential for daily and facile diabetes treatment.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for 2D Materials: Application in Noble Metal/TiB2 Heterointerfaces and their Enhanced Catalytic Performance for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between noble metal nanoparticles and TiB2 is directly observed. The resulting catalysts are not only sintering&#8208;resistant up to 800 &#176;C, but also highly efficient for formic acid dehydrogenation. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is a phenomenon commonly observed on heterogeneous catalysts. Here, direct evidence of SMSI between noble metal and 2D TiB2 supports is reported. The temperature&#8208;induced TiB2 overlayers encapsulate the metal nanoparticles, resulting in core&#8211;shell nanostructures that are sintering&#8208;resistant with metal loadings as high as 12.0 wt%. The TiOx&#8208;terminated TiB2 surfaces are the active sites catalyzing the dehydrogenation of formic acid at room temperature. In contrast to the trade&#8208;off between stability and activity in conventional SMSI, TiB2&#8208;based SMSI promotes catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. By optimizing the thickness and coverage of the overlayer, the Pt/TiB2 catalyst displays an outstanding hydrogen productivity of 13.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1cat h&#8722;1 in 10.0 m aqueous solution without any additive or pH adjustment, with &gt;99.9%&#160;selectivity toward CO2 and H2. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the computationally determined trends in metal&#8211;TiB2 interactions are fully consistent with the experimental observations regarding the extent of SMSI on different transition metals. The present research introduces a new means to create thermally stable and catalytically active metal/support interfaces for scalable chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nanomaterials: A New Pathway for Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements toward developing biocatalytic nanomaterials (BCNs) as a new pathway for bacterial disinfection are systematically reviewed. The antibacterial mechanism, classification of BCNs, energy conversion triggered or augmented biocatalytic activities, and biofilms&#8217; eradication have been thoroughly discussed. Besides, the challenges and prospects for biocatalytic disinfection are summarized. This review may offer abundant inspirations for designing new BCNs for combating bacteria/biofilms.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of pathogenic infection has emerged as a growing challenge in global public health. Such treatment is currently limited to antibiotics, but abuse of antibiotics have induced multidrug resistance and high fatality rates in anti&#8208;infection therapies. Thus, it is vital to develop alternative bactericidal agents to open novel disinfection pathways. Drawing inspiration from elements of the human immune system that show great potential for controlling pathogens or regulating cell apoptosis, the design of biocatalytic nanomaterials (BCNs) have provided unrivaled opportunities for future antibacterial therapies. More significantly, BCNs exhibit various superior properties to immune cells and natural enzymes, such as higher biocatalytic performance, extraordinary stability against harsh conditions, and scalable production. In this review, the most recent efforts toward developing BCN&#8208;based biomedical applications in combating bacterial infections are focused upon. BCNs&#8217; antibacterial mechanisms, the classification of BCNs, antibacterial activities that can be triggered or augmented by energy conversion, and the eradication of biofilms with BCNs are systematically introduced and discussed. The current challenges and prospects of BCNs for biocatalytic disinfection are also summarized. It is anticipated this review will provide new therapeutic insights into combating bacteria and biofilms and offer significant new inspiration for designing future biocatalytic nanomaterials.

SnTe/PbTe monolayer lateral heterostructures are experimentally created through a two&#8208;step molecular beam epitaxial growth process. A vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant ferroelectric domain configuration is observed in a van der Waals 2D material heterostructure in this work.








Abstract
Heterostructures formed from interfaces between materials with complementary properties often display unconventional physics. Of especial interest are heterostructures formed with ferroelectric materials. These are mostly formed by combining thin layers in vertical stacks. Here the first in situ molecular beam epitaxial growth and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of atomically sharp lateral heterostructures between a ferroelectric SnTe monolayer and a paraelectric PbTe monolayer are reported. The bias voltage dependence of the apparent heights of SnTe and PbTe monolayers, which are closely related to the type&#8208;II band alignment of the heterostructure, is investigated. Remarkably, it is discovered that the ferroelectric domains in the SnTe surrounding a PbTe core form either clockwise or counterclockwise vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant configurations. In addition, when there is a finite angle between the polarization and the interface, the perpendicular component of the polarization always points from SnTe to PbTe. Supported by first&#8208;principles calculation, the mechanism of vortex formation and preferred polarization direction is identified in the interaction between the polarization, the space charge, and the strain effect at the horizontal heterointerface. The studies bring the application of 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides on in&#8208;plane ferroelectric heterostructures a step closer.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Gels: Fabrications, Functions, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As emerging luminescent materials, aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active (AIE&#8208;active) gels integrate the characteristics of AIE with those of gels, which impart them with various distinctive and advantageous properties in addition to promising application potential. This review provides an overview of the progress of AIE&#8208;active gels in terms of their fabrication, functions, and applications.








Abstract
Chromophores that exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (i.e., aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens [AIEgens]) emit intense fluorescence in their aggregated states, but show negligible emission as discrete molecular species in solution due to the changes in restriction and freedom of intramolecular motions. As solvent&#8208;swollen quasi&#8208;solids with both a compact phase and a free space, gels enable manipulation of intramolecular motions. Thus, AIE&#8208;active gels have attracted significant interest owing to their various distinctive properties and promising application potential. Herein, a comprehensive overview of AIE&#8208;active gels is provided. The fabrication strategies employed are detailed, and the applications of AIEgens are summarized. In addition, the gel functions arising from the AIE moieties are revealed, along with their structure&#8211;property relationships. Furthermore, the applications of AIE&#8208;active gels in diverse areas are illustrated. Finally, ongoing challenges and potential means to address them are discussed, along with future perspectives on AIE&#8208;active gels, with the overall aim of inspiring research on novel materials and ideas.

         <title>Nanodots Derived from Layered Materials: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanodots derived from layered materials not only exhibit the intriguing properties of traditional nanodots due to the size confinement effect, but also inherit some unique properties of layered materials, making them promising candidates in various applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress on the preparation and applications of nanodots derived from layered materials is reviewed.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, black phosphorus, graphitic carbon nitride, hexagonal boron nitride, and MXenes, have attracted intensive attention over the past decades owing to their unique properties and wide applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, etc. Further reducing the lateral size of layered 2D materials down to less than 10&#160;nm allows for preparing a new class of nanostructures, namely, nanodots derived from layered materials. Nanodots derived from layered materials not only can exhibit the intriguing properties of nanodots due to the size confinement originating from the ultrasmall size, but also can inherit some unique properties of ultrathin layered 2D materials, making them promising candidates in a wide range of applications, especially in biomedicine and catalysis. Here, a comprehensive summary on the materials categories, advantages, synthesis methods, and potential applications of these nanodots derived from layered materials is provided. Finally, personal insights about the challenges and future directions in this promising research field are also given.

         <title>Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
There&#160;is a high risk of transmission of airborne pathogens through the nasal epithelium. This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2).








Abstract
Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). Formulation of a polysaccharide&#8208;based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;&#8208;carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Strain Effects on Rashba Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling of 2D Hole Gases in GeSn/Ge Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D hole gas (2DHG) in GeSn/Ge heterostructures and the strongest Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) among group&#8208;IV materials are demonstrated. The SOC strength is controlled by modulating the 2DHG density via top gating, which enables effective spin manipulation for a spin logic device and fast quantum computing for spin qubits via SOC effects.








Abstract
A demonstration of 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures with a mobility as high as 20 000&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is given. Both the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall effect are observed, indicating high sample quality. The Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is investigated via magneto&#8208;transport. Further, a transition from weak localization to weak anti&#8208;localization is observed, which shows the tunability of the SOC strength by gating. The magneto&#8208;transport data are fitted to the Hikami&#8211;Larkin&#8211;Nagaoka formula. The phase&#8208;coherence and spin&#8208;relaxation times, as well as spin&#8208;splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the k&#8208;cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.

A new family of cathodes with superior ionic/electronic conductivities is demonstrated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. No carbon and electrolyte additives are needed in such an &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) cathode so the space and mass of the electrode are fully utilized and high mass/volume energy density are obtained.








Abstract
The energy density presents the core competitiveness of lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. In conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&lt;84 wt% and &lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non&#8208;electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic&#8208;conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic&#8208;conductive network self&#8208;supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)&#8208;based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&#8722;1 and 1945 W h L&#8722;1 at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.

         <title>Adipocyte&#8208;Derived Anticancer Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is engineered to be a controllable, effective, and biocompatible drug delivery system for cancer therapy. It is demonstrated that the lipid droplet can augment the therapeutic performance of an encapsulated drug via several pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a promising material with clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC50 value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0&#8208;fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrimer&#8211;Peptide Conjugates for Early Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Inflammatory Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;target nanoconjugate is developed to target the Alzheimer's disease microenvironment in the early stage. Synergistic therapeutic effects are achieved by scavenging reactive oxygen species, restoring cellular antioxidant capacity, polarizing microglia phenotype, inhibiting formation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid plaques, and recovering immunologic function based on the functional polymers and nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 activating peptide. Cognitive functions are enhanced in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model transgenic mice after treatment.








Abstract
Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments mainly focus on &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) targeting. However, such therapeutic strategies have limited clinical outcomes due to the chronic and irreversible impairment of the nervous system in the late stage of AD. Recently, inflammatory responses, manifested in oxidative stress and glial cell activation, have been reported as hallmarks in the early stages of AD. Based on the crosstalk between inflammatory response and brain cells, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive dendrimer&#8211;peptide conjugate (APBP) is devised to target the AD microenvironment and inhibit inflammatory responses at an early stage. With the modification of the targeting peptide, this nanoconjugate can efficiently deliver peptides to the infected regions and restore the antioxidant ability of neurons by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, this multi&#8208;target strategy exhibits a synergistic function of ROS scavenging, promoting A&#946; phagocytosis, and normalizing the glial cell phenotype. As a result, the nanoconjugate can reduce ROS level, decrease A&#946; burden, alleviate glial cell activation, and eventually enhance cognitive functions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice. These results indicate that APBP can be a promising candidate for the multi&#8208;target treatment of AD.

         <dc:description>
Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated thin&#8208;film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal&#8208;based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue&#8208;adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light&#8208;emitting device is powered by a standard near&#8208;field&#8208;communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (q&#160;&gt; 20). Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue&#8208;device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.

         <title>Engineering the Deformability of Albumin&#8208;Stabilized Emulsions for Lymph&#8208;Node Vaccine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deformable albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsion with self&#8208;adaptive deformability, which can squeeze through the cellular gaps of lymphatic vessels for lymph node (LN) delivery (intercellular pathway), is engineered. Concurrently, they tend to also be internalized and drained to the LNs by the immunocytes (intracellular pathway). Through the dual LN&#8208;transfer, exploiting the deformability may offer an alternative way for efficient LN delivery and vaccinations.








Abstract
A major challenge in vaccine delivery is to achieve robust lymph&#8208;node (LN) accumulation, which can capitalize on concentrated immunocytes and cytokines in LNs to stimulate the onset and persistence of adaptive immune responses. Previous attempts at developing vaccine delivery systems have focused on the sizes, charges, or surface ligands but not on their deformability. In fact, the LN homing of antigen&#8208;presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self&#8208;adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN&#8208;targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.

In fact, the LN homing of antigen-presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin-stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self-adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN-targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin-stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.








Abstract
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate&#8208;field&#8208;dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long&#8208;term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)&#8208;based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Binary Polarization in a Ferroelectric Nanowire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary switching hysteresis in a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is demonstrated by imposing an anisotropic bias field to a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) gate with a diameter of &#8776;250&#160;nm. As switching characteristics of the associated GNR field&#8208;effect transistor, the FNW hosts four polar states: vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out, which are complemented by Landau&#8211;Ginzburg theory modeling.








Abstract
The prediction and observation of supra&#8208;binary polarization in a ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) covered with a semicylindrical gate that provides an anisotropic electric field in the FNW are reported. There are gate&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven transitions between four polarization states in the FNW's cross&#8208;section, dubbed vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out. They are determined by the interplay between the spatial depolarization energy and the free energy induced by an anisotropic external electric field, in clear distinction from the conventional film&#8208;based binary ferroelectricity. When the FNW is mounted on a biased graphene nanoribbon (GNR), these transitions induce exotic current&#8211;voltage hysteresis in the FNW&#8211;GNR transistor. This discovery suggests new operating mechanisms of ferroelectric devices. In particular, it enables intrinsic quaternary&#8208;digit information manipulation in parallel to the bit manipulation employed in conventional data storage.

         <title>Nanoengineered Peptide&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Conductive Supramolecular Biomaterial for Cardiac Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo RGD&#8208;containing peptide is shown to form self&#8208;healing and biocompatible hydrogels. Nanoengineering the network of the peptide hydrogel by polyaniline integration results in a semiconducting composite hydrogel showing excellent antibacterial properties and DNA binding ability. The composite hydrogel further supports the growth of cardiac cells into functional synchronized monolayers, thus highlighting its potential as an excellent supramolecular biomaterial.








Abstract
Owing to their dynamic nature and ordered architecture, supramolecular materials strikingly resemble organic components of living systems. Although short&#8208;peptide self&#8208;assembled nanostructured hydrogels are regarded as intriguing supramolecular materials for biotechnology, their application is often limited due to their low stability and considerable challenge of combining other desirable properties. Herein, a di&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;based hydrogelator containing the cell&#8208;adhesive Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self&#8208;healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity. Cardiac cells grown on the surface of the composite hydrogels form functional synchronized monolayers. Taken together, the combination of these attributes in a single hydrogel suggests it as an exceptional candidate for functional supramolecular biomaterial designed for electrogenic tissue engineering.

         <title>Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting mesostructured niobium carbonitrides with different morphologies are prepared from a single block copolymer via self&#8208;assembly using a variety of new synthetic routes. Superconducting transition temperatures are comparable to bulk analogues but vary with mesostructure, a typical fingerprint of metamaterials, while some materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches. The results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum metamaterials are expected to exhibit a variety of novel properties, but have been a major challenge to prepare as a result of the lack of appropriate synthetic routes to high&#8208;quality materials. Here, the discovery of synthesis routes to block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembly&#8208;directed niobium nitrides and carbonitrides is described. The resulting materials exhibit unusual structure retention even at temperatures as high as 1000 &#176;C and resulting critical temperature, Tc, values comparable to their bulk analogues. Applying the concepts of soft matter self&#8208;assembly, it is demonstrated that a series of four different BCP&#8208;directed mesostructured superconductors are accessible from a single triblock terpolymer. Resulting materials display a mesostructure&#8208;dependent Tc without substantial variation of the XRD&#8208;measured lattice parameters. Finally, field&#8208;dependent magnetization measurements of a sample with double&#8208;gyroid morphology show abrupt jumps comparable in overall behavior to flux avalanches. Results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.

         <title>Boosting the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity for D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Conjugated Microporous Polymers by Statistical Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A copolymer photocatalysts can be boosted through statistical copolymerization by varying the ratio of electron donor to acceptor, and an attractive hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 is obtained by a copolymer (10&#160;mg) with optimized polymer structure, which is also evidenced by a water&#8208;draining experiment.








Abstract
Recently, great progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of conjugated organic polymer photocatalysts for hydrogen generation.

&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic activity of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A copolymer photocatalysts can be boosted through statistical copolymerization by varying the ratio of electron donor to acceptor, and an attractive hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained by a copolymer (10&#160;mg) with optimized polymer structure, which is also evidenced by a water-draining experiment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, great progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of conjugated organic polymer photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. However, it is still challenging to develop an organic polymer photocatalyst with high photoconversion efficiency. Rational structure design of organic polymer photocatalysts holds the key point to realize high photocatalytic performance. Herein, a series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated organic copolymer photocatalysts is developed using statistical copolymerization by tuning the feed molar ratio of pyrene (donor) to dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (acceptor) units. It reveals that the photocatalytic activity of the resulting copolymers is significantly dependent on the molar ratio of donor to acceptor, which efficiently changes the polymer structure and component. When the monomer feed ratio is 25:75, the random copolymer PyBS-3 of 10&#160;mg with Pt cocatalyst shows a high hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under UV/Vis light irradiation using ascorbic acid as the hole-scavenger, and an external quantum efficiency of 29.3% at 420&#160;nm, which represents the state-of-the-art of organic polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D printed and disposable paper supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by a combination of nanocellulose, biopolymers, and carbon nanomaterials leading to monolithic integrated devices with excellent electrochemical properties. The results combining digital material assembly, high performance, and nontoxicity have the potential to move the field of sustainable electronics forward.








Abstract
With the development of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service&#8208;life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste). Fueled by the growing e&#8208;waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy&#8208;storage technologies such as lithium&#8208;ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F&#160;g&#8722;1 active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high&#8208;performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e&#8208;textiles, and healthcare.

         <title>Quicker and More Zn2+ Storage Predominantly from the Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificially constructed VOx sub&#8208;nanometer clusters/rGO composite composed of heterogeneous V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is used as a zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode, in which Zn2+ storage predominantly originates from the interface, while electron conduction occurs on the rGO. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage enables an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their low cost and high&#8208;level safety. However, achieving high energy and high power densities simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a VOx sub&#8208;nanometer cluster/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode material composed of interfacial V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is artificially constructed. Therein, a new mechanism is revealed, where Zn2+ ions are predominantly stored at the interface between VOx and rGO, which causes anomalous valence changes compared to conventional mechanisms and exploits the storage ability of non&#8208;energy&#8208;storing active yet highly conductive rGO. Further, this interface&#8208;dominated storage triggers decoupled transport of electrons/Zn2+ ions, and the reversible destruction/reconstruction allows the interface to store more ions than the bulk. Finally, an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, i.e., capacity retention of 39.4% for a 1000&#8208;fold increase in current density) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, exceeding the theoretical capacities of each interfacial component) are achieved. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage is an exciting way to build high&#8208;energy&#8208; and high&#8208;power&#8208;density devices.

         <title>Efficient and Tunable Reflection of Phonon Polaritons at Built&#8208;In Intercalation Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation&#8208;dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation&#8208;independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built&#8208;in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in polar van der Waals crystals offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale due to their anisotropic and ultralow&#8208;loss propagation. While their analog plasmon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to electron oscillations&#8212;have long been studied and exhibit interesting reflections at geometrical edges and electronic boundaries, whether phonon polaritons can be reflected by such barriers has been elusive. Here, the effective and tunable reflection of phonon polaritons at embedded interfaces formed in hydrogen&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes is elaborated upon. Without breaking geometrical continuity, such intercalation interfaces can reflect phonon polaritons with low losses, yielding the distinct phase changes of &#8722;0.8&#960; and &#8722;0.3&#960; associated with polariton propagation, high efficiency of 50%, and potential electrical tunability. The results point to a new approach to construct on&#8208;demand polariton reflectors, phase modulators, and retarders, which may be transplanted into building future polaritonic circuits using van der Waals crystals.

         <title>Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat&#8208;spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat&#8208;spiral nanofibers endow this electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water&#8208;droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.








Abstract
Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial&#8208;scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat&#8208;spiral&#8208;based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.

     alt="Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat-spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat-spiral nanofibers endow this electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water-droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new-generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial-scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat-spiral-based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state-of-the-art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Uniform Magnesium Electrodeposition via Synergistic Coupling of Current Homogenization, Geometric Confinement, and Chemisorption Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction, a 3D vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber array structure on carbon cloth can regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition and realize a reversible magnesium&#8208;metal anode with high areal capacity, much better kinetics, and improved cycle life.








Abstract
Unevenly distributed magnesium (Mg) electrodeposits have emerged as a major obstacle for Mg&#8208;metal batteries. A comprehensive design matrix is reported for 3D magnesiophilic hosts, which regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction. Vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as &#8220;VNCA@C&#8221;) are developed as a proof of concept. The evenly arranged short nanoarray architecture helps to homogenize the surface current density and the microchannels built in this 3D host allow the preferential nucleation of Mg due to their geometrical confinement effect. Besides, the nitrogen&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;doped carbon species exhibit strong chemisorptive interaction toward Mg atoms, providing preferential nucleation sites as demonstrated by first&#8208;principle calculation results. Electrochemical analysis reveals a peculiar yet highly reversible microchannel&#8208;filling growth&#160;behavior of Mg metals, which empowers the delicately designed VNCA@C host with the ability to deliver a reduced nucleation overpotential of 429&#160;mV at 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an elongated Mg plating/stripping cycle life (110 cycles) under high current density of 10.0 mA cm&#8722;2. The proposed design matrix can be extended to other metal anodes (such as lithium and zinc) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Tough&#8208;Hydrogel Reinforced Low&#8208;Tortuosity Conductive Networks for Stretchable and High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultratough hydrogel reinforcement coating enables a tough and stretchable isotopically low tortuous conductive network. The micro&#8208;open&#8208;porous material demonstrates simultaneously high mechanical robustness, high capacitance, energy and power density when applied as capacitive electrodes. The presented strategy promotes the development of stretchable energy storage devices and opens up new possibilities for the application of tough hydrogels.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are seeing emerging applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. Supercapacitors with high capacitance, high power density, simple form factor, and good mechanical robustness are highly desired, which demands electrode materials with high surface area, high mass loading, good conductivity, larger thickness, low tortuosity, and high toughness. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously realize them in a single material. By compositing a superficial layer of tough hydrogel on conductive and low tortuous foams, a thick capacitor electrode with large capacitance (5.25 F cm&#8208;2), high power density (41.28&#160;mW cm&#8208;2), and good mechanical robustness (&#949;&#160;= 140%, &#915;&#160;= 1000 J m&#8208;2) is achieved. The tough hydrogel serves as both a load&#8208;bearing layer to maintain structural integrity during deformation and a permeable binder to allow interaction between the conductive electrode and electrolyte. It is shown that the tough hydrogel reinforcement is beneficial for both electrical and mechanical stability. With a simple design and facile fabrication, this strategy is generalizable for various conductive materials.

         <title>Co3Se4 Quantum Dots as an Ultrastable Host Material for Potassium&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3Se4 quantum dots encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, in which a morphology change process occurs. The unique core&#8211;shell&#8208;like&#8208;structure anode demonstrates greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially long&#8208;term cyclic performance at various current densities. Density functional theory calculations, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy further reveal the working mechanism of the CSC anode during potassiation/depotassiation.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) are receiving increased attention due to their cost&#8208;effective and similar energy&#8208;storage mechanism to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of appropriate electrode materials is still hampered for their development, which is mainly caused by the large size of the potassium ions (1.38&#160;&#197;) including low structural stability and poor electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. Herein, Co3Se4 quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion&#8208;diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell&#8208;like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.

         <title>From Fundamental Understanding to Engineering Design of High&#8208;Performance Thick Electrodes for Scalable Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>

A critical assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided and practical guidelines offered toward developing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing needs for renewable energy demand the pursuit of batteries with higher energy/power output. A thick electrode design is considered as a promising solution for high&#8208;energy batteries due to the minimized inactive material ratio at the device level. Most of the current research focuses on pushing the electrode thickness to a maximum limit; however, very few of them thoroughly analyze the effect of electrode thickness on cell&#8208;level energy densities as well as the balance between energy and power density. Here, a realistic assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided, such as active material fraction and electrode porosity, which affect the cell&#8208;level energy/power densities of lithium&#8211;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (Li&#8211;NMC622) and lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells as two model battery systems, is provided. Based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium batteries, key research targets are quantified to achieve 500&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1/800&#160;Wh L&#8211;1 cell&#8208;level energy densities and strategies are elaborated to simultaneously enhance energy/power output. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are highlighted toward realizing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.

Here, a realistic assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided, such as active material fraction and electrode porosity, which affect the cell-level energy/power densities of lithium&#8211;LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Li&#8211;NMC622) and lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells as two model battery systems, is provided. Based on the state-of-the-art lithium batteries, key research targets are quantified to achieve 500&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;/800&#160;Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; cell-level energy densities and strategies are elaborated to simultaneously enhance energy/power output. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are highlighted toward realizing scalable high-energy/power energy-storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Efficient Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared at 1040&#160;nm Organic Photodetector Realized by Intermolecular Charge Transfer Mediated Coupling Based on a Squaraine Dye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband near&#8208;infrared organic photodiodes are reported based on a dipolar squaraine dye. J&#8208;type coupling in the solid state allows SQ&#8208;H thin films to combine favorable NIR absorption at 1040&#160;nm and charge carrier mobility. The bulk&#8208;heterojunction with PC61BM yields an organic photodiode with external quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 1050&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 85&#160;nm under short&#8208;circuit condition.








Abstract
A highly sensitive short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, &#955;&#160;&gt; 1000 nm) organic photodiode (OPD) is described based on a well&#8208;organized nanocrystalline bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a dicyanovinyl&#8208;functionalized squaraine dye (SQ&#8208;H) donor material in combination with PC61BM. Through thermal annealing, dipolar SQ&#8208;H chromophores self&#8208;assemble in a nanoscale structure with intermolecular charge transfer mediated coupling, resulting in a redshifted and narrow absorption band at 1040 nm as well as enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimized OPD exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.3% and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of only 85 nm (815 cm&#8722;1) at 1050 nm under 0 V, which is the first efficient SWIR OPD based on J&#8208;type aggregates. Photoplethysmography application for heart&#8208;rate monitoring is successfully demonstrated on flexible substrates without applying reverse bias, indicating the potential of OPDs based on short&#8208;range coupled dye aggregates for low&#8208;power operating wearable applications.

         <title>Digital Electrochemistry for On&#8208;Chip Heterogeneous Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel digital electrochemistry approach is proposed, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical reactions to deposit electroactive materials. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.








Abstract
Many modern electronic applications rely on functional units arranged in an active&#8208;matrix integrated on a single chip. The active&#8208;matrix allows numerous identical device pixels to be addressed within a single system. However, next&#8208;generation electronics requires heterogeneous integration of dissimilar devices, where sensors, actuators, and display pixels sense and interact with the local environment. Heterogeneous material integration allows the reduction of size, increase of functionality, and enhancement of performance; however, it is challenging since front&#8208;end fabrication technologies in microelectronics put extremely high demands on materials, fabrication protocols, and processing environments. To overcome the obstacle in heterogeneous material integration, digital electrochemistry is explored here, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical processes to deposit and address electroactive materials within the pixel array. More specifically, an amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. The digital electrochemistry procedure is studied in&#8208;depth by using polypyrrole (PPy) as a model material. Active&#8208;matrix&#8208;driven multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach for material integration. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerators can efficiently convert biomechanical motion into a characteristically high voltage and low current whilst avoiding collateral heat production, which is known to lead to detrimental localized side effects. The use of triboelectric nanogenerators for electrical stimulation has been validated and demonstrated to be useful in enhancing numerous tissue regeneration processes within the human body to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Such systems are reviewed by Jun Chen and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007502.

         <title>Neurofiber Transistors: Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic neural&#8208;network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are developed by Hyunsu Ju, Jung Ah Lim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100475. These neurofiber transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enable a multichannel synaptic junction of a neural network via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. This work provides insight into the design of the materials and architecture of organic neuromorphic devices with reliable artificial synaptic functionality for artificial neural network learning.

         <title>Mesoporous Superconductors: Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006975, mesoporous superconductors are prepared by Ulrich Wiesner and co&#8208;workers via solution&#8208;based block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly leading to high&#8208;quality quantum metamaterials. The full promise of this soft&#8208;materials approach is realized by producing superconductors with four different mesoscale morphologies. In these materials, the superconducting transition temperatures show variations with mesoscale structure despite nearly identical atomic crystal lattices. The materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches, characteristic of granular materials.

In article number 2101272, Bin Bao, Daniil Karnaushenko, Oliver G. Schmidt, and co&#8208;workers develop a digital electrochemistry approach for on&#8208;chip heterogeneous material integration. An amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (a&#8208;IGZO TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays can be fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <title>Electronic Modulation of Non&#8208;van der Waals 2D Electrocatalysts for Efficient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review of the progress on non&#8208;ven der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D electrocatalysts is presented. Specifically, strategies for engineering the electronic structure of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc., are comprehensively summarized, along with a perspective for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The exploration of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion is important for green energy development. Owing to their high surface areas and unusual electronic structure, 2D electrocatalysts have attracted increasing interest. Among them, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D materials with numerous chemical bonds in all three dimensions and novel chemical and electronic properties beyond those of vdW 2D materials have been studied increasingly over the past decades. Herein, the progress of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is critically reviewed, with a special emphasis on electronic structure modulation. Strategies for heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, pore creation, alloying, and heterostructure engineering are analyzed for tuning electronic structures and achieving intrinsically enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Lastly, a roadmap for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is provided from material, mechanism, and performance viewpoints.

         <title>Recent Progress of Chiral Perovskites: Materials, Synthesis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites are considered to be a promising class of materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices, owing to their superiority in combining chirality and high dielectric constants, high optical&#8208;absorption coefficients, and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, physical properties, and applications of chiral perovskites are reviewed.








Abstract
Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion&#8208;symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power&#8208;conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral perovskites are considered to be a promising class of materials for next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices, owing to their superiority in combining chirality and high dielectric constants, high optical-absorption coefficients, and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, physical properties, and applications of chiral perovskites are reviewed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion-symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power-conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral-halide-perovskite-based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advances in Application of Azobenzene as a Trigger in Biomedicine: Molecular Design and Spontaneous Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of numerous studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use.

Abstract
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of multiple studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use. In recent years, long&#8208;wavelength&#8208;responsive azobenzene has been developed. Matching the longer wavelength absorption and hypoxia&#8208;response characteristics of the azobenzene switch unit to the bio&#8208;optical window results in a large and effective stimulus response. In addition, azobenzene has been used as a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive connector via biological cleavage under appropriate stimulus conditions. This has resulted in on/off state switching of properties such as pharmacology and fluorescence activity. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of azobenzene as a trigger in biomedicine are summarized.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, the recent invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) allows for self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Research on in&#8208; and on&#8208;body TENGs applied for electrical stimulation therapeutics in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering is detailed.








Abstract
Current solutions developed for the purpose of in and on body (IOB) electrical stimulation (ES) lack autonomous qualities necessary for comfortable, practical, and self&#8208;dependent use. Consequently, recent focus has been placed on developing self&#8208;powered IOB therapeutic devices capable of generating therapeutic ES for human use. With the recent invention of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), harnessing passive human biomechanical energy to develop self&#8208;powered systems has allowed for the introduction of novel therapeutic ES solutions. TENGs are especially effective at providing ES for IOB therapeutic systems given their bioconformability, low cost, simple manufacturability, and self&#8208;powering capabilities. Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, TENG&#8208;induced ES holds promise to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic interventions. The aim here is to detail research on IOB TENG devices applied for ES&#8208;based therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering. Furthermore, considering TENG&#8208;produced ES can be measured for sensing applications, this technology is paving the way to provide a fully autonomous personalized healthcare system, capable of IOB energy generation, sensing, and therapeutic intervention. Considering these grounds, it seems highly relevant to review TENG&#8208;ES research and applications, as they could constitute the foundation and future of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Photodetectors: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle for lead&#8208;free perovskites and the progress of typical lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed and discussed. The outlook for future research and applications is then explored.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photodetectors which apply hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as powerful candidates for next&#8208;generation light sensing. Among them, lead&#8208;based ones are the most popular beyond doubt on account of their unique and superior optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, trade&#8208;off toward commercialization exists between nontoxicity and high performance, with the poor stability of lead&#8208;based perovskites, indicating that it is indispensable to substitute lead with nontoxic element meanwhile bringing about a comparable figure of merit of photodetectors and relatively long&#8208;term stability. Herein, recent advances in lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed, analyzing the principle while designing new materials and highlighting some remarkable progress, which are comparable, even superior, to lead&#8208;based photodetectors. Furthermore, their potential strategy in optical communication, image sensing, narrowband photodetection, etc., is examined and a perspective on developing new materials and photodetectors with superior properties for more practical applications is provided.

         <title>Weaving Enzymes with Polymeric Shells for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in enzymes wrapped with protective polymer shells for biomedical applications are summarized. Particular emphasis is given to physical adsorption and chemical conjugation with specific examples of these conjugates/hybrid applications for cancer therapy, detection, and imaging. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and key points are also highlighted in detail.








Abstract
Enzyme therapeutics have received increasing attention due to their high biological specificity, outstanding catalytic efficiency, and impressive therapeutic outcomes. Protecting and delivering enzymes into target cells while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency is a big challenge. Wrapping of enzymes with rational designed polymer shells, rather than trapping them into large nanoparticles such as liposomes, have been widely explored because they can protect the folded state of the enzyme and make post&#8208;functionalization easier. In this review, the methods for wrapping up enzymes with protective polymer shells are mainly focused on. It is aimed to provide a toolbox for the rational design of polymeric enzymes by introducing methods for the preparation of polymeric enzymes including physical adsorption and chemical conjugation with specific examples of these conjugates/hybrid applications. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and key points are emphasized.

         <title>Mechanomaterials: A Rational Deployment of Forces and Geometries in Programming Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging paradigm shift, from passive accesses to mechanics of materials toward proactive functionality programming, is coined as mechanomaterials here. Its rise comes with the rational deployment of force&#8211;geometry&#8211;property relationships at multiples scales, which has delivered diverse functional materials with unprecedented mechanical, optical, electrical, and biological performance, including the explosion of novel actuators, flexible electronics, mechanochromics, and mechaomedicine.








Abstract
The knowledge of mechanics of materials has been extensively implemented in developing functional materials, giving rise to recent advances in soft actuators, flexible electronics, mechanical metamaterials, tunable mechanochromics, regenerative mechanomedicine, etc. While conventional mechanics of materials offers passive access to mechanical properties of materials in existing forms, a paradigm shift is emerging toward proactive programming of materials&#8217; functionality by leveraging the force&#8211;geometry&#8211;property relationships. Here, such a rising field is coined as &#8220;mechanomaterials&#8221;. To profile the concept, the design principles in this field at four scales is first outlined, namely the atomic scale, the molecular scale, the manipulation of nanoscale materials, and the microscale design of structural materials. A variety of techniques have been recruited to deliver the multiscale programming of functional mechanomaterials, such as strain engineering, capillary assembly, topological interlocking, kirigami, origami, to name a few. Engineering optical and biological functionalities have also been achieved by implementing the fundamentals of mechanochemistry and mechanobiology. Nonetheless, the field of mechanomaterials is still in its infancy, with many open challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed. The authors hope this review can serve as a modest spur to attract more researchers to further advance this field.

         <title>Comprehensive Understanding of the Thriving Ambient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia represents the blood of industry and agriculture, crop growth, green energy fuels, and industry production are inseparable from it. The electrochemical ammonia synthesis is expected to replace the harsh and environmentally unfriendly Harber&#8211;Bosch process. Timely and comprehensively review the booming ambient electrochemical ammonia synthesis to promote its rapid and healthy development.








Abstract
The electrochemical method of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia (i.e., the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction [E&#8208;NRR]) continues to draw attention as it is both environmentally friendly and well suited for a progressively distributed farm economy. Despite the multitude of recent works on the E&#8208;NRR, further progress in this field faces a bottleneck. On the one hand, despite the extensive exploration and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error evaluation of E&#8208;NRR catalysts, no study has stood out to become the stage protagonist. On the other hand, the current level of ammonia production (microgram&#8208;scale) is an almost insurmountable obstacle for its qualitative and quantitative determination, hindering the discrimination between true activity and contamination. Herein i) the popular theory and mechanism of the NRR are introduced; ii) a comprehensive summary of the recent progress in the field of the E&#8208;NRR and related catalysts is provided; iii) the operational procedures of the E&#8208;NRR are addressed, including the acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions; iv) the guiding principles and standardized recommendations for the E&#8208;NRR are emphasized and future research directions and prospects are provided.

         <title>An Intrinsically Micro&#8208;/Nanostructured Pollen Substrate with Tunable Optical Properties for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally abundant, spiky pollen grains provide a versatile building block to fabricate flexible, photonically active substrates by taking advantage of intrinsic micro&#8208;/nanostructural properties that influence light&#8211;matter interactions. A pollen substrate can exhibit high transparency and haze in a tunable manner, and such capabilities can be readily utilized to incorporate pollen substrates into solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
There is broad interest in developing photonically active substrates from naturally abundant, minimally processed materials that can help to overcome the environmental challenges of synthetic plastic substrates while also gaining inspiration from biological design principles. To date, most efforts have focused on rationally engineering the micro&#8208; and nanoscale structural properties of cellulose&#8208;based materials by tuning fibril and fiber dimensions and packing along with chemical modifications, while there is largely untapped potential to design photonically active substrates from other classes of natural materials with distinct morphological features. Herein, the fabrication of a flexible pollen&#8208;derived substrate is reported, which exhibits high transparency (&gt;92%) and high haze (&gt;84%) on account of the micro&#8208; and nanostructure properties of constituent pollen particles that are readily obtained from nature and require minimal extraction or processing to form the paper&#8208;like substrate based on colloidal self&#8208;assembly. Experiments and simulations confirm that the optical properties of the pollen substrate are tunable and arise from light&#8211;matter interactions with the spiky surface of pollen particles. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the pollen substrate is incorporated into a functional perovskite solar cell while the tunable optical properties of the intrinsically micro&#8208;/nanostructured pollen substrate can be useful for a wide range of optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Recent Progress in Proximity Coupling of Magnetism to Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic proximity effect in topological insulator&#8208;magnetic materials heterostructures is a promising strategy to optimize new topological phases with potential applications in low&#8208;energy electronics. Progress in this field is summarized with an introduction to the underlying physical mechanisms, a review of emerging material systems for magnetic proximity in topological insulators, and the status and prospects for obtaining new topological phases.








Abstract
Inducing long&#8208;range magnetic order in 3D topological insulators can gap the Dirac&#8208;like metallic surface states, leading to exotic new phases such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect or the axion insulator state. These magnetic topological phases can host robust, dissipationless charge and spin currents or unique magnetoelectric behavior, which can be exploited in low&#8208;energy electronics and spintronics applications. Although several different strategies have been successfully implemented to realize these states, to date these phenomena have been confined to temperatures below a few Kelvin. This review focuses on one strategy: inducing magnetic order in topological insulators by proximity of magnetic materials, which has the capability for room temperature operation, unlocking the potential of magnetic topological phases for applications. The unique advantages of this strategy, the important physical mechanisms facilitating magnetic proximity effect, and the recent progress to achieve, understand, and harness proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic order in topological insulators are discussed. Some emerging new phenomena and applications enabled by proximity coupling of magnetism and topological materials, such as skyrmions and the topological Hall effect, are also highlighted, and the authors conclude with an outlook on remaining challenges and opportunities in the&#160;field.

         <title>Synthesis of a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Perovskite SmTiO2N Bifunctional Photocatalyst via an Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Layered&#8208;Precursor Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type perovskite SmTiO2N photocatalyst with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV is synthesized to show functionalities of both water reduction and oxidation under visible light, whose success is ascribed to the development of an evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy that is of generality for synthesis of other oxynitrides.








Abstract
Development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive oxynitride photocatalysts has been highly inspired for promising solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, but the number of Ti&#8208;based oxynitrides is scarce because of the relatively low thermal stability of Ti4+ ions under ammonia flow. Here, the feasible synthesis of a novel perovskite SmTiO2N from the layered NaSmTiO4 precursor is demonstrated to exhibit wide visible&#8208;light response with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and to show effective water reduction and oxidation functionalities under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The successful preparation mainly results from the synergistic effect of the layered structure of NaSmTiO4 and the evaporation spillover of Na+ ions, both of which are favorable for ammonia diffusion to accelerate the substitution of nitrogen to oxygen atoms and to shorten the nitridation time. The thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of SmTiO2N for water splitting are investigated in detail, and its optimal apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of water oxidation reaches 16.7% at 420&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;nm, higher by far than that of most previous visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts. Interestingly, a series of oxynitrides RTiO2N (R = La, Pr, Nd) are similarly synthesized by the alkali&#8208;metal evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy, demonstrating its generality to prepare visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive (oxy)nitride photocatalysts containing reducible metals for solar energy conversion.

Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block copolymers PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component polymer solar cells, and a record&#8208;high efficiency of 8.64% is obtained.

Abstract
Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block conjugated polymers with a (D1&#8211;A1)&#8211;(D2&#8211;A2) backbone architecture, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Both polymers contain same donor polymer, PBDB&#8208;T, but different polymerized nonfullerene molecule acceptors. Compared to all previously reported materials for SCOSCs, PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 exhibit narrower bandgap for better light harvesting. When incorporated into SCOSCs, the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly improved to over 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (Ect) plus small non&#8208;radiative loss (0.26&#160;eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80&#160;&#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk&#8208;heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of SCOSCs.

Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit relatively small energy loss and improved storage stability under both ambient condition and continued 80 &#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two narrow-bandgap block conjugated polymers with a (D1&#8211;A1)&#8211;(D2&#8211;A2) backbone architecture, namely PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PIDIC2T and PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PTY6, are designed and synthesized for single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Both polymers contain same donor polymer, PBDB-T, but different polymerized nonfullerene molecule acceptors. Compared to all previously reported materials for SCOSCs, PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PIDIC2T and PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PTY6 exhibit narrower bandgap for better light harvesting. When incorporated into SCOSCs, the short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) is significantly improved to over 15&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ct&lt;/sub&gt;) plus small non-radiative loss (0.26&#160;eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80&#160;&#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk-heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state-of-the-art efficiency of SCOSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effective Piezo&#8208;Phototronic Enhancement of Flexible Photodetectors Based on 2D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin&#8208;Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective piezo&#8208;phototronic enhancement of flexible photodetectors based on ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films is demonstrated. Under external strains, the responsivity of the photodetectors can be enhanced by as much as 284%. Our findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect for optimizing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices, and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskites.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are very attractive for optoelectronic applications because of their numerous exceptional properties. The emerging 2D perovskite ferroelectrics, in which are the coupling of spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric effects, as well as photoexcitation and semiconductor behaviors, have great appeal in the field of piezo&#8208;phototronics that enable to effectively improve the performance of optoelectronic devices via modulating the electro&#8208;optical processes. However, current studies on 2D perovskite ferroelectrics focus on bulk ceramics that cannot endure irregular mechanical deformation and limit their application in flexible optoelectronics and piezo&#8208;phototronics. Herein, we synthesize ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films (SCFs) for integration into flexible photodetectors. The in&#8208;plane multiaxial ferroelectricity is evident within the EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs through systematic characterizations. Flexible photodetectors based on EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs are achieved with an impressive photodetection performance. More importantly, optoelectronic EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs incorporated with in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and effective piezoelectric coefficient show great promise for the observation of piezo&#8208;phototronic effect, which is capable of greatly enhancing the photodetector performance. Under external strains, the responsivity of the flexible photodetectors can be modulated by piezo&#8208;phototronic effect with a remarkable enhancement up to 284%. Our findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic devices and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field Tunable Intertwined Checkerboard Charge Order and Nematicity in the Surface Layer of Sr2RuO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the low&#8208;energy electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 is revealed. Small structural distortions lead to radically different properties compared to the bulk with multiple van Hove singularities close to the Fermi energy giving rise to nematic and charge orders. The van Hove singularities can be manipulated by a magnetic field.








Abstract
In strongly correlated electron materials, the electronic, spin, and charge degrees of freedom are closely intertwined. This often leads to the stabilization of emergent orders that are highly sensitive to external physical stimuli promising opportunities for technological applications. In perovskite ruthenates, this sensitivity manifests in dramatic changes of the physical properties with subtle structural details of the RuO6 octahedra, stabilizing enigmatic correlated ground states, from a hotly debated superconducting state via electronic nematicity and metamagnetic quantum criticality to ferromagnetism. Here, it is demonstrated that the rotation of the RuO6 octahedra in the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 generates new emergent orders not observed in the bulk material. Through atomic&#8208;scale spectroscopic characterization of the low&#8208;energy electronic states, four van Hove singularities are identified in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The singularities can be directly linked to intertwined nematic and checkerboard charge order. Tuning of one of these van Hove singularities by magnetic field is demonstrated, suggesting that the surface layer undergoes a Lifshitz transition at a magnetic field of &#8776;32T. The results establish the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 as an exciting 2D correlated electron system and highlight the opportunities for engineering the low&#8208;energy electronic states in these&#160;systems.

         <title>Construction of Aramid Engineering Materials via Polymerization&#8208;Induced para&#8208;Aramid Nanofiber Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a simple &#8220;monomers&#8208;nanofibers&#8208;macroscopic product&#8221; hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach for the preparation of all&#8208;aramid bulk and honeycomb materials, which are difficult to process in traditional ways. These products show excellent mechanical and thermal performance. This work is a breakthrough for the processing of high&#8208;performance engineering polymer material and the industrialization prospect of all&#8208;aramid products deserves further study.








Abstract
The processing of poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) has long been a great challenge. This work reports a simple &#8220;monomers&#8208;nanofibers&#8208;macroscopic product&#8221; (MNM) hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach to build 3D&#160;all&#8208;PPTA engineering materials. This approach mainly includes the preparation of polymerization&#8208;induced aramid nanofibers (PANFs) from monomers and the fabrication of all&#8208;PPTA materials from PANF hydrogel. Various 3D architectures, including simple solid bulks and sophisticated honeycombs (HCs), are obtained after the dehydration and shrinking of the PANF hydrogel. The tensile strength and compressive yield strength of PANF bulk are more than 62 and 90&#160;MPa, respectively, which are comparable to typical engineering plastics. The compressive strength of PANF HC with a density of 360&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;3 is more than 24&#160;MPa. The thermal stability of PANF bulk and PANF HC are as good as that of Kevlar fiber and almost no decomposition occurred before 500&#160;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the MNM process is performed under mild conditions, without high temperature, high pressure, or corrosive solvent. The MNM process is a novel strategy for the processing of all aromatic polyamide materials with complex structures and high performances and would be another development since the breakthrough of liquid crystal spinning technology of PPTA.

         <title>Electrostatically Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Plasmonic Resonances in Solution&#8208;Processed Atomically Thin NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin NbSe2 shows near&#8208;infrared plasmonic resonance that is thickness&#8208;dependant and can be in situ modulated by an electrostatic voltage applied through an ion gel. These results demonstrate a new strategy to access electrostatically tunable near&#8208;infrared plasmonic sources.








Abstract
In the broad spectral range, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) plasmonics find applications in telecommunication, energy harvesting, sensing, and more, all of which would benefit from an electrostatically controllable NIR plasmon source. However, it is difficult to control bulk NIR plasmonics directly with electrostatics because of the strong electric&#8208;field screening effect and high carrier concentration required to support NIR plasmons. Here, this constraint is overcome and the observation of NIR plasmonic resonances that can be modulated electrostatically over a range of &#8776;360 cm&#8211;1 in few&#8208;layer NbSe2 gratings is reported, thanks to the enhanced electrostatics of atomically thin 2D materials and the high&#8208;quality film produced by a solution method. NbSe2 plasmons also render strong field confinement due to their atomic thickness and provide an extra degree of resonance frequency modulation from the layered structure. This study identifies metallic 2D materials as promising (easily produced and well&#8208;performing) candidates to extend electrostatically tunable plasmonics to the technologically important NIR range.

         <title>Marked Passivation Effect of Naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dicarboximides in High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaromatic passivator 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl substituted naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide provides chemical passivation (protonic/Lewis&#8208;base groups system) and energetic passivation (creating benign midgap states) effects. The Lewis&#8208;base/polyaromatic conjugation/protonic system reduces defects efficiently and avoids superoxide anions in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
As game&#8208;changers in the photovoltaic community, perovskite solar cells are making unprecedented progress while still facing grand challenges such as improving lifetime without impairing efficiency. Herein, two structurally alike polyaromatic molecules based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI) and perylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI) with different molecular dipoles are applied to tackle this issue. Contrasting the electronically pull&#8211;pull cyanide&#8208;substituted PMI (9CN&#8208;PMI) with only Lewis&#8208;base groups, the push&#8211;pull 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl&#8208;substituted NMI (4OH&#8208;NMI) with both protonic and Lewis&#8208;base groups can provide better chemical passivation for both shallow&#8208; and deep&#8208;level defects. Moreover, combined theoretical and experimental studies show that the 4OH&#8208;NMI can bind more firmly with perovskite and the polyaromatic backbones create benign midgap states in the excited perovskite to suppress the damage by superoxide anions (energetic passivation). The polar and protonic nature of 4OH&#8208;NMI facilitates band alignment and regulates the viscosity of the precursor solution for thicker perovskite films with better morphology. Consequently, the 4OH&#8208;NMI&#8208;passivated perovskite films exhibit reduced grain boundaries and nearly three&#8208;times lower defect density, boosting the device efficiency to 23.7%. A more effective design of the passivator for perovskites with multi&#8208;passivation mechanisms is provided in this study.

         <title>Facet Engineering to Regulate Surface States of Topological Crystalline Insulator Bismuth Rhombic Dodecahedrons for Highly Energy Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.








Abstract
Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single&#8208;crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, leading to a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high&#8208;rate formate production and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds as Versatile Reagents for Extremely Efficient and Reversible Patterning of Graphene with Nanoscale Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene are demonstrated by using hypervalent iodine compounds in combination with laser writing, realizing the first patterned hydroxylation as well as unprecedented degrees of patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation of graphene. The graphene patterning is completely reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over 2D chemical information on graphene.








Abstract
Rational patterning and tailoring of graphene relies on the disclosure of suitable reagents for structuring the target functionalities on the 2D&#8208;carbon network. Here, a series of hypervalent iodine compounds, namely, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxol&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;one, 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole, and 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole is reported to be extremely efficient for a diversified graphene patterning. The decomposition of these compounds generates highly reactive Cl, OH, and CF3 radicals exclusively in the irradiated areas, which subsequently attach onto the graphene leading to locally controlled chlorination, hydroxylation, and trifluoromethylation, respectively. This is the first realization of a patterned hydroxylation of graphene, and the degrees of functionalization of the patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation are both unprecedented. The usage of these mild reagents here is reasonably facile compared to the reported methods using hazardous Cl2 or ICl and allows for sophisticated pattern designs with nanoscale precision, promising for arbitrary nanomanipulation of graphene's properties like hydrophilicity and conductivity by the three distinct functionalities (Cl, OH, and CF3). Moreover, the attachment of functional entities to these highly functionalized graphene nanoarchitectures is fully reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling a full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over the chemical information stored within graphene. This work provides an exciting clue for target 2D functionalization and modulation of graphene by using suitable hypervalent iodine compounds.

         <title>2D High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide alloys containing 4 or 5 transition metals are synthesized based on first&#8208;principles stability predictions. The 5&#8208;component alloy (MoWVNbTa)S2 is shown to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into CO. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that a small concentration of highly active sites is responsible for the high activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys combine multiple principal elements at a near equal fraction to form vast compositional spaces to achieve outstanding functionalities that are absent in alloys with one or two principal elements. Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five&#8208;component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s&#8722;1 at &#8776; &#8722;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi&#8208;site catalysis wherein the atomic&#8208;scale disorder optimizes the rate&#8208;limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal edge sites with weak CO binding. 2D high&#8208;entropy TMDC alloys provide a materials platform to design superior catalysts for many electrochemical systems.

         <title>Manipulating Ferromagnetism in Few&#8208;Layered Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy&#8208;axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to the in&#8208;plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature. The surface of the sample is fully exposed in this type of devices, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible.








Abstract
The discovery of magnetism in 2D materials offers new opportunities for exploring novel quantum states and developing spintronic devices. In this work, using field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC&#8208;FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy&#8208;axis switching in few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to an in&#8208;plane direction by electric field in the few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few&#8208;layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC&#8208;FET device configuration, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.

         <title>Nanotexture Shape and Surface Energy Impact on Electroadhesive Human&#8211;Machine Interface Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion&#8208;based haptics technology has received substantial attention in recent years and has seen a rapidly expanding inclusion in current ubiquitous interactive touch surfaces. This work studies the underlying multiphysics mechanism at the nanoasperity level and provides a novel insight for the design and optimization of future electroadhesive finger&#8211;device interfaces for higher efficiency and reduced variability.








Abstract
With the ubiquity of touch screens and the commercialization of electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices, modeling tools that capture the multiphysical phenomena within the finger&#8211;device interface and their interaction are critical to design devices that achieve higher performance and reliability at lower cost. While electroadhesion has successfully demonstrated the capability to change tactile perception through friction modulation, the mechanism of electroadhesion in the finger&#8211;device interface is still unclear, partly due to the complex interfacial physics including contact deformation, capillary formation, electric field, and their complicated coupling effects that have not been addressed comprehensively. A multiphysics model is presented here to predict the friction force for finger&#8211;surface tactile interactions at the nanoscale. The nanoscopic multiphysical phenomena are coupled to study the impacts of nanotexture and surface energy in the touch interface. With macroscopic friction force measurements as verification, the model is further used to propose textures that have maximum electroadhesion effect and minimum sensitivity to relative humidity and user perspiration rate. This model can guide the performance improvement of future electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices and other touch&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Emulsion&#8208;Guided Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Particles: Droplet Size Determines Particle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of a series of novel anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) using an emulsion&#8208;templating method is described. The geometry of the APPs is determined by the average size of the oil droplets, based on a new mechanism. The APPs can be converted to anisotropic carbon particles with their architectures, which can be used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Anisotropic particles have attracted significant attention due to their alluring features that distinguish them from isotropic particles. One of the most appealing strategies for the synthesis of anisotropic particles is the emulsion&#8208;guided method. However, morphological control and the understanding of formation mechanisms have remained a major challenge. Based on a novel mechanism, here, a facile one&#8208;pot emulsion&#8208;templating method for the tunable construction of anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) with different defined structures is reported. Three types of monocomponent APPs with new morphologies and sizes in the range of 240&#8211;650&#160;nm, including Janus mushroom&#8208;like mesoporous poly(m&#8208;phenylenediamine) (PmPD) particles, wheel&#8208;shaped particles, and acorn&#8208;like PmPD particles, are obtained by controlling the average size of the oil droplets in the emulsion. Furthermore, the APPs demonstrate the ability for conversion to nitrogen&#8208;doped anisotropic carbon particles (ACPs) by pyrolysis at 800&#160;&#176;C under a N2 atmosphere, thereby inheriting their structures. These novel ACPs show appreciable potential as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for use in oxygen reduction reactions. Compared to their isotropic counterpart, these ACPs exhibit remarkable advantages such as enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, reduced stacking density, and easy fabrication of continuous and uniform membrane electrodes.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Activatable Dynamic Nanoparticles Boosting Ferroptotic Cell Death for Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable nanoparticles integrating dynamic covalent bonds are developed for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL&#8208;3 and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nanoparticle&#8208;based GPX4 inhibition and PDT significantly promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and activate the T&#8208;cell immune response for inhibiting tumor growth and suppressing distant metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows promising therapeutic potential for long&#8208;term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy displays a low response rate due to insufficient immunogenicity of the tumor cells. To address these challenges, herein, intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable dynamic nanoparticles for eliciting immunogenicity by inducing ferroptosis of the tumor cells are engineered. The nanoparticles are engineered by integrating an ionizable block copolymer and acid&#8208;liable phenylboronate ester (PBE) dynamic covalent bonds for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of the ferroptosis inducer, a glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL&#8208;3. The nanoparticles can stably encapsulate RSL&#8208;3 inside the hydrophobic core via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with the PBE groups at neutral pH (pH = 7.4), while releasing the payload in the endocytic vesicles (pH = 5.8&#8211;6.2) by acidity&#8208;triggered cleavage of the PBE dynamic covalent bonds. Furthermore, the nanoparticles can perform acid&#8208;activatable photodynamic therapy&#160;by protonation of the ionizable core, and significantly recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes for interferon gamma secretion, and thus sensitize the tumor cells to RSL&#8208;3&#8208;inducible ferroptosis. The combination of nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Progress of Nonprecious&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for hydrogen generation and carbon dioxide reduction. This review comprehensively summarizes the thermodynamics, Pourbaix diagram, theoretical screening and prediction, catalytic performance, as well as reaction kinetics and mechanisms of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER.








Abstract
Water oxidation, or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which combines two oxygen atoms from two water molecules and releases one oxygen molecule, plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for the hydrogen generation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large&#8208;scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts such as carbon&#8208;based materials, earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers and Devices for Extreme and Hostile Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural systems, a self&#8208;healing function provides exceptional advantages to enhance the robustness and stability of engineering materials, components, and devices. Self&#8208;healing in extreme or harsh environments, such as those in space, the deep ocean, and nuclear applications, are considered. The self&#8208;healing functions, operation mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Engineering materials and devices can be damaged during their service life as a result of mechanical fatigue, punctures, electrical breakdown, and electrochemical corrosion. This damage can lead to unexpected failure during operation, which requires regular inspection, repair, and replacement of the products, resulting in additional energy consumption and cost. During operation in challenging, extreme, or harsh environments, such as those encountered in high or low temperature, nuclear, offshore, space, and deep mining environments, the robustness and stability of materials and devices are extremely important. Over recent decades, significant effort has been invested into improving the robustness and stability of materials through either structural design, the introduction of new chemistry, or improved manufacturing processes. Inspired by natural systems, the creation of self&#8208;healing materials has the potential to overcome these challenges and provide a route to achieve dynamic repair during service. Current research on self&#8208;healing polymers remains in its infancy, and self&#8208;healing behavior under harsh and extreme conditions is a particularly untapped area of research. Here, the self&#8208;healing mechanisms and performance of materials under a variety of harsh environments are discussed. An overview of polymer&#8208;based devices developed for a range of challenging environments is provided, along with areas for future research.

         <title>Powering Electronic Devices from Salt Gradients in AA&#8208;Battery&#8208;Sized Stacks of Hydrogel&#8208;Infused Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most powerful electric fish, the Atlantic torpedo ray, uses sheet&#8208;like electrically active cells within its electric organs to produce external electrical discharges of up to 1&#160;kW. A paper&#8208;based artificial electric organ is presented, which mimics the torpedo strategies for optimal power generation, resulting in a small and potentially biocompatible energy&#8208;storage device capable of operating real&#8208;world electronics.








Abstract
Strongly electric fish use gradients of ions within their bodies to generate stunning external electrical discharges; the most powerful of these organisms, the Atlantic torpedo ray, can produce pulses of over 1&#160;kW from its electric organs. Despite extensive study of this phenomenon in nature, the development of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable, wearable, or implantable human use has remained out of reach. Previously, an artificial electric organ inspired by the electric eel demonstrated that electricity generated from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels can exceed 100&#160;V. The current of this power source, however, was&#160;too low to power standard electronics. Here, an artificial electric organ inspired by the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for maximal current output is introduced. This power source uses a hybrid material of hydrogel&#8208;infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin, arbitrarily large gel films in series and in parallel. The resulting increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the original eel&#8208;inspired design makes it possible to power electronic devices and establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power can now be realized from benign and soft materials in a portable size.

         <title>Orthorhombic Cobalt Ditelluride with Te Vacancy Defects Anchoring on Elastic MXene Enables Efficient Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) are successfully fabricated to enhance performance in potassium storage. The o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode displays extraordinary structural stability, superior reversible capacity, exceptional rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, as well as reliable operation in flexible advanced potassium&#8208;ion full batteries.








Abstract
The fast and reversible potassiation/depotassiation of anode materials remains an elusive yet intriguing goal. Herein, a class of the P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires with Te vacancy defects supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) is designed and prepared, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the conductive o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2 arrays with rich Te vacancy defects and the elastic MXene sheets with self&#8208;autoadjustable function. Consequently, the o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1), representing the best performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenides&#8208;based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage. Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K+ ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.

         <title>Construction of Supercapacitor&#8208;Based Ionic Diodes with Adjustable Bias Directions by Using Poly(ionic liquid) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulation strategy to design bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable supercapacitor&#8208;diodes is demonstrated. Such multifunctional devices show excellent charge&#8208;storage performance and rectification performance, which fills a gap in the current capacitive ionic diodes.








Abstract
The newly emerging supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode), integrating the characteristics of a diode into an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor, can be employed to extend conventional supercapacitors to new technological applications and may play a crucial role in grid stabilization, signal propagation, and logic operations. However, the reported CAPodes have only been able to realize charge storage in the positive&#8208;bias direction. Here, bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable CAPodes realized by using a polycation&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) or a polyanion&#8208;based IL as electrolyte in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor architecture are proposed. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage function at only the positive&#8208; or negative&#8208;bias direction with a high rectification ratio (&#8776;80% for rectification ratio II, RRII) and an outstanding cycling life (4500 cycles), representing a crucial breakthrough for designing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser&#8208;based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.








Abstract
Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand&#8208;capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size&#8208;controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc&#8208;like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core&#8208; or surface&#8208;based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.

         <title>Significant Performance Improvement in n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with C60:C70 Co&#8208;Crystals Induced by Poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanodots</title>

18&#8208;fold enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n&#8208;channel organic field&#8208;effect transistors with co&#8208;crystalized C60:C70 blend films formed on the nanodot structured dipolar poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n&#8208;channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large&#8208;scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long&#8208;term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier&#8208;injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non&#8208;conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n&#8208;channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) and (C70&#8208;D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene (C70) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The high relative mobility and eighteen&#8208;fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic C60:C70 co&#8208;crystal structure within the blend films.

         <title>Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topographical design space is immense, with many geometries existing. To explore this design space on cell behavior, the TopoChip is utilized with 2176 unique microtopographies. Nevertheless, phenotypical readouts are potentially lost due to an incomplete design space coverage. This coverage is expanded effectively in this work by including natural surfaces such as the red rose, leading to novel phenotypical discoveries.








Abstract
Surface topography is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. However, the large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to design algorithm limitations and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, it is assessed as to what extent the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses can be expanded using natural surfaces. To this end, 26 plant and insect surfaces are replicated in polystyrene and their surface properties are quantified using white light interferometry. Through machine&#8208;learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Furthermore, differentiation experiments reveal the strong potential of the holy lotus to improve osteogenesis in MSCs. In the future, the design algorithms will be trained with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to explore the bioactive properties of novel surface topographies.

         <title>Transparent Omni&#8208;Directional Stretchable Circuit Lines Made by a Junction&#8208;Free Grid of Expandable Au Lines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to fabricate omni&#8208;directional stretchable gold (Au) circuit lines with high transparency, high electrical conductivity, and negligible resistance change is presented. Metals are deposited directly over the crack&#8208;controlled poly(dimethylsiloxane) surface forming grid inside the cracks. This study demonstrates a highly transparent, stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode with a patterned Au line circuit board.








Abstract
Although various stretchable optoelectronic devices have been reported, omni&#8208;directionally stretchable transparent circuit lines have been a great challenge. Cracks are engineered and fabricated to be highly conductive patterned metal circuit lines in which gold (Au) grids are embedded. Au is deposited selectively in the cracks to form a grid without any junction between the grid lines. Since each grid line is expandable under stretching, the circuit lines are stretchable in all the directions. This study shows that a thin coating of aluminum on the oxide surface enables precise control of the cracks (crack density, crack depth) in the oxide layer. High optical transparency and high stretchability can be achieved simultaneously by controlling the grid density in the circuit line. Light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated directly on the circuit lines and stable operation is demonstrated under 100% stretching.

         <title>Dynamically Crosslinked Dry Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomers for Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self&#8208;healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), self&#8208;healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self&#8208;healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.

         <title>Germanium Nanosheets with Dirac Characteristics as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge nanosheets with &#8730;3 &#215;&#160;&#8730;3 germanene as the top layer are successfully grown on a Ag (111) substrate. Dirac characteristics, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and large nonlinear absorption coefficient are experimentally observed from the Ge nanosheets, which are further applied as new saturable absorbers to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized.








Abstract
Bulk germanium as a group&#8208;IV photonic material has been widely studied due to its relatively large refractive index and broadband and low propagation loss from near&#8208;infrared to mid&#8208;infrared. Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier&#8208;relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group&#8208;IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.

Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier-relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode-locked laser, and sub-picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group-IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Harvesting Cool Daylight in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Halides Microtubules through the Reservation of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After pressure processing, the quenched products possess unexpected intense emission exceeding ten times compared to the initial state, accompanied by efficient color temperature tuning from weak sky blue to very bright cool daylight. The irreversible electronic transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules, is highly responsible for the eventual retention of pressure&#8208;induced emission.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is extensively studied in halide perovskites or derivative hybrid halides. However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2ZnBr4) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of &#8220;sky blue light&#8221; before compression to &#8220;cool daylight&#8221; with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next&#8208;generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>Crowning Metal Ions by Supramolecularization as a General Remedy toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general supramolecularization strategy with size&#8208;matching crown ethers is proposed to protect alkali&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). The unique electrostatic shielding layer and organic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) induced by the crown ether&#8211;Li+/Na+/K+ assembly effectively inhibit the growth of alkali&#8208;metal dendrites and largely improve the lifespan of alkali&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Alkali metals have low potentials and high capacities, making them ideal anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries, but they suffer major problems, including dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (CE). Achieving uniform metal deposition and having a reliable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are the basic requirements for overcoming these problems. Here, a general remedy is reported for various alkali&#8208;metal anodes by the supramolecularization of alkali&#8208;metal cations with crown ethers that follows a size&#8208;matching rule. The positively charged supramolecular complex provides electrostatic shielding layers to regulate metal deposition and suppress dendrite formation. More promisingly, it reforms electric double layers and drives the production of organic&#8208;dominated SEIs with improved flexibility that can accommodate large volume changes. The high flexibility of SEIs during metal deposition and dissolution reduces the amount of dead metal and improves CE and cycling stability. Specifically, a 200% excess Li&#8208;based full cell has a capacity retention of &#8776;100% after 100 cycles. This crown&#8208;like supramolecularization strategy is a new chemistry that may be used for the production of dendrite&#8208;free metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries not limited to the cases with alkali metal. It is also expected as a practical technology to improve the uniformity of coatings produced in the electrodeposition industry.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atomic Iron&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Integrated 3D&#8208;Printed Bioscaffolds for Osteosarcoma Destruction with Antibacterial and Bone Defect Regeneration Bioactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;catalyst&#8208;engineered 3D scaffolds for osteosarcoma therapy and bone regeneration are reported. A single&#8208;atomic iron catalyst with highly effective hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced catalytic radical generating activities is engineered into a 3D&#8208;printed bioglass scaffold to achieve comprehensive osteosarcoma elimination, antibacterial properties, and bone defect regeneration with biocompatibility.








Abstract
Effective antitumor therapeutics with distinctive bactericidal and osteogenic properties are in high demand for comprehensive osteosarcoma treatment. Here, a &#8220;scaffold engineering&#8221; strategy that integrates highly active single&#8208;atomic iron catalysts (FeSAC) into a 3D printed bioactive glass (BG) scaffold is reported. Based on the atomically dispersed iron species within the catalysts, the engineered FeSAC displays prominent Fenton catalytic activity to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in response to the microenvironment specific to osteosarcoma. In addition, the constructed FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for efficient osteosarcoma ablation, with concomitant bacterial sterilization via localized hyperthermia&#8208;reinforced nanocatalytic therapeutics. The destruction of the osteosarcoma, as well as the bacterial foci, can be achieved, further preventing susceptible chronic osteomyelitis during osteogenesis. In particular, the engineered FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold is identified with advances in accelerated osteoconduction and osteoinduction, ultimately contributing to the sophisticated therapeutics and management of osteosarcoma. This work broadens the biomedical potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts and offers a comprehensive clinically feasible strategy for overall osteosarcoma therapeutics, bacterial inhibition, and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamic Polymers for Modular Assembling and Reconfigurable Morphing Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic dynamic polymer composites composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in thermally reversible dynamic polymer networks for multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable architectures are reported. These composites integrate the functionalities of targeted welding of modular assembling with complex actuation, magnetization reprogramming with altered shape&#8208;morphing mode, and remote&#8208;controlled permanent structural reconfiguration, opening a new avenue for manufacturing multifunctional and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing magnetic soft materials, composed of magnetic particles in a soft polymer matrix, can transform shape reversibly, remotely, and rapidly, finding diverse applications in actuators, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. To achieve on&#8208;demand and sophisticated shape morphing, the manufacture of structures with complex geometry and magnetization distribution is highly desired. Here, a magnetic dynamic polymer (MDP) composite composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in a dynamic polymer network with thermally responsive reversible linkages, which permits functionalities including targeted welding for magnetic&#8208;assisted assembly, magnetization reprogramming, and permanent structural reconfiguration, is reported. These functions not only provide highly desirable structural and material programmability and reprogrammability but also enable the manufacturing of functional soft architected materials such as 3D kirigami with complex magnetization distribution. The welding of magnetic&#8208;assisted modular assembly can be further combined with magnetization reprogramming and permanent reshaping capabilities for programmable and reconfigurable architectures and morphing structures. The reported MDP are anticipated to provide a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of future multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.

         <title>A Gas&#8208;Steamed MOF Route to P&#8208;Doped Open Carbon Cages with Enhanced Zn&#8208;Ion Energy Storage Capability and Ultrastability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open&#8208;wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one&#8208;step process. Taking advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage performance is displayed.








Abstract
Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a solid&#8208;state gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention. Particularly, such OCCs as electrode materials lead to a soft&#8208;pack ZHSC device, delivering a high energy density of 97&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a superb power density of 6.5&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.

&lt;p&gt;Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas-steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open-wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one-step process. Taking advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn-ion energy-storage performance is displayed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy-storage systems. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, a solid-state gas-steamed metal&#8211;organic-framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention.

         <title>Engineering Fe&#8211;N Coordination Structures for Fast Redox Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom Fe and Fe2N composite sites, with dual&#8208;tailed Fe&#8211;N coordination structures, co&#8208;decorated on N&#8208;doped graphene is successfully constructed and demonstrated. The catalyst optimizes the polysulfide absorption&#8211;catalysis behavior, thereby facilitating fast redox conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling stability.








Abstract
Critical drawbacks, including sluggish redox kinetics and undesirable shuttling of polysulfides (Li2Sn, n&#160;= 4&#8211;8), seriously deteriorate the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;Fe and polar Fe2N are co&#8208;embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA&#8208;Fe, with plane&#8208;symmetric Fe&#8208;4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe&#8208;3N coordination, in this well&#8208;designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement&#8211;catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2Sn&#8596;Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S battery based on the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70&#160;wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts for long&#8208;lasting Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Modulation of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque from SrRuO3 by Epitaxial&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Octahedral Rotation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal oxide perovskite oxides can have pronounced Berry phase curvatures and moderate electric conductivity, making them good sources of spin&#8211;orbit torque. The spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency of SrRuO3 of three different crystal phases is investigated. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency is strongly correlated to the in&#8208;plane octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which arises from the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of conduction electrons, is believed to be the key route for developing low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed, and nonvolatile memory devices. Despite the theoretical prediction of pronounced Berry phase curvatures in certain transition&#8208;metal perovskite oxides, which lead to considerable intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, SOT from this class of materials has rarely been reported until recently. Here, the SOT generated by epitaxial SrRuO3 of three different crystal structures is systematically studied. The results of both spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and in&#8208;plane harmonic Hall voltage measurements concurrently reveal that the intrinsic SOT efficiency of SrRuO3 decreases when the epitaxial strain changes from tensile to compressive. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of SOT and octahedral rotation around the in&#8208;plane axes of SrRuO3, consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work offers new possibilities of tuning SOT with crystal structures and novel opportunities of integrating the unique properties of perovskite oxides with spintronic functionalities.

         <title>Multimodal Tuning of Synaptic Plasticity Using Persistent Luminescent Memitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters emulates synaptic plasticity and memory without requiring sophisticated devices. Experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. Multichannel image memorization involving persistent luminescent memitters allows direct visualization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory.








Abstract
Mimicking memory processes, including encoding, storing, and retrieving information, is critical for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Synaptic behavior simulations through electronic, magnetic, or photonic devices based on metal oxides, 2D materials, molecular complex and phase change materials, represent important strategies for performing computational tasks with enhanced power efficiency. Here, a special class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters (termed as a portmanteau of &#8220;memory&#8221; and &#8220;emitter&#8221;) with optical characteristics closely resembling those of biological synapses is reported. The memory process and synaptic plasticity can be successfully emulated using such memitters under precisely controlled excitation frequency, wavelength, pulse number, and power density. The experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. The use of persistent luminescent memitters for multichannel image memorization that allows direct visualization of subtle changes in luminescence intensity and realization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory is also demonstrated. These findings may promote the discovery of new functional materials as artificial synapses and enhance the understanding of memory mechanisms.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Acrylate Liquid Single Crystal Elastomers Reinforced by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical approach to fabricating monodomain LCE based on aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, compatible with both liquid and gel alignment techniques, to manufacture actuators with versatile shapes. The facile process involving simply mixing two components is enabled by the two&#8208;stage differentiated kinetics of primary amines toward acrylates, generating hydrogen bonding, enhancing the mechanical properties of the elastomer.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been considered one of the most promising material concepts for artificial muscles. However, accomplishing actuation of LCEs requires macroscopic alignment of the liquid&#8208;crystalline orientation in the rubbery network, which imposes challenges in the materials chemistry and processing. A two&#8208;stage curing strategy has been the dominating approach during last three decades. Despite its many successes, the method is difficult in practice and requires delicate experiential skills, dealing with intrinsic fragility of intermediate gels after the first crosslinking stage. Here, a robust fabrication method for monodomain LCE based on the amine&#8208;acrylate aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, involving two readily commercially available components with no catalyst. The method is based on the large kinetic difference of hydrogen addition in primary amines to acrylates, which offers a sufficient gap separating two stages of curing and enabling versatile mechanical alignment techniques for manufacturing monodomain LCE in both liquid and gel states. Importantly, the mechanically robust network, helping processability at a partial&#8208;crosslinking stage, is facilitated by the chemically generated hydrogen bonding all through the process, as a by&#8208;product of hydrogen addition. Such a facile two&#8208;component kit&#8208;like fabrication should aid researchers from various fields in the search for a practical and reliable process of making soft actuators.

The method is based on the large kinetic difference of hydrogen addition in primary amines to acrylates, which offers a sufficient gap separating two stages of curing and enabling versatile mechanical alignment techniques for manufacturing monodomain LCE in both liquid and gel states. Importantly, the mechanically robust network, helping processability at a partial-crosslinking stage, is facilitated by the chemically generated hydrogen bonding all through the process, as a by-product of hydrogen addition. Such a facile two-component kit-like fabrication should aid researchers from various fields in the search for a practical and reliable process of making soft actuators.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Imprinting: Green Perspectives and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increasing concerns about the detrimental impacts of unsustainable molecular imprinting technology (MIT), MIT has veered toward greener pathways. Fourteen green principles specifically for MIT are codified using a nomenclature of &#8220;GREENIFICATION.&#8221; All aspects of greenificated MITs, including fundamentals, strategies, and future perspectives, are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, a roadmap of greenificated MIT from 2012 to 2030 is proposed.








Abstract
Advances in revolutionary technologies pose new challenges for human life; in response to them, global responsibility is pushing modern technologies toward greener pathways. Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) is a multidisciplinary mimic technology simulating the specific binding principle of enzymes to substrates or antigens to antibodies; along with its rapid progress and wide applications, MIT faces the challenge of complying with green sustainable development requirements. With the identification of environmental risks associated with unsustainable MIT, a new aspect of MIT, termed green MIT, has emerged and developed. However, so far, no clear definition has been provided to appraise green MIT. Herein, the implementation process of green chemistry in MIT is demonstrated and a mnemonic device in the form of an acronym, GREENIFICATION, is proposed to present the green MIT principles. The entire greenificated imprinting process is surveyed, including element choice, polymerization implementation, energy input, imprinting strategies, waste treatment, and recovery, as well as the impacts of these processes on operator health and the environment. Moreover, assistance of upgraded instrumentation in deploying greener goals is considered. Finally, future perspectives are presented to provide a more complete picture of the greenificated MIT road map and to pave the way for further development.

         <title>Innovations in Disease State Responsive Soft Materials for Targeting Extracellular Stimuli Associated with Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, the field of programmable soft materials for biomedical applications has rapidly expanded. Herein, recent advances that show promising results in preclinical animal models are described for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Efforts have focused on materials capable of sensing disease&#8208;associated endogenous stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes.








Abstract
Recent advances in polymer chemistry, materials sciences, and biotechnology have allowed the preclinical development of sophisticated programmable nanomedicines and materials that are able to precisely respond to specific disease&#8208;associated triggers and microenvironments. These stimuli, endogenous to the targeted diseases, include pH, redox&#8208;state, small molecules, and protein upregulation. Herein, recent advances and innovative approaches in programmable soft materials capable of sensing the aforementioned disease&#8208;associated stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes including morphological and size transitions, changes in mobility and retention, as well as disassembly are described. In this field generally, the majority of ongoing and past research effort has focused on oncology. Given this interest, examples of the latest innovative approaches to chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy treatment strategies for cancer are presented. Moreover, as the field broadens its attention, applications of programmable materials in other diseases are highlighted, with a special focus on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, where limited attention is paid by the field, but where many promising avenues exist with high potential impact.

         <title>Multimodal Digital X&#8208;ray Scanners with Synchronous Mapping of Tactile Pressure Distributions using Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multimodal integration of perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors and pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors, synchronous mapping of internal structures and morphologies of the object is realized. This work provides the simultaneous imaging of anatomical structures and the pressure distribution using the multiplexed platform, thereby indicating the substantial potential of the system for next&#8208;generation, non&#8208;destructive inspection and medical diagnosis.








Abstract
Visual and tactile information are the key intuitive perceptions in sensory systems, and the synchronized detection of these two sensory modalities can enhance accuracy of object recognition by providing complementary information between them. Herein, multimodal integration of flexible, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detectors with a synchronous mapping of tactile pressure distributions for visualizing internal structures and morphologies of an object simultaneously is reported. As a visual&#8208;inspection method, perovskite materials that convert X&#8208;rays into charge carriers directly are synthesized. By incorporating pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors in the perovskite components, X&#8208;ray detectors with dual modalities (i.e., vision and touch) are attained as an active&#8208;matrix platform for digital visuotactile examinations. Also, in vivo X&#8208;ray imaging and pressure sensing are demonstrated using a live rat. This multiplexed platform has high spatial resolution and good flexibility, thereby providing highly accurate inspection and diagnoses even for the distorted images of nonplanar objects.

         <title>Recent Progress on Perovskite Surfaces and Interfaces in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports recent progress on perovskite surface and interface science of perovskite optoelectronic devices. The impact of various surface and interface defects on heterojunction energy barriers and carrier dynamics in devices is reviewed and discussed. Practical engineering methods to mitigate these defects at various interfaces in devices are summarized as well.








Abstract
Surfaces and heterojunction interfaces, where defects and energy levels dictate charge&#8208;carrier dynamics in optoelectronic devices, are critical for unlocking the full potential of perovskite semiconductors. In this progress report, chemical structures of perovskite surfaces are discussed and basic physical rules for the band alignment are summarized at various perovskite interfaces. Common perovskite surfaces are typically decorated by various compositional and structural defects such as residual surface reactants, discrete nanoclusters, reactions by products, vacancies, interstitials, antisites, etc. Some of these surface species induce deep&#8208;level defect states in the forbidden band forming very harmful charge&#8208;carrier traps and affect negatively the interface band alignments for achieving optimal device performance. Herein, an overview of research progresses on surface and interface engineering is provided to minimize deep&#8208;level defect states. The reviewed subjects include selection of interface and substrate buffer layers for growing better crystals, materials and processing methods for surface passivation, the surface catalyst for microstructure transformations, organic semiconductors for charge extraction or injection, heterojunctions with wide bandgap perovskites or nanocrystals for mitigating defects, and electrode interlayer for preventing interdiffusion and reactions. These surface and interface engineering strategies are shown to be critical in boosting device performance for both solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite for Hydrogen Sulfide Gas and Trimodal&#8208;Enhanced Enzyme Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed nanocomposite based on tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporated dendritic mesoporous organosilica as an effective cornerstone to load with chloroperoxidase (CPO) and sodium hyaluronate modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs) can release Ca2+, hydrogen peroxide, and CPO rapidly in tumor microenvironment and generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, H2S gas, tri&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic therapy, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined tumor therapy strategy has been established.








Abstract
Recently, enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) has drawn much attention as a new type of dynamic therapy. However, the selection of suitable nanocarriers to deliver chloroperoxidase (CPO) and enhancement of the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical factors for improving the efficiency of EDT. In this study, a rapidly decomposing nanocomposite is designed using tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporating dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) as a nanocarrier, followed by loading CPO and sodium&#8208;hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs). The nanocomposite can effectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for tumor therapy without any exogenous stimulus via trimodal&#8208;enhanced EDT, including DMOS&#8208;induced depletion of glutathione (GSH), H2O2 compensation from CaO2&#8208;HA NPs in mildly acidic TME, and oxidative stress caused by overloading of Ca2+. As tetra&#8208;sulfide bonds are sensitive to GSH, DMOS can generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas as a new kind of H2S gas nanoreactor. Additionally, the overloading of Ca2+ can cause tumor calcification to accelerate in vivo tumor necrosis and promote computed tomography imaging efficacy. Therefore, a novel H2S gas, EDT, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined therapy strategy is developed.

Therefore, a novel H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas, EDT, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-interference combined therapy strategy is developed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organic Non&#8208;Wettable Superhydrophobic Fullerite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubility and wettability of solids signify their interaction with liquids. The findings on fullerites&#8212;the only soluble form of pure carbon&#8212;are presented. It is demonstrated that solution&#8208;cast fullerite films developed from colloidal gels generate a non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic surface. They can be used directly in a plethora of practical applications requiring ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity and underwater photochemical applications.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in material science has been the development of non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films based on a single organic material, without the requirement of fluorination or silane treatment. Here, such films and coatings, which are developed using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70 nanocrystals, are described. It is illustrated that despite the high surface energy of these van der Waals molecular crystals their gelation can create films having self&#8208;affine fractal surfaces with multiscale roughness. Water droplets on resulting surfaces of fullerite films bead like a pearl resting in a Fakir state with contact angle exceeding 150&#176;. The films are extremely water repellent and non&#8208;wettable; when submerged in water they stay dry up to 3 h even at a water depth of two feet and exhibit the plastron effect. A series of experiments are presented to provide comprehensive inspection of water droplet dynamics on these films. These include rolling, bouncing, squeezing, freezing, melting, evaporating; along with acidic and alkaline tests. Non&#8208;wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (1O2) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Device Arrays for Multiplexed Sensing Platforms Using Transfer of Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a removable polymer film, transfer of perovskite arrays to planar or nonplanar surfaces is realized. The total thickness of the fabricated perovskite device is thin enough to form conformal contact on various surfaces with 3D geometries. This work provides the integration of perovskites on contact lenses and pressure sensors, achieving multiplexed sensing platforms for future electronics.








Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in perovskite materials, their 3D integration capability for next&#8208;generation electronic devices is limited owing to their inherent vulnerability to heat and moisture with degradation of their remarkable optoelectronic properties during fabrication processing. Herein, a facile method to transfer the patterns of perovskites to planar or nonplanar surfaces using a removable polymer is reported. After fabricating perovskite devices on this removable polymer film, the conformal attachment of this film on target surfaces can place the entire devices on various substrates by removing this sacrificial film. This transfer method enables the formation of a perovskite image sensor array on a soft contact lens, and in vivo tests using rabbits demonstrate its wearability. Furthermore, 3D heterogeneous integration of a perovskite photodetector array with an active&#8208;matrix array of pressure&#8208;sensitive silicon transistors using this transfer method demonstrates the formation of a multiplexed sensing platform detecting distributions of light and tactile pressure simultaneously.

         <title>Band Engineering of Dirac Semimetals Using Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge density wave (CDW) is proposed as a tool to engineer an idealized Dirac semimetal. The CDW gaps all bands at the Fermi level except the Dirac cone, which is protected by non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry. Antiferromagnetic compounds of GdSbxTe2&#8722;x&#8722;&#948; are designed and synthesized to test this proposed mechanism. Unusual transport behavior is discovered and points to a new regime.








Abstract
New developments in the field of topological matter are often driven by materials discovery, including novel topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, and Weyl semimetals. In the last few years, large efforts have been made to classify all known inorganic materials with respect to their topology. Unfortunately, a large number of topological materials suffer from non&#8208;ideal band structures. For example, topological bands are frequently convoluted with trivial ones, and band structure features of interest can appear far below the Fermi level. This leaves just a handful of materials that are intensively studied. Finding strategies to design new topological materials is a solution. Here, a new mechanism is introduced, which is based on charge density waves and non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry, to design an idealized Dirac semimetal. It is&#160;then shown experimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb0.46Te1.48 is a nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that most interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual transport behavior points to a thus far unknown regime, in which Dirac carriers with Fermi energy very close to the node seem to gradually localize in the presence of lattice and magnetic&#160;disorder.

         <title>Design and Mechanism of a Self&#8208;Powered and Disintegration&#8211;Reorganization&#8211;Regeneration Power Supply with Cold Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imitating the regeneration of the planarian, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperature and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C).








Abstract
Up to now, power supplies designed based on the electrochemical reaction principle have had&#160;unavoidable defects, in that a complete redox reaction must be formed inside the power supply to operate normally, which makes it unable to be reconstructed and regenerated. Hence, the design and interpretation of this self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply are generally considered to be almost insurmountable obstacles to haunt both experimenters and theorists. Herein, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized by the principle of ion&#8208;selective diffusion, which regenerates by radical polymerization. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperatures and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C). As a hypothetical model, a self&#8208;powered and deformable arch bridge with disintegration and reorganization is fabricated. In the future, this power supply is expected to be applied in prosthetic limbs, bionic skins, implantable power supplies, mobile phones, portable computers, wearable devices, etc. Moreover, with the improvement of the stability and discharge life, it could promote major revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent industrial automation, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent power systems, etc.

         <title>Functional Micro&#8208;/Nanomaterials for Multiplexed Biodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed detection has gradually occupied the main development trend in the field of biodetection due to its rich information, accurate results, and high efficiency. The challenges of multiplexed detection in three aspects of coding library, detection performance, and workflow are analyzed, and the strategies are provided from the perspective of functional micro&#8208;/nanomaterials.








Abstract
When analyzing biological phenomena and processes, multiplexed biodetection has many advantages over single&#8208;factor biodetection and is highly relevant to both human health issues and advancements in the life sciences. However, many key problems with current multiplexed biodetection strategies remain unresolved. Herein, the main issues are analyzed and summarized: 1)&#160;generating sufficient signal to label targets, 2) improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio to ensure total detection sensitivity, and 3) simplifying the detection process to reduce the time and labor costs of multiple target detection. Then, available solutions made possible by designing and controlling the properties of micro&#8208; and nanomaterials are introduced. The aim is to emphasize the role that micro&#8208;/nanomaterials can play in the improvement of multiplexed biodetection strategies. Through analyzing existing problems, introducing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments regarding relevant materials, and discussing future directions of the field, it is hopeful to help promote necessary developments in multiplexed biodetection and associated scientific research.

&lt;p&gt;When analyzing biological phenomena and processes, multiplexed biodetection has many advantages over single-factor biodetection and is highly relevant to both human health issues and advancements in the life sciences. However, many key problems with current multiplexed biodetection strategies remain unresolved. Herein, the main issues are analyzed and summarized: 1)&#160;generating sufficient signal to label targets, 2) improving the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure total detection sensitivity, and 3) simplifying the detection process to reduce the time and labor costs of multiple target detection. Then, available solutions made possible by designing and controlling the properties of micro- and nanomaterials are introduced. The aim is to emphasize the role that micro-/nanomaterials can play in the improvement of multiplexed biodetection strategies. Through analyzing existing problems, introducing state-of-the-art developments regarding relevant materials, and discussing future directions of the field, it is hopeful to help promote necessary developments in multiplexed biodetection and associated scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Dendrimer&#8208;Based Lipid Nanoparticles Enable Precise HDR&#8208;Mediated Gene Editing In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;viral, lipid nanoparticle (dLNP) delivery platform capable of co&#8208;encapsulating and delivering Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and an ssDNA template is developed for homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR)&#8208;mediated gene correction of DNA mutations in vivo. Relative ratios of lipids and nucleic acids are systematically optimized to induce high HDR efficiency, thereby guiding potential treatment opportunities for correction of mutations that cause disease.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) protein gene editing is poised to transform the treatment of genetic diseases. However, limited progress has been made toward precise editing of DNA via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR) that requires careful orchestration of complex steps. Herein, dendrimer&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (dLNPs) are engineered to co&#8208;encapsulate and deliver multiple components for in vivo HDR correction. BFP/GFP switchable HEK293 cells with a single Y66H amino acid mutation are employed to assess HDR&#8208;mediated gene editing following simultaneous, one&#8208;pot delivery of Cas9 mRNA, single&#8208;guide RNA, and donor DNA. Molar ratios of individual LNP components and weight ratios of the three nucleic acids are systematically optimized to increase HDR efficiency. Using flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and DNA sequencing to quantify editing, optimized 4A3&#8208;SC8 dLNPs edit &gt;91%&#160;of all cells with 56% HDR efficiency in vitro and &gt;20%&#160;HDR efficiency in xenograft tumors in vivo. Due to the all&#8208;in&#8208;one simplicity and high efficacy, the developed dLNPs offer a promising route toward the gene correction of disease&#8208;causing mutations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive AIEgens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE luminogens are one of the optimal choices for smart luminescent materials to be applied in real life and they have sparked much of the current interest in the smart materials area. Therefore, a myriad of AIE materials with diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been developed in recent years, and they exhibit broad application prospects.








Abstract
The unique advantages and the exciting application prospects of AIEgens have triggered booming developments in this area in recent years. Among them, stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens have received particular attention and impressive progress, and they have been demonstrated to show tremendous potential in many fields from physical chemistry to materials science and to biology and medicine. Here, the recent achievements of stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens in terms of seven most representative types of stimuli including force, light, polarity, temperature, electricity, ion, and pH, are summarized. Based on typical examples, it is illustrated how each type of systems realize the desired stimuli&#8208;responsive performance for various applications. The key work principles behind them are ultimately deciphered and figured out to offer new insights and guidelines for the design and engineering of the next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for more broad applications.

         <title>Customized Photothermal Therapy of Subcutaneous Orthotopic Cancer by Multichannel Luminescent Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to establish customized therapeutic prescriptions for photothermal ablation to orthotopic breast tumors. By utilizing a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoprobe, the parameters indicating individual intratumoral differences are analyzed through fluorescence imaging for constructing a 2D diagram of model prescriptions as the reference of actual treatments.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate&#8208;functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near&#8208;infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

         <title>Curvature Induced by Deflection in Thick Meta&#8208;Plates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of advanced functional devices often requires intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry. Here, thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures are used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures. A scaling relationship is presented to predict the deformation&#8208;induced curvature of thick plates and their micro&#8208;architectural design variables.








Abstract
The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures, including dome&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like shapes. Depending on the unit cell structure, non&#8208;auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e., negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It is found that bending such meta&#8208;plates along their longitudinal direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction. Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the geometry of the meta&#8208;plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is demonstrated by applying it to 3D&#8208;printed microscale meta&#8208;plates. Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal length and soft wearable robotics are presented.
