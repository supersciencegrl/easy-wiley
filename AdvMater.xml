         <title>Traceable Nano&#8208;Biohybrid Complexes by One&#8208;Step Synthesis as CRISPR&#8208;Chem Vectors for Neurodegenerative Diseases Synergistic Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes are established by one&#8208;step synthesis to serve as CRISPR&#8208;chem drug vectors (CF&#8208;TBIO). The CRISPR/Cas9 tool and the chemical drug are employed to inhibit and eliminate abnormal protein aggregations related to neurodegenerative diseases. CF&#8208;TBIO facilitates accumulation of gene&#8208;chem drugs in brain lesions, reduces the burden of protein aggregations, and provides accurate imaging signals, having great potential for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Abnormal protein aggregations are essential pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Eliminating while inhibiting the regeneration of these protein aggregates is considered an effective treatment strategy. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene&#8208;editing tool is employed to inhibit the regeneration of disease&#8208;related proteins, while chemical drugs are applied to eliminate the proteins that are produced. To efficiently deliver CRISPR&#8208;chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes (F&#8208;TBIO) are constructed by one&#8208;step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF&#8208;TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF&#8208;TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF&#8208;TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment. The finding shows that CF&#8208;TBIO has great potential to serve as a CRISPR&#8208;chem drug&#8208;delivery platform for neurodegenerative diseases therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered MXene/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction Ultraviolet Photodiodes with Superhigh Efficiency and Stable Current Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene/GaN self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodiode with superhigh peak external quantum efficiency (over 99%) is reported. It is found that two synergistic effects, the robust Schottky&#8208;junction&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field and the photoexcited hot carriers, contribute to the high&#8208;performance photodiode. The MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction can be easily fabricated into ultraviolet photodiode arrays with uniform and stable photocurrent outputs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;performance Ti3C2Tx MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH)&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) photodiode is reported. Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3C2Tx/GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self&#8208;powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W&#8722;1), a high specific detectivity (7.06 &#215; 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 &#181;s/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy&#8208;processing spray&#8208;deposition route for the fabrication of large&#8208;area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high&#8208;efficiency and self&#8208;powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy&#8208;saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.

         <title>Advanced Data Encryption &#8203;using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide and amorphous native defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition can drive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane random telegraph noise current signals that are more stable than those traditionally observed in transition metal oxides. The reason is that these defects are confined and completely surrounded by 2D layered and crystalline h&#8208;BN. This allows fabrication of high&#8208;performance true random number generators for advanced data encryption.








Abstract
Advanced data encryption requires the use of true random number generators (TRNGs) to produce unpredictable sequences of bits. TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2O3, are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224&#160;&#8722; 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s&#8722;1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one&#8208;time passwords, which is ideal for the internet&#8208;of&#8208;everything. The superior stability of the h&#8208;BN&#8208;based TRNG is related to the presence of few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h&#8208;BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.

         <title>Engineering of Microcage Carbon Nanotube Architectures with Decoupled Multimodal Porosity and Amplified Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;templating of 1D carbon nanostructures provide next&#8208;generation nanocarbon aerogels with unique microcage internal architectures and independently tuneable micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroporosities. The intricate aerogel microstructures are chemically modified with metal nanoparticles (Cu, Pd, Ru) through a structure&#8208;preserving sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition functionalization approach. The subsequent nanoparticle&#8208;decorated aerogels exhibit amplified catalytic performance, as well as solvent&#8208;induced shape&#8208;recovery behavior.








Abstract
New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo&#8208;monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through&#8208;volume functionalization of intricate, pre&#8208;designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure&#8211;function relationships are explored in a pharma&#8208;important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building&#8208;blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Surface Self&#8208;Organization for Nanoscale Polygonal Morphology on Germanium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy and single&#8208;step method to manipulate the morphology of circular nanoholes via ion beam irradiation is presented. Through nanoscale control over self&#8208;organization process dynamics on the (100) surface of germanium, polygonal structures such as squares, triangles, and hexagons are realized. Highly periodic and protruding nanoscale&#8208;polygons indicate potential applications toward hierarchical and 3D nanostructures for multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
The evolution of polygonal&#8208;shaped nanoholes on the (100) surface of germanium, aided by focused ion beam induced self&#8208;organization, is presented. The energetic beam of ions creates a viscous phase which, at a thermodynamical minimum, leads to surface self&#8208;organization. A directed viscous&#8208;flow along the predefined nanoholes provides well&#8208;ordered polygonal nanostructures, ranging from triangles to hexagons and octagons, as desired. The amorphization exhibiting a confined viscous&#8208;flow at the walls of nanoholes is attributed to the localized melting zones induced by site&#8208;specific thermal spikes during ion irradiation, as revealed by microscopy and molecular dynamics studies. This leads to a local self&#8208;organization in the vicinity of each circular nanohole via a viscous&#8208;fingering process at the nanoscale. Such controlled self&#8208;organization, with the help of a predefined scanning grid, transforms the circular holes into the desired polygonal shape. The present morphology manipulation promises to surmount the barriers concerning the size reduction efforts in the field of nanofabrication.

         <title>2D&#8208;Berry&#8208;Curvature&#8208;Driven Large Anomalous Hall Effect in Layered Topological Nodal&#8208;Line MnAlGe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>

A layered topological nodal&#8208;line magnet MnAlGe is reported. The material exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the unique 2D Berry curvature distribution. The search for new layered topological magnets and exploration of magnetism and topological properties are enabled by this work.








Abstract
Topological magnets comprising 2D magnetic layers with Curie temperatures (TC) exceeding room temperature are key for dissipationless quantum transport devices. However, the identification of a material with 2D ferromagnetic planes that exhibits an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;magnetization remains a challenge. This study reports a ferromagnetic, topological, nodal&#8208;line, and semimetal MnAlGe composed of square&#8208;net Mn layers that are separated by nonmagnetic Al&#8211;Ge spacers. The 2D ferromagnetic Mn layers exhibit an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization below TC&#160;&#8776;&#160;503&#160;K. Density functional calculations demonstrate that 2D arrays of Mn atoms control the electrical, magnetic, and therefore topological properties in MnAlGe. The unique 2D distribution of the Berry curvature resembles the 2D Fermi surface of the bands that form the topological nodal line near the Fermi energy. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of &#8776;700 S&#160;cm&#8211;1 is obtained at 2 K and related to this nodal&#8208;line&#8208;induced 2D Berry curvature distribution. The high transition temperature, large anisotropic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetism, and natural heterostructure&#8208;type atomic arrangements consisting of magnetic Mn and nonmagnetic Al/Ge elements render nodal&#8208;line MnAlGe one of the few, unique, and layered topological ferromagnets that have ever been observed.

         <title>Toward Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Electrodepositions by Regulating Sn&#8208;Crystal Textured Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface of a Zn&#8208;metal anode is reconstructed with Sn&#8208;crystal textures via a facile chemical displacement reaction. Such a Sn&#8208;textured surface not only endows a reduced Zn deposition energy barrier but also regulates the lateral growth of Zn crystals, which promotes dendrite&#8208;free electrodeposits and leads to the achievement of an extremely low voltage hysteresis of 20&#160;mV and prolonged cycling performance over 500 h.








Abstract
The propensity of Zn&#8208;metal anodes to form non&#8208;uniform or dendritic electrodeposits is bound up with the nature of the electrode surface. However, the effect of surface structure on the inherent nucleation and deposition of Zn is not yet well understood. Here, the surface structure of a Zn&#8208;metal anode is reconstructed with Sn&#8208;crystal textures via a facile chemical displacement reaction. Compared to the bare Zn, the high&#8208;affinity Zn binding sites of Sn afford lower deposition energy barrier, which promotes deposition kinetics. What is more, a Sn&#8208;textured surface with moderate Zn affinity but high average surface energy ensures a better wettability from the deposits, leading to the lateral growth of Zn crystals. The resultant Sn&#8208;textured Zn&#8208;metal anode exhibits an extremely low voltage hysteresis of 20&#160;mV and achieves a prolonged cycling stability over 500 h cycles without dendrite formation. This work provides new insights into the crystal&#8208;texture&#8208;dependent Zn electrodeposition process and offers direction for direct surface texturing to better stabilize Zn&#8208;metal anodes with improved reversibility.

         <dc:description>
A remarkable conversion kinetics&#8208;enhanced polysulfide mediator is proposed via in situ preparation of oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TinO2n&#8722;1 quantum dots (OV&#8211;TnQDs) distributed on a porous carbon nanosheet (PCN) using 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene as the starting material. The obtained OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN/S cathode exhibits an ultrastable and long&#8208;life Li+ storage at high current density, demonstrating its great potential for next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
The application of Li&#8211;S batteries has been hindered by the shuttling behavior and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Here an effective polysulfide immobilizer and catalytic promoter is developed by proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TinO2n&#8722;1 quantum dots (OV&#8211;TnQDs) decorated on porous carbon nanosheets (PCN), which are modulated using Ti3C2Tx MXene as starting materials. The TnQDs not only confine polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promote polysulfide conversion via redox&#8208;active catalysis. The introduction of oxygen vacancies further boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides by lowering the adsorption energy and shortening the bond lengths. The PCN provides a physical polysulfide confinement as well as a flexible substrate preventing OV&#8211;TnQDs from aggregation. Moreover, the two building blocks are conductive, thereby effectively improving the electron/charge transfer. Finally, the ultrasmall size of QDs along with the porous structure endows OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN with large specific surface area and pore volume, affording adequate space for S loading and volume expansion. Therefore, the OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN/S delivers a high S loading (79.1 wt%), good rate capability (672 mA h g&#8722;1 at 2 C), and excellent long&#8208;term cyclability (88% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C). It also exhibits good Li+ storage under high S&#8208;mass loading and lean electrolyte.

         <title>2D Honeycomb&#8208;Kagome Polymer Tandem as Effective Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem cells made of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type 2D&#8208;HT&#8208;polymers can be used for effective overall water splitting. Upon irradiation, the photon&#8208;generated holes and electrons of low mobility remain in the half&#8208;electrodes and provide sufficient drive potential to promote hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Mobile charges powered by the potential difference will enter the other half&#8208;electrode, resulting in effective electron/hole separation.








Abstract
On the basis of first&#8208;principles calculations, the potential of applying 2D honeycomb&#8208;kagome polymers made of heteroatom&#8208;centered triangulene derivatives to photocatalyze water splitting is explored. The designed 2D polymers possess indirect bandgaps in the range of 1.80&#8211;2.84&#160;eV and show pronounced light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region of the solar spectrum. With suitable band edge alignment, the examined N&#8208; and B&#8208;center polymers can generate sufficient photon&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The combination of lattice&#8208;inherent band features (flat bands) with chemical functionalization (potential shift due to heteroatoms) makes it possible to construct tandem cells with suppressed electron/hole recombination for effective overall water splitting. In addition, there is a potential difference between the half&#8208;electrodes that can be utlized to power&#8203; auxiliary components in self&#8208;sufficient photocatalyzers.

         <title>A Molecular Drone for Atomic&#8208;Scale Fabrication Working under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the enormous potential, atomic&#8208;scale technologies have been hindered by difficulties in processing. Surface atom complexation is exploited as a new paradigm for sub&#8208;nanometric fabrication. A coordination compound behaves as a &#8220;molecular drone&#8221;: it lands on to the surface, bonds to an atom, and then leaves the surface, thus creating an atomic vacancy stable under ambient condition.








Abstract
The direct manipulation of individual atoms has led to the advancement of exciting cutting&#8208;edge technologies in sub&#8208;nanometric fabrication, information storage and to the exploration of quantum technologies. Atom manipulation is currently performed by scanning probe microscopy (SPM), which enables an extraordinary spatial control, but provides a low throughput, requiring complex critical experimental conditions and advanced instrumentation. Here, a new paradigm is demonstrated for surface atom manipulation that overcomes the limitations of SPM techniques by replacing the SPM probe with a coordination compound that exploits surface atom complexation as a tool for atomic&#8208;scale fabrication. The coordination compound works as a &#8220;molecular drone&#8221;: it lands onto a substrate, bonds to a specific atom on the surface, picks it up, and then leaves the surface along with the extracted atom, thus creating an atomic vacancy in a specific position on the surface. Remarkably, the feasibility of the process is demonstrated under electrochemical control and the stability of the fabricated pattern at room temperature, under ambient conditions.

         <title>Orthogonal Images Concealed Within a Responsive 6&#8208;Dimensional Hypersurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for printing copolymer brush patterns is reported, where the composition across the array and along the polymer chain can be controlled precisely at each pixel. This advance is enabled by an approach that accelerates the understanding and optimization of reaction conditions on polymer growth. The power of this strategy is demonstrated by printing a copolymer brush pattern where, under illumination, one image appears, and a different image emerges upon heating.








Abstract
A photochemical printer, equipped with a digital micromirror device (DMD), leads to the rapid elucidation of the kinetics of the surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical photopolymerization of N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) monomers. This effort reveals conditions where polymer brushes of identical heights can be grown from each monomer. With these data, hidden images are created that appear upon heating the substrate above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of polyNIPAM. By introducing a third monomer, methacryloxyethyl thiocarbamoyl rhodamine B, a second, orthogonal image appears upon UV&#8208;irradiation. With these studies, it is shown how a new photochemical printer accelerates discovery, creates arbitrary patterns, and addresses long&#8208;standing problems in brush polymer and surface chemistry. With this technology in hand a new method is demonstrated to encrypt data within hypersurfaces.

         <title>Benzene Ring Knitting Achieved by Ambient&#8208;Temperature Dehalogenation via Mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;Type Reductive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of conjugated porous networks (CPN) is realized via straight&#8208;forward aromatic ring knitting derived from reductive dehalogenation of aromatic halides promoted by mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;type reactions in the presence of magnesium under neat and ambient conditions.








Abstract
The current approaches capable of affording conjugated porous networks (CPNs) still rely on solution&#8208;based coupling reactions promoted by noble metal complexes or Lewis acids, on&#8208;surface polymerization conducted in ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum environment at very high temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C), or mechanochemical Scholl&#8208;type reactions limited to electron&#8208;rich substrates. To develop simple and scalable approaches capable of making CPNs under neat and ambient conditions, herein, a novel and complementary method to the current oxidative Scholl coupling processes is demonstrated to afford CPNs via direct aromatic ring knitting promoted by mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;type reactions. The key to this strategy lies in the dehalogenation of aromatic halides in the presence of Mg involving the formation of Grignard reagent intermediates. Products (Ph&#8208;CPN&#8208;1) obtained via direct C&#63743;C bond formation between 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBB) monomer feature high surface areas together with mesoporous architecture. The versatility of this approach is confirmed by the successful construction of various CPNs via knitting of the corresponding aromatic rings (e.g., pyrene and triphenylene), and even highly crystalline graphite product&#160;was obtained. The CPNs exhibit good electrochemical performance as the anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This approach expands the frontiers of CPN synthesis and provides new opportunities to their scalable applications.

         <title>Templateless, Plating&#8208;Free Fabrication of Flexible Transparent Electrodes with Embedded Silver Mesh by Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Microscale 3D Printing and Hybrid Hot Embossing</title>

         <dc:description>
A maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication method for high&#8208;performance flexible transparent electrodes with embedded silver mesh is proposed by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven microscale 3D printing technique and a hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The flexible transparent electrode with embedded silver mesh exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, remarkable mechanical stability, and environmental adaptability.








Abstract
Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) with an embedded metal mesh are considered a promising alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) due to their excellent photoelectric performance, surface roughness, and mechanical and environmental stability. However, great challenges remain for achieving simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly manufacturing of high&#8208;performance FTEs with embedded metal mesh. Herein, a maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication technique is proposed for FTEs with embedded silver mesh by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven (EFD) microscale 3D printing technique and a newly developed hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The final fabricated FTE exhibits superior optoelectronic properties with a transmittance of 85.79%, a sheet resistance of 0.75 &#937; sq&#8722;1, a smooth surface of silver mesh (Ra&#160;&#8776; 18.8&#160;nm) without any polishing treatment, and remarkable mechanical stability and environmental adaptability with a negligible increase in sheet resistance under diverse cyclic tests and harsh working conditions (1000 bending cycles, 80 adhesion tests, 120 scratch tests, 100&#160;min ultrasonic test, and 72 h chemical attack). The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly process for high&#8208;performance FTE.

The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for high-performance FTE.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmed Size&#8208;Changeable Nanotheranostic Agents for Enhanced Imaging&#8208;Guided Chemo/Photodynamic Combination Therapy and Fast Elimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotheranostic agent, which can realize two&#8208;stage programmed size changes, is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. Once the nano&#8208;sized agents reach the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates will be formed for enhanced MRI. After their theranostic functionalities exhaust, large&#8208;sized aggregates will be transformed into monodisperse small&#8208;sized particles for fast elimination.








Abstract
An ideal nanotheranostic agent should be able to achieve efficient tumor accumulation, retention, and fast elimination after its theranostic functions exhausts. However, there is an irreconcilable contradiction on optimum sizes for effective tumor retention and fast elimination. Herein, a programmed size&#8208;changeable nanotheranostic agent based on polyprodrug&#8208;modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. The nano&#8208;sized theranostic agents with an initial diameter of about 90&#160;nm can accumulate in tumor tissue through passive targeting. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates of IONPs are formed, realizing enhanced tumor retention and MR signal enhancement. Under the guidance of MRI, light irradiation is applied to the tumor site for triggering the generation of reactive oxygen species and drug release. Moreover, after chemo/photodynamic combination therapy, the large&#8208;sized aggregates are re&#8208;dispersed into small&#8208;sized IONPs for fast elimination, reducing the risk of toxicity caused by long&#8208;term retention. Therefore, this study provides a promising size&#8208;changeable strategy for the development of nanotheranostic agents.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanofibrils Formed by Coassembly of Clinically Approved Drugs for Tumor Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular nanofibrils with photothermal immunomodulatory function are formed by coassembly of clinically approved peptide (thymopentin) and photosensitizer (indocyanine green), mainly associated with hydrogen bonds. The complementary effects of the rapid photothermal therapy of indocyanine green and the long&#8208;term immunomodulation of thymopentin can be integrated for suppressing the tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal malignancies, compromises the performance of traditional therapeutic regimens in the clinic because of stromal resistance to systemic drug delivery and poor prognosis caused by tumor metastasis. Therefore, a biocompatible therapeutic paradigm that can effectively inhibit pancreatic tumor growth while simultaneously eliminating tumor metastasis is urgently needed. Herein, supramolecular nanofibrils are fabricated through coassembly of clinically approved immunomodulatory thymopentin and near&#8208;infrared indocyanine green for localized photothermal immunotherapy of pancreatic tumors. The resulting long&#8208;range ordered fibrous nanodrugs show improved photophysical capabilities for fluorescence imaging and photothermal conversion and significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of antitumor immune cells. Hence, the integration of rapid photothermal therapy and moderate immunomodulation for inhibiting tumor growth and eliminating tumor metastasis is promising. The utilization of clinically approved molecules to construct nanodrugs administered via localized injection amplifies the complementary photothermal immunotherapeutic effects of the components, creating opportunities for clinical translation as a treatment for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electroluminescence from Narrowband Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) enantiomers are developed by combining the merits of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and MR&#8208;TADF. This is the first example of a highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that exhibits circularly polarized electroluminescence signal, narrowband emission, and TADF concurrently.








Abstract
Purely organic fluorescent materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency, narrowband emission, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain an unaddressed issue despite their promising applications in wide color gamut&#8208; and 3D&#8208;display. Herein, the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) effect induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emission are integrated with high color purity and luminous efficiency together. Two pairs of highly efficient green CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, namely, (R/S)&#8208;OBN&#8208;2CN&#8208;BN and (R/S)&#8208;OBN&#8208;4CN&#8208;BN, are developed. The enantiomer&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit pure green emission with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 30 and 33&#160;nm, high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 29.4% and 24.5%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.43 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.27 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and +4.60 &#215; 10&#8722;4/&#8722;4.76 &#215; 10&#8722;4, respectively. This is the first example of a highly efficient OLED that exhibits CPEL signal, narrowband emission, and TADF concurrently.

         <title>Strong Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Strained SrTiO3 Homoepitaxial Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity is achieved in strained SrTiO3 homoepitaxial films by introducing unprecedented Ti/O&#8208;deficient perovskite nanoregions. These nanoregions impose a large tensile strain on the matrix, leading to a large polar tetragonality (c/a&#160;= 1.038) and paraelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition. As a result, the polarization can rival classic ferroelectrics like BaTiO3, and the ferroelectricity can be maintained up to &#8776;1098 K.








Abstract
Although the discovery of exceptional ferroelectricity in paraelectrics offers great opportunities to enrich the diversity of the ferroelectric family and promote the development of novel functionalities, transformation of paraelectric phases into ferroelectric phases remains challenging. Herein, a method is presented for driving paraelectrics into ferroelectric states via the introduction of M/O&#8208;deficient (M for metal) perovskite nanoregions. Using this method, strong ferroelectricity, equivalent to that of classic ferroelectrics, is achieved in a prototype paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO3) homoepitaxial film embedded with Ti/O&#8208;deficient perovskite nanoregions. It is shown that these unique nanoregions impose large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tensile strain and electron&#8208;doping effects on the matrix to form a tetragonal structure (tetragonality = 1.038), driving the off&#8208;center movements of Ti and Sr atoms. This leads to a significant room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric polarization (maximum polarization = 41.6 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 and spontaneous polarization = 25.2 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.60 MV cm&#8722;1) with a high thermal stability (Tstable&#160;&#8776; 1098 K). The proposed approach can be applied to various paraelectrics for creating ferroelectricity and generating emergent physical properties, opening the door to a new realm of materials design.

         <title>Bioinspired Soft Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired soft microactuators (BSMAs) are designed with inspiration from the dermis of the sea cucumber and from plant tendrils, for simultaneous achievement of programmable actuation and high mechanical property contrast. Droplet microfluidics allows miniaturized, facile, and seamless fabrication of the BSMAs. Applications of the BSMAs as microlifters, reversible microgrippers, artificial tendrils, and microrobots for object manipulation/transportation in different and complex environments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Soft actuators have the potential of revolutionizing the field of robotics. However, it has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve simultaneously: i) miniaturization of soft actuators, ii) high contrast between materials properties at their &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; states, iii) significant actuation for high&#8208;payload mechanical work, and iv) ability to perform diverse shape transformations. This challenge is addressed by synergistically utilizing structural concepts found in the dermis of sea cucumbers and the tendrils of climbing plants, together with microfluidic fabrication to create diatomite&#8208;laden hygroscopically responsive fibers with a discontinuous ribbon of stiff, asymmetrically shaped, and hygroscopically inactive microparticles embedded inside. The microactuators can undergo various deformations and have very high property contrast ratios (20&#8211;850 for various mechanical characteristics of interest) between hydrated and dehydrated states. The resulting energy density, actuation strain, and actuation stress are shown to exceed those of natural muscle by &#8776;4, &gt;2, and &gt;30 times, respectively, and their weight&#8208;lifting ratio is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than the value of recent hygroscopic actuators. This work offers a new and general way to design and fabricate next&#8208;generation soft microactuators, and thus advances the field of soft robotics by tailoring the structure and properties of deformable elements to suit a desired application.

         <title>Fast X&#8208;ray Nanotomography with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Resolution as a Powerful Imaging Tool for Nanotechnology and Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optomechanical breakthroughs in X&#8208;ray nanotomography, leading to fast 3D tomographic acquisitions (85 min) with sub&#8208;10 nm spatial resolution, are reported. These new achievements are first validated by 3D characterizations of novel X&#8208;ray diffractive optics made by nanolithography and nanometer&#8208;thick film electrodes synthesized by atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputtering deposition methods on 3D silicon scaffolds for electrochemical energy storage applications.








Abstract
In the last decade, transmission X&#8208;ray microscopes (TXMs) have come into operation in most of the synchrotrons worldwide. They have proven to be outstanding tools for non&#8208;invasive ex and in situ 3D characterization of materials at the nanoscale across varying range of scientific applications. However, their spatial resolution has not improved in many years, while newly developed functional materials and microdevices with enhanced performances exhibit nanostructures always finer. Here, optomechanical breakthroughs leading to fast 3D tomographic acquisitions (85 min) with sub&#8208;10 nm spatial resolution, narrowing the gap between X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy, are reported. These new achievements are first validated with 3D characterizations of nanolithography objects corresponding to ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio hard X&#8208;ray zone plates. Then, this powerful technique is used to investigate the morphology and conformality of nanometer&#8208;thick film electrodes synthesized by atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputtering deposition methods on 3D silicon scaffolds for electrochemical energy storage&#160;applications.

         <title>Engineered Protein Photo&#8208;Thermal Hydrogels for Outstanding In Situ Tongue Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive protein hybrid hydrogel is fabricated by the complexation of genetically engineered anionic protein, chitosan, and Ag3AuS2 NP. With the properties of the large&#8208;scale production, low immunogenicity, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency, the hydrogel is promising to realize photothermal therapy for in situ tongue tumors.








Abstract
Surgical excision is the main choice for tongue cancer treatment. However, the physiological functions of oral and maxillofacial regions might be severely impaired and high risk of tongue tumor recurrence cannot be avoided. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for tongue cancer therapy. In this regard, a new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive and peritumoral injectable hydrogel is fabricated with extraordinary photothermal therapy (PTT) for in situ tongue tumors. The as&#8208;prepared soft material exhibits good biocompatibility and ultra&#8208;strong photothermal effect due to the formed network by negatively charged proteins, chitosan molecules, and Ag3AuS2 nanoparticles (NPs). In a well&#8208;constructed in situ tongue tumor model, tumors can be efficiently eradicated by one&#8208;time PTT treatment. Importantly, there are no side effects on surrounding normal tissues and potential tumor recurrence is inhibited. In stark contrast to traditional surgical excision, such biomaterials hold great potential for clinical treatment of oral cancers.

         <title>Large Fermi&#8208;Energy Shift and Suppression of Trivial Surface States in NbP Weyl Semimetal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials host both topological (TP) and trivial (TR) surface states in their band structure, the latter being undesired for topology&#8208;driven applications. A full suppression of trivial surface states is achieved by surface reconstruction of epitaxial NbP Weyl semimetal thin films. Moreover, large shifts of the chemical potential are induced by doping, enabling Fermi&#8208;level engineering of purely topological states.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals, a class of 3D topological materials, exhibit a unique electronic structure featuring linear band crossings and disjoint surface states (Fermi&#8208;arcs). While first demonstrations of topologically driven phenomena have been realized in bulk crystals, efficient routes to control the electronic structure have remained largely unexplored. Here, a dramatic modification of the electronic structure in epitaxially grown NbP Weyl semimetal thin films is reported, using in situ surface engineering and chemical doping strategies that do not alter the NbP lattice structure and symmetry, retaining its topological nature. Through the preparation of a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free, P&#8208;terminated surface which manifests in a surface reconstruction, all the well&#8208;known trivial surface states of NbP are fully suppressed, resulting in a purely topological Fermi&#8208;arc dispersion. In addition, a substantial Fermi&#8208;energy shift from &#8722;0.2&#160;to 0.3 eV&#160;across the Weyl points is achieved by&#160;surface&#160;chemical doping, unlocking access to the hitherto unexplored n&#8208;type region of the Weyl spectrum. These findings constitute a milestone toward surface&#8208;state and Fermi&#8208;level engineering of topological bands in Weyl semimetals, and, while&#160;there are still challenges in minimizing doping&#8208;driven disorder and grain boundary density in the films,&#160;they do represent a major advance to realize device heterostructures based on Weyl physics.

         <title>Realizing Colorful Holographic Mimicry by Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency colorful holographic device is reported. Dynamically tunable and wavelength&#8208;multiplexed functions of the device are realized by combining the idea of biological mimicry and the rich degrees of freedom in metasurfaces. The research findings may produce novel applications for optical information encryption, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and military camouflage.








Abstract
Mimicry is a biological camouflage phenomenon whereby an organism can change its shape and color to resemble another object. Herein, the idea of biological mimicry and rich degrees of freedom in metasurface designs are combined to realize holographic mimicry devices. A general mathematical method, called phase matrix transformation, to accomplish the holographic mimicry process is proposed. Based on this method, a dynamic metasurface hologram is designed, which shows an image of a &#8220;bird&#8221; in the air, and a distinct image of a &#8220;fish&#8221; when the environment is changed to oil. Furthermore, to make the mimicry behavior more generic, holographic mimicry operating at dual wavelengths is also designed and experimentally demonstrated. Moreover, the fully independent phase modulation realized by phase matrix transformation makes the working efficiency of the device relatively higher than the conventional multiwavelength holographic devices with off&#8208;axis illumination or interleaved subarrays.

     alt="Realizing Colorful Holographic Mimicry by Metasurfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-efficiency colorful holographic device is reported. Dynamically tunable and wavelength-multiplexed functions of the device are realized by combining the idea of biological mimicry and the rich degrees of freedom in metasurfaces. The research findings may produce novel applications for optical information encryption, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and military camouflage.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimicry is a biological camouflage phenomenon whereby an organism can change its shape and color to resemble another object. Herein, the idea of biological mimicry and rich degrees of freedom in metasurface designs are combined to realize holographic mimicry devices. A general mathematical method, called phase matrix transformation, to accomplish the holographic mimicry process is proposed. Based on this method, a dynamic metasurface hologram is designed, which shows an image of a &#8220;bird&#8221; in the air, and a distinct image of a &#8220;fish&#8221; when the environment is changed to oil. Furthermore, to make the mimicry behavior more generic, holographic mimicry operating at dual wavelengths is also designed and experimentally demonstrated. Moreover, the fully independent phase modulation realized by phase matrix transformation makes the working efficiency of the device relatively higher than the conventional multiwavelength holographic devices with off-axis illumination or interleaved subarrays. The work potentially opens a new research paradigm interfacing bionics with nanophotonics, which may produce novel applications for optical information encryption, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and military camouflage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Structural Healing of Encapsulated Perovskite Microcrystals for Improved Optical and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;sufficient  micrometer&#8208;level vacuum growth chamber is proposed for MAPbBr3 microcrystals to effectively prevent water and oxygen, and to greatly improve the thermal and optical stability by the reduction of deep level trap states.








Abstract
Perovskite materials and their optoelectronic devices have attracted intensive attentions in recent years. However, it is difficult to further improve the performance of perovskite devices due to the poor stability and the intrinsic deep level trap states (DLTS), which are caused by surface dangling bonds and grain boundaries. Herein, the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microcrystal is encapsulated by a dense Al2O3 layer to form a microenvironment. Through optical measurement, it is found that the structure of perovskite can be healed by itself even under high temperature and long&#8208;time laser illumination. The DLTS density decreases nearly an order of magnitude, which results in 4&#8211;14 times enhancement of light emission. The observation is ascribed to the micron&#8208;level environment, which serves as a self&#8208;sufficient high&#8208;vacuum growth chamber, where the components of the perovskite are completely retained when sublimated and the decomposed atoms can re&#8208;arrange after thermal treatment. The modified structure showing high thermal stability is able to maintain excellent optical and lasing stability up to 2 years. This discovery provides a new idea and perspective for improving the stability of perovskite and can be of practical interest for perovskite device application.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Preferred Crystal Plane for a Stable and Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stable and reversible Zn anode with surface preferred crystal plane via crystal orientation is reported, revealing the relationship between the surface structure and the interfacial reaction of the Zn anode. Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that a Zn anode with more (002) basal plane exposed exhibits free dendrites, no by&#8208;products and weak hydrogen evolution compared to the (100) one.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are largely restricted by the unsatisfactory performance of zinc (Zn) anodes, including their poor stability and irreversibility. In particular, the mechanism behind the electrochemical contrast caused by the surface crystal plane, which is a decisive factor of the electrochemical characteristics of the hostless Zn anode, is still relatively indistinct. Hence, new insight into a novel anode with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane is provided. The interfacial reaction and morphology evolution are revealed by theoretical analysis and post&#8208;mortem/operando experimental techniques, indicating that Zn anodes with more exposed (002) basal planes exhibit free dendrites, no by&#8208;products, and weak hydrogen evolution, in sharp contrast to the (100) plane. These features benefit the Zn (002) anode by enabling a long cyclic life of more than 500 h and a high average coulombic efficiency of 97.71% for symmetric batteries, along with delivering long cycling stability and reversibility with life spans of over 2000 cycles for full batteries. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance Zn anodes for large&#8208;scale energy storage and can potentially be applied to other metal anodes suffering from instability and irreversibility.

         <title>Giant Ferroelectric Resistance Switching Controlled by a Modulatory Terminal for Low&#8208;Power Neuromorphic In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric switching in the van der Waals ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is used to achieve a resistance&#8208;switching ratio of heterosynaptic memristors above 103. The &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 heterosynaptic memristors feature picojoule read&#8208;energy consumption. The simulation proves that both supervised and unsupervised learning manners can be implemented in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 neutral networks with high image&#8208;recognition accuracy. Moreover, these devices can also realize in&#8208;memory computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectrics have been demonstrated as excellent building blocks for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories, including memristors, which play critical roles in the hardware implementation of artificial synapses and in&#8208;memory computing. Here, it is reported that the emerging van der Waals ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 can be used to successfully implement heterosynaptic plasticity (a fundamental but rarely emulated synaptic form) and achieve a resistance&#8208;switching ratio of heterosynaptic memristors above 103, which is two orders of magnitude larger than that in other similar devices. The polarization change of ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 channel is responsible for the resistance switching at various paired terminals. The third terminal of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 memristors exhibits nonvolatile control over channel current at a picoampere level, endowing the devices with picojoule read&#8208;energy consumption to emulate the associative heterosynaptic learning. The simulation proves that both supervised and unsupervised learning manners can be implemented in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 neutral networks with high image recognition accuracy. Moreover, these heterosynaptic devices can naturally realize Boolean logic without an additional circuit component. The results suggest that van der Waals ferroelectrics hold great potential for applications in complex, energy&#8208;efficient, brain&#8208;inspired computing systems and logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory computers.

         <title>Encapsulated Perovskites: Self&#8208;Structural Healing of Encapsulated Perovskite Microcrystals for Improved Optical and Thermal Stability (Adv. Mater. 21/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;sufficient micrometer&#8208;level vacuum growth chamber based on encapsulated MAPbBr3 microcrystals is designed by Rui Chen, Zhipeng Wei, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2100466. Perovskite materials with enhanced environmental, thermal, and optical stability through the reduction of deep&#8208;level trap states due to self&#8208;structural healing are observed. This greatly improves the lasing performance and service cycle.

In article number 2006301, Satya N. Guin, Claudia Felser, and co&#8208;workers report a layered topological nodal&#8208;line magnet MnAlGe, which is composed of magnetic Mn square&#8208;net layers that are separated by nonmagnetic Al&#8211;Ge spacers. The material exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the unique 2D Berry  curvature distribution. From this work the search for new layered topological magnets and exploration of magnetism and topological properties are enabled.

A metallated phthalocyanine, designed by Massimiliano Cavallini and co&#8208;workers, as detailed in article number 2007150, behaves as a &#8220;molecular drone&#8221;: it lands on to the surface, bonds to a specific atom, and then leaves the surface, thus creating a stable atomic vacancy. The process occurs in water under electrochemical control.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale polygons are fundamental building blocks toward hierarchical and 3D nanostructures for multifunctional nanodevices. In article number 2008668, Mohammed Aslam, Jing Fu, Rakesh G. Mote, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a single&#8208;step process to manipulate the morphology of circular nanoholes via ion&#8208;beam irradiation. Through nanoscale control over the self&#8208;organization process dynamics on the surface of Ge, they realize highly periodic and protruding polygons.

         <title>25 Years of Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells: A Flexible and Stretchable Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For 25 years, the unique structural and operating properties of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have invited creative research exploration. A discussion of how the LEC became a robust and fault&#8208;tolerant platform for mechanically flexible and stretchable devices through the integration of new emissive and electrode materials is presented. Printing fabrication methods, vital for the commercialization of flexible LECs, are also discussed.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are simple electroluminescent devices comprising an emissive material containing mobile ions sandwiched between two electrodes. The operating mechanism of the LEC involves both ionic and electronic transport, distinguishing it from its more well&#8208;known cousin, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED). While OLEDs have become a leading player in commercial displays, LECs have flourished in academic research due to the simple device architecture and unique features of its operating mechanism, inviting exploration of new materials and fabrication strategies. These explorations have brought LECs to an exciting frontier in advanced optoelectronics: flexible and stretchable light&#8208;emitting devices. Flexible and stretchable LECs are discussed herein, presenting the LEC system as a robust and fault&#8208;tolerant development platform. The engineering of emissive composites is highlighted to control mechanical properties, and how the tolerance of LECs to electrode work function and roughness has enabled the incorporation of new electrode materials to achieve flexibility and stretchability. As part of this story, the solution processability of LECs has led to exciting demonstrations of flexible and printed LECs. An outlook is provided for LECs that builds on these strengths, potentially leading to flexible, stretchable, low&#8208;cost devices such as illuminated tags, smart packaging, flexible signage, and wearable illumination.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cells for Space Applications: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation space photovoltaic technology. Key space environments and specific requirements for space photovoltaics are outlined. Some recent advances in terms of performance evolution and mechanism exploration of perovskite films and devices under space extreme environments are summarized. Progress and challenges associated with space applications of PSCs are highlighted.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have aroused burgeoning interest in the field of photovoltaics owing to their versatile optoelectronic properties. The outstanding power conversion efficiency, high specific power (i.e., power to weight ratio), compatibility with flexible substrates, and excellent radiation resistance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) enable them to be a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation space photovoltaic technology. Nevertheless, compared with other practical space photovoltaics, such as silicon and III&#8208;V multi&#8208;junction compound solar cells, the research on PSCs for space applications is just in the infancy stage. Therefore, there are considerable interests in further strengthening relevant research from the perspective of both mechanism and technology. Consequently, the approaches used for and the consequences of PSCs for space applications are reviewed. This review provides an overview of recent progress in PSCs for space applications in terms of performance evolution and mechanism exploration of perovskite films and devices under space extreme environments.

         <title>Materials for Improving Immune Cell Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor immune cell therapy requires immune cells to be successfully transfected with biomolecules like oligonucleotides and proteins. The progress in immune cell transfection using emerging materials, including microfluidics, nanoparticles, and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanostructures is discussed, and their promise and drawbacks against conventional tools like viral vectors and electroporation are evaluated.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR&#8208;T) therapy holds great promise for preventing and treating deadly diseases such as cancer. However, it remains challenging to transfect and engineer primary immune cells for clinical cell manufacturing. Conventional tools using viral vectors and bulk electroporation suffer from low efficiency while posing risks like viral transgene integration and excessive biological perturbations. Emerging techniques using microfluidics, nanoparticles, and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanostructures can overcome these challenges, and on top of that, provide universal and high&#8208;throughput cargo delivery. Herein, the strengths and limitations of traditional and emerging materials for immune cell transfection, and commercial development of these tools, are discussed. To enhance the characterization of transfection techniques and uptake by the clinical community, a list of in vitro and in vivo assays to perform, along with relevant protocols, is recommended. The overall aim, herein, is to motivate the development of novel materials to meet rising demand in transfection for clinical CAR&#8208;T cell manufacturing.

         <title>Rheological Aspects of Cellulose Nanomaterials: Governing Factors and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 21, May 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior rheological properties (e.g., viscosity, yield stress, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, thixotropy, and viscoelasticity) of cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) have enabled them to be effective rheology modifiers. The dependence of CNM rheology on a wide spectrum of parameters and the application of CNMs as rheology modifiers in several emerging industrial sectors are systematically described.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs), mainly including nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), have attained enormous interest due to their sustainability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, nanoscale dimensions, large surface area, facile modification of surface chemistry, as well as unique optical, mechanical, and rheological performance. One of the most fascinating properties of CNMs is their aqueous suspension rheology, i.e., CNMs helping create viscous suspensions with the formation of percolation networks and chemical interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, and hydrophobic attraction). Under continuous shearing, CNMs in an aqueous suspension can align along the flow direction, producing shear&#8208;thinning behavior. At rest, CNM suspensions regain some of their initial structure immediately, allowing rapid recovery of rheological properties. These unique flow features enable CNMs to serve as rheological modifiers in a wide range of fluid&#8208;based applications. Herein, the dependence of the rheology of CNM suspensions on test protocols, CNM inherent properties, suspension environments, and postprocessing is systematically described. A critical overview of the recent progress on fluid applications of CNMs as rheology modifiers in some emerging industrial sectors is presented as well. Future perspectives in the field are outlined to guide further research and development in using CNMs as the next generation rheological modifiers.

         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms with the ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion exhibit great potential in the biomedical field. This review introduces the latest development in bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms, highlights their design and engineering strategies, and systematically outlines the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in biomedical applications. One closely combines the range of materials structures with their biomedical performance, aiming to provide insights for their design and construction in the future.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, with their unique ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion, have been widely applied in important fields such as sensing, energy harvesting, wastewater treatment, and catalysis. In recent years, advances in material synthesis and engineering have provided new opportunities for the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric performance. Bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials have attracted interdisciplinary research interest due to recent insights on the impact of piezoelectricity on biological systems and their versatile biomedical applications. This review therefore introduces the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms from a broad perspective and highlights their design and engineering strategies. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomedical applications in both biosensing and disease treatment will be systematically outlined. The relationships between the properties, structure, and biomedical performance of the bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials are examined to provide a deep understanding of the working mechanisms in a physiological environment. Finally, the development trends and challenges are discussed, with the aim to provide new insights for the design and construction of future bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Emerging of Heterostructure Materials in Energy Storage: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing heterostructures is an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of active materials due to the unique heterointerface structure and some unrevealed synergistic effects. Herein, an overview of the recent advancements in heterostructure materials in terms of enhanced mechanism, synthesis techniques, and electrochemical performance are summarized. Future development trends for design heterostructure electrodes are analyzed.








Abstract
With the ever&#8208;increasing adaption of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems and electric devices, the energy storage capability of batteries and supercapacitors has faced increased demand and challenges. The electrodes of these devices have experienced radical change with the introduction of nano&#8208;scale materials. As new generation materials, heterostructure materials have attracted increasing attention due to their unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, and thus, the ability to enhance the energy/power outputs as well as the lifespan of batteries. In this review, the recent progress in heterostructure from energy storage fields is summarized. Specifically, the fundamental natures of heterostructures, including charge redistribution, built&#8208;in electric field, and associated energy storage mechanisms, are summarized and discussed in detail. Furthermore, various synthesis routes for heterostructures in energy storage fields are roundly reviewed, and their advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. The superiorities and current achievements of heterostructure materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (Li&#8208;S batteries), supercapacitors, and other energy storage devices are discussed. Finally, the authors conclude with the current challenges and perspectives of the heterostructure materials for the fields of energy storage.

         <title>Nanoengineered Peptide&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Conductive Supramolecular Biomaterial for Cardiac Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo RGD containing peptide is shown to form self&#8208;healing and biocompatible hydrogels. Nanoengineering the network of the peptide hydrogel by polyaniline integration results in semiconductive composite hydrogel showing excellent antibacterial properties and DNA binding ability. The composite hydrogel further supports the growth of cardiac cells into functional synchronized monolayers thus highlighting its potential as an excellent supramolecular biomaterial.








Abstract
Owing to their dynamic nature and ordered architecture, supramolecular materials strikingly resemble organic components of living systems. Although short&#8208;peptide self&#8208;assembled nanostructured hydrogels are regarded as intriguing supramolecular materials for biotechnology, their application is often limited due to their low stability and considerable challenge of combining other desirable properties. Herein, a di&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;based hydrogelator containing the cell&#8208;adhesive Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self&#8208;healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity. Cardiac cells grown on the surface of the composite hydrogels form functional synchronized monolayers. Taken together, the combination of these attributes in a single hydrogel suggests it as an exceptional candidate for functional supramolecular biomaterial designed for electrogenic tissue engineering.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electronic Ground&#8208;State Charge Transfer in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amount of charge transfer between components of a van der Waals heterostructure to reach the electronic ground state can exhibit a strong temperature dependence. For a donor&#8211;bridge&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type heterostructure, the intra component electron&#8211;phonon coupling and the intercomponent electronic coupling result in a temperature&#8208;dependent density of states available for charge transfer.








Abstract
Electronic charge rearrangement between components of a heterostructure is the fundamental principle to reach the electronic ground state. It is acknowledged that the density of state distribution of the components governs the amount of charge transfer, but a notable dependence on temperature is not yet considered, particularly for weakly interacting systems. Here, it is experimentally observed that the amount of ground&#8208;state charge transfer in a van der Waals heterostructure formed by monolayer MoS2 sandwiched between graphite and a molecular electron acceptor layer increases by a factor of 3 when going from 7 K to room temperature. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure calculations of the full heterostructure that accounts for nuclear thermal fluctuations reveal intracomponent electron&#8211;phonon coupling and intercomponent electronic coupling as the key factors determining the amount of charge transfer. This conclusion is rationalized by a model applicable to multicomponent van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Strain Effects on Rashba Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling of 2D Hole Gases in GeSn/Ge Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D hole gas (2DHG) in GeSn/Ge heterostructures and the strongest Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) among group&#8208;IV materials are demonstrated. The SOC strength is controlled by modulating the 2DHG density via top gating, which enables effective spin manipulation for a spin logic device and fast quantum computing for spin qubits via SOC effects.








Abstract
A demonstration of 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures with a mobility as high as 20 000&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is given. Both the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall effect are observed, indicating high sample quality. The Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is investigated via magneto&#8208;transport. Further, a transition from weak localization to weak anti&#8208;localization is observed, which shows the tunability of the SOC strength by gating. The magneto&#8208;transport data are fitted to the Hikami&#8211;Larkin&#8211;Nagaoka formula. The phase&#8208;coherence and spin&#8208;relaxation times, as well as spin&#8208;splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the k&#8208;cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Electronic Modulation of Non&#8208;van der Waals 2D Electrocatalysts for Efficient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review of the progress on non&#8208;ven der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D electrocatalysts is presented. Specifically, strategies for engineering electronic structure of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc., are comprehensively summarized, along with the perspective for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The exploration of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion is important for green energy development. Owing to their high surface areas and unusual electronic structure, 2D electrocatalysts have attracted increasing interest. Among them, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D materials with numerous chemical bonds in all three dimensions and novel chemical and electronic properties beyond those of vdW 2D materials have been studied increasingly over the past decades. Herein, the progress of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is critically reviewed, with a special emphasis on electronic structure modulation. Strategies for heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, pore creation, alloying, and heterostructure engineering are analyzed for tuning electronic structures and achieving intrinsically enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Lastly, a roadmap for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is provided from material, mechanism, and performance viewpoints.

         <dc:description>
Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated thin&#8208;film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal&#8208;based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue&#8208;adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light&#8208;emitting device is powered by a standard near&#8208;field&#8208;communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (q&#160;&gt; 20). Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue&#8208;device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived Nanostructures as Multifaceted Electrodes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanostructures for multifaceted electrodes in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are presented in this review. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, polysulfides immobilization and conversion, and morphology&#8211;property correlations for MSBs applications are systematically discussed. The future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures are also summarized, which will provide experimental/theoretical guidance in developing fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are considered up&#8208;and&#8208;coming future&#8208;generation energy storage systems because of their prominent theoretical energy density. However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic&#8208;level reactive sites, the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF&#8208;derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs&#8217; nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed. It is believed that this progress review will provide significant experimental/theoretical guidance in designing and understanding the MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures as multifaceted electrodes, thus offering promising orientations for the future development of fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs in broad energy fields.

         <title>Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat&#8208;spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat&#8208;spiral nanofibers endow an electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water&#8208;droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.








Abstract
Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial&#8208;scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat&#8208;spiral&#8208;based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.

         <title>Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.








Abstract
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate&#8208;field&#8208;dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long&#8208;term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)&#8208;based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.

         <title>Digital Electrochemistry for On&#8208;Chip Heterogeneous Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel digital electrochemistry approach is proposed, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical reactions to deposit electroactive materials. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.








Abstract
Many modern electronic applications rely on functional units arranged in an active&#8208;matrix integrated on a single chip. The active&#8208;matrix allows numerous identical device pixels to be addressed within a single system. However, next&#8208;generation electronics requires heterogeneous integration of dissimilar devices, where sensors, actuators, and display pixels sense and interact with the local environment. Heterogeneous material integration allows the reduction of size, increase of functionality, and enhancement of performance; however, it is challenging since front&#8208;end fabrication technologies in microelectronics put extremely high demands on materials, fabrication protocols, and processing environments. To overcome the obstacle in heterogeneous material integration, digital electrochemistry is explored here, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical processes to deposit and address electroactive materials within the pixel array. More specifically, an amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. The digital electrochemistry procedure is studied in&#8208;depth by using polypyrrole (PPy) as a model material. Active&#8208;matrix&#8208;driven multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach for material integration. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <title>Recent Progress of Chiral Perovskites: Materials, Synthesis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites are considered a promising class of materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices, owing to their superiority in combining chirality and high dielectric constants, high optical&#8208;absorption coefficients, and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, physical properties, and applications of chiral perovskites are reviewed.








Abstract
Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion&#8208;symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power&#8208;conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.

         <title>Boosting the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity for D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Conjugated Microporous Polymers by Statistical Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A copolymer photocatalysts can be boosted through statistical copolymerization by varying the ratio of electron donor to acceptor, and an attractive hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 is obtained by a copolymer (10&#160;mg) with optimized polymer structure, which is also evidenced by a water&#8208;draining experiment.








Abstract
Recently, great progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of conjugated organic polymer photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. However, it is still challenging to develop an organic polymer photocatalyst with high photoconversion efficiency. Rational structure design of organic polymer photocatalysts holds the key point to realize high photocatalytic performance. Herein, a series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated organic copolymer photocatalysts is developed using statistical copolymerization by tuning the feed molar ratio of pyrene (donor) to dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide (acceptor) units. It reveals that the photocatalytic activity of the resulting copolymers is significantly dependent on the molar ratio of donor to acceptor, which efficiently changes the polymer structure and component. When the monomer feed ratio is 25:75, the random copolymer PyBS&#8208;3 of 10&#160;mg with Pt cocatalyst shows a high hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under UV/Vis light irradiation using ascorbic acid as the hole&#8208;scavenger, and an external quantum efficiency of 29.3% at 420&#160;nm, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of organic polymer photocatalysts. This work demonstrates that statistical copolymerization is an efficient strategy to optimize the polymer structure for improving the photocatalytic activity of conjugated organic polymer catalysts.

         <title>Advances in Application of Azobenzene as a Trigger in Biomedicine: Molecular Design and Spontaneous Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of numerous studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use.

Abstract
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of multiple studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use. In recent years, long&#8208;wavelength&#8208;responsive azobenzene has been developed. Matching the longer wavelength absorption and hypoxia&#8208;response characteristics of the azobenzene switch unit to the bio&#8208;optical window results in a large and effective stimulus response. In addition, azobenzene has been used as a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive connector via biological cleavage under appropriate stimulus conditions. This has resulted in on/off state switching of properties such as pharmacology and fluorescence activity. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of azobenzene as a trigger in biomedicine are summarized.

         <title>From Fundamental Understanding to Engineering Design of High&#8208;Performance Thick Electrodes for Scalable Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided and practical guidelines offered toward developing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing needs for renewable energy demand the pursuit of batteries with higher energy/power output. A thick electrode design is considered as a promising solution for high&#8208;energy batteries due to the minimized inactive material ratio at the device level. Most of the current research focuses on pushing the electrode thickness to a maximum limit; however, very few of them thoroughly analyze the effect of electrode thickness on cell&#8208;level energy densities as well as the balance between energy and power density. Here, a realistic assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided, such as active material fraction and electrode porosity, which affect the cell&#8208;level energy/power densities of lithium&#8211;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (Li&#8211;NMC622) and lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells as two model battery systems, is provided. Based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium batteries, key research targets are quantified to achieve 500&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1/800&#160;Wh L&#8211;1 cell&#8208;level energy densities and strategies are elaborated to simultaneously enhance energy/power output. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are highlighted toward realizing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Tuning Microbial Activity via Programmatic Alteration of Cell/Substrate Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concepts of inorganic substrate/microorganism biointerfaces that can serve as &#8220;smart&#8221; materials with desired reactions to external conditions are discussed. Understanding how such sophisticated structures may be formulated and various types of their responses is essential for the discovery of novel approaches in the areas of biosensing, bioelectronics, and biocompatible materials.








Abstract
A wide portfolio of advanced programmable materials and structures has been developed for biological applications in the last two decades. Particularly, due to their unique properties, semiconducting materials have been utilized in areas of biocomputing, implantable electronics, and healthcare. As a new concept of such programmable material design, biointerfaces based on inorganic semiconducting materials as substrates introduce unconventional paths for bioinformatics and biosensing. In particular, understanding how the properties of a substrate can alter microbial biofilm behavior enables researchers to better characterize and thus create programmable biointerfaces with necessary characteristics on demand. Herein, the current status of advanced microorganism&#8211;inorganic biointerfaces is summarized along with types of responses that can be observed in such hybrid systems. This work identifies promising inorganic material types along with target microorganisms that will be critical for future research on programmable biointerfacial structures.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Photodetectors: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the design principle for lead&#8208;free perovskites and the progress of typical lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed and discussed. The outlook for future research and applications then explored.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photodetectors which apply hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as powerful candidates for next&#8208;generation light sensing. Among them, lead&#8208;based ones are the most popular beyond doubt on account of their unique and superior optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, trade&#8208;off toward commercialization exists between nontoxicity and high performance, with the poor stability of lead&#8208;based perovskites, indicating that it is indispensable to substitute lead with nontoxic element meanwhile bringing about a comparable figure of merit of photodetectors and relatively long&#8208;term stability. Herein, recent advances in lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed, analyzing the principle while designing new materials and highlighting some remarkable progress, which are comparable, even superior, to lead&#8208;based photodetectors. Furthermore, their potential strategy in optical communication, image sensing, narrowband photodetection, etc., is examined and a perspective on developing new materials and photodetectors with superior properties for more practical applications is provided.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Binary Polarization in a Ferroelectric Nanowire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary switching hysteresis in a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is demonstrated by imposing an anisotropic bias field to a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) gate with a diameter of &#8776;250&#160;nm. As switching characteristics of the associated GNR field&#8208;effect transistor, the FNW hosts four polar states: vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out, which are complemented by Landau&#8211;Ginzburg theory modeling.








Abstract
The prediction and observation of supra&#8208;binary polarization in a ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) covered with a semicylindrical gate that provides an anisotropic electric field in the FNW are reported. There are gate&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven transitions between four polarization states in the FNW's cross&#8208;section, dubbed vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out. They are determined by the interplay between the spatial depolarization energy and the free energy induced by an anisotropic external electric field, in clear distinction from the conventional film&#8208;based binary ferroelectricity. When the FNW is mounted on a biased graphene nanoribbon (GNR), these transitions induce exotic current&#8211;voltage hysteresis in the FNW&#8211;GNR transistor. This discovery suggests new operating mechanisms of ferroelectric devices. In particular, it enables intrinsic quaternary&#8208;digit information manipulation in parallel to the bit manipulation employed in conventional data storage.

         <title>Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors Entering a New Development Stage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely summary of the fantastic achievements in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) is provided with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;efficiency OLET devices. Finally, a brief conclusion is also given with comments on the challenges and prospective future research directions in this field. All these suggest a new development stage for OLETs and their related application fields under the joint efforts of scientists from different fields.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are possibly the smallest integrated optoelectronic devices that combine the switching and amplification mechanisms of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and the electroluminescent characteristic of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Such a unique architecture of OLETs makes them ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation display technology and electrically pumped lasers for miniaturized photonic devices and circuits. However, the development of OLETs has been slow. Recently, some exciting progress has been made with breakthroughs in high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs, and fabrication of novel multifunctional OLETs. This recent slew of advances may represent the advent of a new development stage of OLETs and their related devices and circuits. In this paper, a detailed review of these fantastic advances is presented, with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;performance OLETs. Finally, a brief conclusion is provided with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives in this field.

         <title>Controlled Assembly of Plasmonic Nanoparticles: From Static to Dynamic Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial organization of plasmonic nanoparticles can dramatically affect their properties. Therefore, the control over the assembly structure offers an effective approach toward tunable and enhanced plasmonic properties. This review presents recent advances in the controlled assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles and their impact on the development of dynamic systems that are capable of programmable structural transformation to activate target properties.








Abstract
The spatial arrangement of plasmonic nanoparticles can dramatically affect their interaction with electromagnetic waves, which offers an effective approach to systematically control their optical properties and manifest new phenomena. To this end, significant efforts were made to develop methodologies by which the assembly structure of metal nanoparticles can be controlled with high precision. Herein, recent advances in bottom&#8208;up chemical strategies toward the well&#8208;controlled assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles, including multicomponent and multifunctional systems are reviewed. Further, it is discussed how the progress in this area has paved the way toward the construction of smart dynamic nanostructures capable of on&#8208;demand, reversible structural changes that alter their properties in a predictable and reproducible manner. Finally, this review provides insight into the challenges, future directions, and perspectives in the field of controlled plasmonic assemblies.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, the recent invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) allows for self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Research on in&#8208; and on&#8208;body TENGs applied for electrical stimulation therapeutics in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering is detailed.








Abstract
Current solutions developed for the purpose of in and on body (IOB) electrical stimulation (ES) lack autonomous qualities necessary for comfortable, practical, and self&#8208;dependent use. Consequently, recent focus has been placed on developing self&#8208;powered IOB therapeutic devices capable of generating therapeutic ES for human use. With the recent invention of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), harnessing passive human biomechanical energy to develop self&#8208;powered systems has allowed for the introduction of novel therapeutic ES solutions. TENGs are especially effective at providing ES for IOB therapeutic systems given their bioconformability, low cost, simple manufacturability, and self&#8208;powering capabilities. Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, TENG&#8208;induced ES holds promise to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic interventions. The aim here is to detail research on IOB TENG devices applied for ES&#8208;based therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering. Furthermore, considering TENG&#8208;produced ES can be measured for sensing applications, this technology is paving the way to provide a fully autonomous personalized healthcare system, capable of IOB energy generation, sensing, and therapeutic intervention. Considering these grounds, it seems highly relevant to review TENG&#8208;ES research and applications, as they could constitute the foundation and future of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Engineering the Deformability of Albumin&#8208;Stabilized Emulsions for Lymph&#8208;Node Vaccine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deformable albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsion with self&#8208;adaptive deformability, which can squeeze through the cellular gaps of lymphatic vessels for lymph nodes (LN) delivery (intercellular pathway), is engineered. Concurrently, they tend to also be internalized and drained to LN by the immunocytes (intracellular pathway). Through the dual LN&#8208;transfer, exploiting the deformability may offer an alternative way for efficient LN delivery and vaccinations.








Abstract
A major challenge in vaccine delivery is to achieve robust lymph&#8208;node (LN) accumulation, which can capitalize on concentrated immunocytes and cytokines in LNs to stimulate the onset and persistence of adaptive immune responses. Previous attempts at developing vaccine delivery systems have focused on the sizes, charges, or surface ligands but not on their deformability. In fact, the LN homing of antigen&#8208;presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self&#8208;adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN&#8208;targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.

     alt="Engineering the Deformability of Albumin-Stabilized Emulsions for Lymph-Node Vaccine Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deformable albumin-stabilized emulsion with self-adaptive deformability, which can squeeze through the cellular gaps of lymphatic vessels for lymph nodes (LN) delivery (intercellular pathway), is engineered. Concurrently, they tend to also be internalized and drained to LN by the immunocytes (intracellular pathway). Through the dual LN-transfer, exploiting the deformability may offer an alternative way for efficient LN delivery and vaccinations.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in vaccine delivery is to achieve robust lymph-node (LN) accumulation, which can capitalize on concentrated immunocytes and cytokines in LNs to stimulate the onset and persistence of adaptive immune responses. Previous attempts at developing vaccine delivery systems have focused on the sizes, charges, or surface ligands but not on their deformability. In fact, the LN homing of antigen-presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin-stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self-adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN-targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin-stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D Electrodes for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent remarkable advances of 3D electrodes for bioelectronics are discussed, with extra emphasis on various materials and fabrication processes for 3D electrode as well as biomedical applications, such as microelectrode arrays, neural recoding, and retinal prostheses.








Abstract
In recent studies related to bioelectronics, significant efforts have been made to form 3D electrodes to increase the effective surface area or to optimize the transfer of signals at tissue&#8211;electrode interfaces. Although bioelectronic devices with 2D and flat electrode structures have been used extensively for monitoring biological signals, these 2D planar electrodes have made it difficult to form biocompatible and uniform interfaces with nonplanar and soft biological systems (at the cellular or tissue levels). Especially, recent biomedical applications have been expanding rapidly toward 3D organoids and the deep tissues of living animals, and 3D bioelectrodes are getting significant attention because they can reach the deep regions of various 3D tissues. An overview of recent studies on 3D bioelectronic devices, such as the use of electrical stimulations and the recording of neural signals from biological subjects, is presented. Subsequently, the recent developments in materials and fabrication processing to 3D micro&#8208; and nanostructures are introduced, followed by broad applications of these 3D bioelectronic devices at various in vitro and in vivo conditions.

         <title>Structuring of Si into Multiple Scales by Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) is a versatile method for the facile fabrication of Si and other semiconductors into structures having widely different scales. In this review, recent advances in MaCE are introduced, with special emphasis on the macroscale structuring of Si and its applications to a variety of fields, such as microelectromechanical systems, microfluidics, and micro&#8208;total analysis systems.








Abstract
Structuring Si, ranging from nanoscale to macroscale feature dimensions, is essential for many applications. Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has been developed as a simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable method to produce structures across widely different dimensions. The process involves various parameters, such as catalyst, substrate doping type and level, crystallography, etchant formulation, and etch additives. Careful optimization of these parameters is the key to the successful fabrication of Si structures. In this review, recent additions to the MaCE process are presented after a brief introduction to the fundamental principles involved in MaCE. In particular, the bulk&#8208;scale structuring of Si by MaCE is summarized and critically discussed with application examples. Various approaches for effective mass transport schemes are introduced and discussed. Further, the fine control of etch directionality and uniformity, and the suppression of unwanted side etching are also discussed. Known application examples of Si macrostructures fabricated by MaCE, though limited thus far, are presented. There are significant opportunities for the application of macroscale Si structures in different fields, such as microfluidics, micro&#8208;total analysis systems, and microelectromechanical systems, etc. Thus more research is necessary on macroscale MaCE of Si and their applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Assembly, Optical Properties, and Sensing Applications of Plasmonic Gap Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogaps are key structural components in inducing and controlling strong electromagnetic field for the enhancement of optical signals, and could be useful for various applications including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing, and bioimaging. Recent advances in forming plasmonic gap nanostructures, theoretical understanding of their optical properties, and the use of these structures for various sensing applications are summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Plasmonic gap nanostructures (PGNs) have been extensively investigated mainly because of their strongly enhanced optical responses, which stem from the high intensity of the localized field in the nanogap. The recently developed methods for the preparation of versatile nanogap structures open new avenues for the exploration of unprecedented optical properties and development of sensing applications relying on the amplification of various optical signals. However, the reproducible and controlled preparation of highly uniform plasmonic nanogaps and the prediction, understanding, and control of their optical properties, especially for nanogaps in the nanometer or sub&#8208;nanometer range, remain challenging. This is because subtle changes in the nanogap significantly affect the plasmonic response and are of paramount importance to the desired optical performance and further applications. Here, recent advances in the synthesis, assembly, and fabrication strategies, prediction and control of optical properties, and sensing applications of PGNs are discussed, and perspectives toward addressing these challenging issues and the future research directions are presented.

         <title>Capturing Cytokines with Advanced Materials: A Potential Strategy to Tackle COVID&#8208;19 Cytokine Storm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology, emerging biomaterials hold great potential to provide better solutions for COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases. By reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytokine neutralization systems and highlighting the promising technology development, this work intends to spark further research and development activity in this critical research area.








Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has caused great impact on the global economy and people's daily life. In the clinic, most patients with COVID&#8208;19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection&#8208;induced cytokine release syndrome (the so&#8208;called &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID&#8208;19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose&#8208;limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody&#8208;based and broad&#8208;spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized. It is anticipated that this work will provide insights on the development of novel therapeutics toward efficacious management of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases.

         <title>A Monomaterial Nernst Thermopile with Hermaphroditic Legs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermopile is a key component of thermoelectric technology. The contact between P and N legs of a Seebeck thermopile is one issue hindering widespread usage of these devices. The anomalous Nernst effect of a topological magnet is used to build a monomaterial thermopile, where a tilted bicrystal becomes a hermaphroditic leg and extrinsic contacts are not required.








Abstract
A large transverse thermoelectric response, known as the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has been recently observed in several topological magnets. Building a thermopile employing this effect has been the subject of several recent propositions. Here, a thermopile is designed and built with an array of tilted adjacent crystals of Mn3Sn. The design employs a single material and replaces pairs of P and N thermocouples of the traditional design with hermaphroditic legs. The design exploits the large lag angle between the applied field and the magnetization, which is attributed to the interruption of magnetic octupoles at the edge of the xy&#8208;plane. Eliminating extrinsic contact between the legs will boost the efficiency, simplify the process, and pave the way for a new generation of&#160;thermopiles.

         <title>Directional Modulation of Exciton Emission Using Single Dielectric Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly miniaturized platform for the control of emission is explored based on individual subwavelength silicon nanospheres. Simultaneous modulation of the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is demonstrated with controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios. A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance.








Abstract
Coupling emitters with nanoresonators is an effective strategy to control light emission at the subwavelength scale with high efficiency. Low&#8208;loss dielectric nanoantennas hold particular promise for this purpose, owing to their strong Mie resonances. Herein, a highly miniaturized platform is explored for the control of emission based on individual subwavelength Si nanospheres (SiNSs) to modulate the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance. Controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios are experimentally validated in 532&#160;nm laser excitation and 635&#160;nm exciton emission from a monolayer WS2. Versatile light emission control is achieved for different emitters and excitation wavelengths, benefiting from the facile size control and isotropic shape of SiNSs. Simultaneous modulation of excitation and emission via a single SiNS at visible wavelengths significantly improves the efficiency and directionality of TMD exciton emission and leads to the potential of multifunctional integrated photonics. Overall, the work opens promising opportunities for nanophotonics and polaritonic systems, enabling efficient manipulation, enhancement, and reconfigurability of light&#8211;matter interactions.

         <title>Elucidation of Diffusivity of Hydrogen Isotopes in Flexible MOFs by Quasi&#8208;Elastic Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental observation of hydrogen isotope diffusion in flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) is demonstrated through quasielastic neutron scattering. Unlike rigid structures, the diffusion difference between the isotopes in the flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) system.








Abstract
Kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted H2:D2 separation in flexible porous materials is more effective than the currently used energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation and girdle&#8208;sulfide processes for isotope separation. It is believed that material flexibility results in a pore&#8208;breathing phenomenon under the influence of external stimuli, which helps in adjusting the pore size and gives rise to the optimum quantum&#8208;sieving phenomenon at each stage of gas separation. However, only a few studies have investigated kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted isotope separation using flexible porous materials. In addition, no reports are available on the microscopic observation of isotopic molecular transportation during the separation process under dynamic transition. Here, the experimental observation of a significantly faster diffusion of deuterium than hydrogen in a flexible pore structure, even at high temperatures, through quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering, is reported. Unlike rigid structures, the extracted diffusion dynamics of hydrogen isotopes within flexible frameworks show that the diffusion difference between the isotopes increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework system.

         <title>A Generalized Method for High&#8208;Speed Fluorination of Metal Oxides by Spark Plasma Sintering Yields Ta3O7F and TaO2F with High Photocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spark plasma sintering (SPS) allows the solid&#8208;state fluorination of Ta2O5 to TaO2F and Ta3O7F with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) on a minute scale, which reduces the preparation time compared to conventional chemistry by three orders of magnitude. The microstructure of SPS&#8208;prepared TaO2F and Ta3O7F leads to high photocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution from water, whereas TaO2F and Ta3O7F prepared by conventional chemistry are catalytically almost inactive.








Abstract
A general method to carry out the fluorination of metal oxides with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) waste by spark plasma sintering (SPS) on a minute scale with Teflon is reported. The potential of this new approach is highlighted by the following results. i) The tantalum oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are obtained from plastic scrap without using toxic or caustic chemicals for fluorination. ii) Short reaction times (minutes rather than days) reduce the process time the energy costs by almost three orders of magnitude. iii) The oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are produced in gram amounts of nanoparticles. Their synthesis can be upscaled to the kg range with industrial sintering equipment. iv) SPS processing changes the catalytic properties: while conventionally prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F show little catalytic activity, SPS&#8208;prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F exhibit high activity for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, reaching photoconversion efficiencies up to 24.7% and applied bias to photoconversion values of 0.86%. This study shows that the materials properties are dictated by the processing which poses new challenges to understand and predict the underlying factors.

         <title>Development of a Cancer Vaccine Using In Vivo Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Active Lymph Node Accumulation for Improved Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active lymph node (LN) accumulation system is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with azide groups, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated cargoes to LNs. When loading with antigens and adjuvants, the formulation elicits an enhanced immune response, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged survival of mice.

Due to their ability to elicit a potent immune reaction with low systemic toxicity, cancer vaccines represent a promising strategy for treating tumors. Considerable effort has been directed toward improving the in vivo efficacy of cancer vaccines, with direct lymph node (LN) targeting being the most promising approach. Here, a click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active LN accumulation system (ALAS) is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with an azide group, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated antigen and adjuvant to LNs. When loading with OVA257&#8211;264 peptide and poly(I:C), the formulation elicits an enhanced CD8+ T cell response in vivo, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged median survival of mice. Compared to treatment with DBCO&#8208;conjugated liposomes (DL)&#8208;Ag/Ad without the azide targeting, the percent survival of ALAS&#8208;vaccine&#8208;treated mice improves by 100% over 60 days. Altogether, the findings indicate that the novel ALAS approach is a powerful strategy to deliver vaccine components to LNs for enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>Ion Exchange Lithography: Localized Ion Exchange Reactions for Spatial Patterning of Perovskite Semiconductors and Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion exchange lithography (IEL) for integrating user&#8208;defined patterns of desirable chemical compositions in thin films is introduced. In IEL, a reactive nanoparticle &#8220;canvas&#8221; is locally converted by printing ion exchange &#8220;inks&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and versatility are demonstrated by printing, painting, and airbrushing inks to create perovskite semiconductors with tunable composition. The functional potential is explored by fabricating light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Patterning materials with different properties in a single film is a fundamental challenge and essential for the development of next&#8208;generation (opto)electronic functional components. This work introduces the concept of ion exchange lithography and demonstrates spatially controlled patterning of electrically insulating films and semiconductors with tunable optoelectronic properties. In ion exchange lithography, a reactive nanoparticle &#8220;canvas&#8221; is locally converted by printing ion exchange &#8220;inks.&#8221; To demonstrate the proof of principle, a canvas of insulating nanoporous lead carbonate is spatioselectively converted into semiconducting lead halide perovskites by contact printing an ion exchange precursor ink of methylammonium and formamidinium halides. By selecting the composition of the ink, the photoluminescence wavelength of the perovskite semiconductors is tunable over the entire visible spectrum. A broad palette of conversion inks can be applied on the reactive film by printing with customizable stamp designs, spray&#8208;painting with stencils, and painting with a brush to inscribe well&#8208;defined patterns with tunable optoelectronic properties in the same canvas. Moreover, the optoelectronic properties of the converted canvas are exploited to fabricate a green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED), demonstrating the functionality potential of ion exchange lithography.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Innate Immunity Activation by Mitochondrial DNA Oxidative Damage for Tumor&#8208;Specific Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is demonstrated, in which a nanocatalytic medicine, named MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ nanoparticles, is constructed to target mitochondria for causing oxidative damage to mtDNA, initiating the M1 polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophage to suppress the growth of tumor cells.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a key role in protecting the human body from tumors, which, unfortunately, is largely counteracted by their immune&#8208;suppression function. Such an immune suppression has been reported to be induced by the immunosuppressive microenvironment, including the exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Here, a novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on the nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is proposed. In detail, a nanocatalytic medicine, Fe2+&#8211;Ru2+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle named as MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ (MRF), is constructed to induce oxidative damage in the mtDNA of tumor cells. Such an oxidative mtDNA is able to escape from the tumor cells and acts as an immunogenic damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;pattern to M1&#8208;polarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in the reactivated immunoresponse of macrophages against cancer cells, and the subsequent inflammatory response of innate immunity. Most importantly, the treatment strategy based on regulating the innate immune response of TAMs not only stops the primary tumor progression, but also almost completely inhibits the growth of distant tumors in the periods of treatments.

         <title>Polymorph Engineering for Boosted Volumetric Na&#8208;Ion and Li&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the inherent high electronic conductivity of metallic tetragonal FeSe, a conducting additive&#8208;free (CA&#8208;free) electrode configuration is realized. The CA&#8208;free electrode demonstrates high volumetric and high initial Coulombic efficiency for sodium storage. The proposed design strategy is also expanded to a Li&#8208;storage system, which exhibits superior volumetric energy and power densities.








Abstract
To meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for advanced rechargeable batteries with light weight and compact size, much effort has been devoted to improving the volumetric capacity of electrodes. Herein, an effective strategy of polymorph engineering is proposed to boost the volumetric capacity of FeSe. Owing to the inherent metallic electronic conductivity of tetragonal&#8208;FeSe, a conductive additive&#8208;free electrode (hereafter denoted as CA&#8208;free) can be assembled with an enhanced sodium storage volumetric capacity of 1011 mAh cm&#8722;3, significantly higher than semiconducting hexagonal&#8208;FeSe. Impressively, the CA&#8208;free electrode can achieve an extremely high active material utilization of 96.7&#160;wt% and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96%, superior to most of the anodes for Na&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, the design methodology is branched out using tetragonal FeSe as the cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The CA&#8208;free tetragonal&#8208;FeSe electrode can achieve a high volumetric energy density of 1373&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and power density of 7200 W L&#8722;1, outperforming most metal chalcogenides. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by in situ XRD for both sodium and lithium systems. The proposed design strategy provides new insight and inspiration to aid in the ongoing quest for better electrode materials.

         <title>Massively Parallel Arrays of Size&#8208;Controlled Metallic Nanogaps with Gap&#8208;Widths Down to the Sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are essential elements of nanoscale devices, but the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods has hindered practical applications. This work describes a simple, scalable approach for fabricating size&#8208;controlled MNGs with gap&#8208;widths as small as 3 nm. Applications of the technique include the fabrication of large&#8208;area plasmonic substrates formed from hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps.








Abstract
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are fundamental components of nanoscale photonic and electronic devices. However, the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods with nanometric control over the gap&#8208;size has hindered practical applications. A patterning technique based on molecular self&#8208;assembly and physical peeling is reported here that allows the gap&#8208;width to be tuned from more than 30&#160;nm to less than 3&#160;nm. The ability of the technique to define sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm gaps between dissimilar metals permits the easy fabrication of molecular rectifiers, in which conductive molecules bridge metals with differing work functions. A method is further described for fabricating massively parallel nanogap arrays containing hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps, in which nanometric size control is maintained over large patterning areas of up to a square centimeter. The arrays exhibit strong plasmonic resonances under visible light illumination and act as high&#8208;performance substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, with high enhancement factors of up to 3 &#215; 108 relative to thin gold films. The methods described here extend the range of metallic nanostructures that can be fabricated over large areas, and are likely to find many applications in molecular electronics, plasmonics, and biosensing.

A method is further described for fabricating massively parallel nanogap arrays containing hundreds of millions of ring-shaped nanogaps, in which nanometric size control is maintained over large patterning areas of up to a square centimeter. The arrays exhibit strong plasmonic resonances under visible light illumination and act as high-performance substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, with high enhancement factors of up to 3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; relative to thin gold films. The methods described here extend the range of metallic nanostructures that can be fabricated over large areas, and are likely to find many applications in molecular electronics, plasmonics, and biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Durable and Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Soft Peripheral Neuroprosthetics for In Vivo Bidirectional Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft but durable fatigue&#8208;resistant neuroprosthetic device is proposed for peripheral nerve interfacing based on a self&#8208;recoverable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite can spontaneously recover its electrical conductivity even after repetitive degradations by severe mechanical deformation. The neuroprosthetics implanted on a rat sciatic nerve achieve stable bidirectional signaling for 5 weeks. Deep neural network analysis predicts the joint position of the rat precisely.








Abstract
Soft neuroprosthetics that monitor signals from sensory neurons and deliver motor information can potentially replace damaged nerves. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability of devices interfacing peripheral nerves is challenging, since dynamic mechanical deformations in peripheral nerves cause material degradation in devices. Here, a durable and fatigue&#8208;resistant soft neuroprosthetic device is reported for bidirectional signaling on peripheral nerves. The neuroprosthetic device is made of a nanocomposite of gold nanoshell (AuNS)&#8208;coated silver (Ag) flakes dispersed in a tough, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP). The dynamic self&#8208;healing property of the nanocomposite allows the percolation network of AuNS&#8208;coated flakes to rebuild after degradation. Therefore, its degraded electrical and mechanical performance by repetitive, irregular, and intense deformations at the device&#8211;nerve interface can be spontaneously self&#8208;recovered. When the device is implanted on a rat sciatic nerve, stable bidirectional signaling is obtained for over 5 weeks. Neural signals collected from a live walking rat using these neuroprosthetics are analyzed by a deep neural network to predict the joint position precisely. This result demonstrates that durable soft neuroprosthetics can facilitate collection and analysis of large&#8208;sized in vivo data for solving challenges in neurological disorders.

         <title>Single&#8208;Domain Multiferroic Array&#8208;Addressable Terfenol&#8208;D (SMArT) Micromagnets for Programmable Single&#8208;Cell Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terfenol&#8208;D micromagnets exhibit single magnetic domains on par with the size of a single cell &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. These single&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures allow programmable multiferroic modulation of micromagnetic fields to selectively capture and release single&#8208;cells. Smart programmable multiferroic materials lay the groundwork for large&#8208;scale automated single&#8208;cell sorting and enable a broad spectrum of biomedical engineering applications.








Abstract
Programming magnetic fields with microscale control can enable automation at the scale of single cells &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. Most magnetic materials provide a consistent magnetic field over time but the direction or field strength at the microscale is not easily modulated. However, magnetostrictive materials, when coupled with ferroelectric material (i.e., strain&#8208;mediated multiferroics), can undergo magnetization reorientation due to voltage&#8208;induced strain, promising refined control of magnetization at the micrometer&#8208;scale. This work demonstrates the largest single&#8208;domain microstructures (20&#160;&#181;m) of Terfenol&#8208;D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.92), a material that has the highest magnetostrictive strain of any known soft magnetoelastic material. These Terfenol&#8208;D microstructures enable controlled localization of magnetic beads with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Magnetically labeled cells are captured by the field gradients generated from the single&#8208;domain microstructures without an external magnetic field. The magnetic state on these microstructures is switched through voltage&#8208;induced strain, as a result of the strain&#8208;mediated converse magnetoelectric effect, to release individual cells using a multiferroic approach. These electronically addressable micromagnets pave the way for parallelized multiferroics&#8208;based single&#8208;cell sorting under digital control for biotechnology applications.

         <title>Tunable Sponge&#8208;Like Hierarchically Porous Hydrogels with Simultaneously Enhanced Diffusivity and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach is developed to produce hierarchically structured hydrogels with highly interconnected pores, resulting in unprecedented simultaneously enhanced mass transport and mechanical properties. This approach is applied to several polymer systems and is compatible with 3D printing. This universal technique should greatly benefit the fundamental study of co&#8208;nonsolvency and the development of functionalized porous materials with mitigated diffusion limits.








Abstract
Crosslinked polymers and gels are important in soft robotics, solar vapor generation, energy storage, drug delivery, catalysis, and biosensing. However, their attractive mass transport and volume&#8208;changing abilities are diffusion&#8208;limited, requiring miniaturization to avoid slow response. Typical approaches to improving diffusion in hydrogels sacrifice mechanical properties by increasing porosity or limit the total volumetric flux by directionally confining the pores. Despite tremendous efforts, simultaneous enhancement of diffusion and mechanical properties remains a long&#8208;standing challenge hindering broader practical applications of hydrogels. In this work, cononsolvency photopolymerization is developed as a universal approach to overcome this swelling&#8211;mechanical property trade&#8208;off. The as&#8208;synthesized poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel, as an exemplary system, presents a unique open porous network with continuous microchannels, leading to record&#8208;high volumetric (de)swelling speeds, almost an order of magnitude higher than reported previously. This swelling enhancement comes with a simultaneous improvement in Young's modulus and toughness over conventional hydrogels fabricated in pure solvents. The resulting fast mass transport enables in&#8208;air operation of the hydrogel via rapid water replenishment and ultrafast actuation. The method is compatible with 3D printing. The generalizability is demonstrated by extending the technique to poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylamide) and polyacrylamide hydrogels, non&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive polymer systems, validating the present hypothesis that cononsolvency is a generic phenomenon driven by competitive adsorption.

         <title>Interfacial Covalent Bonds Regulated Electron&#8208;Deficient 2D Black Phosphorus for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A black&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;based metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is developed by covalently bonding black phosphorus with graphitic carbon nitride. The interfacial P&#63743;N covalent bonds in the hybrid catalyst are highlighted to efficiently regulate the electron transfer from black phosphorus to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms.








Abstract
Developing resource&#8208;abundant and sustainable metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for the practical application of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). 2D black phosphorus (BP) with fully exposed atoms and active lone pair electrons can be promising for oxygen electrocatalysts, which, however, suffers from low catalytic activity and poor electrochemical stability. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst is demonstrated via covalently bonding BP nanosheets with graphitic carbon nitride (denoted BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c). The polarized P&#63743;N covalent bonds in BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c can efficiently regulate the electron transfer from BP to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms. Impressively, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c (overpotential of 350&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 90% retention after 10 h operation) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art among the reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts. Additionally, BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c exhibits a small half&#8208;wave overpotential of 390&#160;mV for oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first bifunctional BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free oxygen catalyst. Moreover, ZABs are assembled incorporating BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c cathodes, delivering a substantially higher peak power density (168.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) than the Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs (101.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The acquired insights into interfacial covalent bonds pave the way for the rational design of new and affordable metal&#8208;free catalysts.

Additionally, BP-CN-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; exhibits a small half-wave overpotential of 390&#160;mV for oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first bifunctional BP-based metal-free oxygen catalyst. Moreover, ZABs are assembled incorporating BP-CN-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; cathodes, delivering a substantially higher peak power density (168.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than the Pt/C+RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based ZABs (101.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The acquired insights into interfacial covalent bonds pave the way for the rational design of new and affordable metal-free catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D MXene&#8211;Molecular Hybrid Additive for High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors and Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>

Intercalation of Ti3C2Tx MXene with didecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) yields an additive for polymer transistors. Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB boosts simultaneously the hole and electron mobility of conjugated polymers. A counterbalancing doping is revealed, featuring DDAB's n&#8208;doping effect and Ti3C2Tx's electron&#8208;accepting capability. Based on this intercalation engineering, complementary logic gates are demonstrated with well&#8208;centered trip points.








Abstract
MXenes are highly conductive layered materials that are attracting a great interest for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronics, photonics, and energy applications.. Their non&#8208;covalent functionalization with ad hoc molecules enables the production of stable inks of 2D flakes to be processed in thin&#8208;films. Here, the formation of stable dispersions via the intercalation of Ti3C2Tx with didecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) yielding Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB, is demonstrated. Such functionalization modulates the properties of Ti3C2Tx, as evidenced by a 0.47&#160;eV decrease of the work function. It is also shown that DDAB is a powerful n&#8208;dopant capable of enhancing electron mobility in conjugated polymers and 2D materials. When Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB is blended with poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;co&#8208;selenophene) [(PDPP&#8211;Se)], a simultaneous increase by 170% and 152% of the hole and electron field&#8208;effect mobilities, respectively, is observed, compared to the neat conjugated polymer, with values reaching 2.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By exploiting the balanced ambipolar transport of the Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB/PDPP&#8211;Se hybrid, complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) logic gates are fabricated that display well&#8208;centered trip points and good noise margin (64.6% for inverter). The results demonstrate that intercalant engineering represents an efficient strategy to tune the electronic properties of Ti3C2Tx yielding functionalized MXenes for polymer transistors with unprecedented performances and functions.

         <title>Printable Off&#8211;On Thermoswitchable Fluorescent Materials for Programmable Thermally Controlled Full&#8208;Color Displays and Multiple Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) are achieved successfully. They benefit from thermoinduced &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; synergistic changes of the fluorophores and fluorescence modifier, as well as the corresponding F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are easy to prepare and have high fluorescence emission contrast, great reversibility, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. All of these features contribute to their potential in multiple advanced applications.








Abstract
Thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) have received special attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric responses to temperature. Conventional TFMs generally display unicolor with switching from one color to another, showing unprintable and unsatisfied performances. These limitations greatly hinder their development and expansion toward advanced applications. Herein, the superior integration of full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on switching mode, printability, and high performance to TFMs is achieved successfully. The success is due to a thermally induced synchronous &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; stimulus&#8211;response mode regulated by a self&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;change material; that is, synergistic changes of the molecular existence states and subsequent colors/spectra of the fluorescent modifier and fluorophores, accompanied by corresponding high&#8208;efficiency on&#8211;off switching of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are simple to prepare and show good performance, such as high fluorescence emission contrast (&gt;100), great reversibility (&gt;200 cycles), and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. Particularly, these R/G/B TFMs can be prepared as tricolor fluorescent inks, and thus full&#8208;color emissions on flexible substrate can be easily obtained by printing. Finally, their great potential in switchable dynamic interior decoration, programmatic temperature&#8208;control information display, and senior information encryption are illustrated. This successful exploration offers a new perspective for designing and optimizing various other switchable materials with higher comprehensive performances.

         <title>Correlating Surface Crystal Orientation and Gas Kinetics in Perovskite Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;exchange kinetics in the perovskite oxide La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 are found to be strongly dependent on the exposed crystallographic surface. An all&#8208;perovksite, epitaxial half&#8208;cell is developed and characterized. The electrochemical performance of the different surface orientations is explained with insights from synchrotron&#8208;based ambient&#8208;pressure spectroscopy and density functional theory.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;gas interactions at electrode surfaces determine the efficiency of solid&#8208;oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers. Here, the correlation between surface&#8211;gas kinetics and the crystal orientation of perovskite electrodes is studied in the model system La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3. The gas&#8208;exchange kinetics are characterized by synthesizing epitaxial half&#8208;cell geometries where three single&#8208;variant surfaces are produced [i.e., La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3/La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.95Mg0.05O3&#8722;&#948;/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 (001), (110), and (111)]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrical conductivity relaxation measurements reveal a strong surface&#8208;orientation dependency of the gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, wherein (111)&#8208;oriented surfaces exhibit an activity &gt;3&#8208;times&#160;higher as compared to (001)&#8208;oriented surfaces. Oxygen partial pressure (pO2)&#8208;dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal that while the three surfaces have different gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, the reaction mechanisms and rate&#8208;limiting steps are the same (i.e., charge&#8208;transfer to the diatomic oxygen species). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the formation energy of vacancies and adsorption at the various surfaces is different and influenced by the surface polarity. Finally, synchrotron&#8208;based, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray spectroscopies reveal distinct electronic changes and surface chemistry among the different surface orientations. Taken together, thin&#8208;film epitaxy provides an efficient approach to control and understand the electrode reactivity ultimately demonstrating that the (111)&#8208;surface exhibits a high density of active surface sites which leads to higher activity.

         <title>Rapid Nitriding of Titanium Alloy with Fine Grains at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and tribological properties are important for titanium alloys, which are used as biomaterials. Inspiration is taken from the transfer of fine particles to achieve rapid nitriding without heating. The developed room&#8208;temperature methods result in the formation of a nitrided layer within a short period. The proposed method has the potential to improve various properties in other metallic materials.








Abstract
Multifunctional surfaces are required to design safe engineering products for human lives. Heating in a nitrogen atmosphere (nitriding) improves the tribological properties but reduces the strength of titanium (Ti) alloys owing to grain coarsening. A rapid nitriding method for Ti alloys forms the nitrided layer on the surface of a Ti alloy by bombarding with commercially pure Ti fine particles with a nitrided phase at room temperature within a short period. Furthermore, fine grains of Ti alloy are formed in the nitrided layer because of the impact of the Ti particles. These results reveal that this room&#8208;temperature method resolves the trade&#8208;off between the rapid formation of a nitrided layer and the suppression of grain coarsening for Ti alloys.

         <title>Widening the Range of Trackable Environmental and Health Pollutants for Li&#8208;Garnet&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8208;based electrochemical sensor, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide, are presented. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, reactions involved, and control over the interface sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures and phase stability provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants with fast response.








Abstract
Classic chemical sensors integrated in phones, vehicles, and industrial plants monitor the levels of humidity or carbonaceous/oxygen species to track environmental changes. Current projections for the next two decades indicate the strong need to increase the ability of sensors to sense a wider range of chemicals for future electronics not only to continue monitoring environmental changes but also to ensure the health and safety of humans. To achieve this goal, more chemical sensing principles and hardware must be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the specific electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based electrochemical sensor is provided, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide (SO2). This work extends the prime use of LLZO as a battery component as well as the range of trackable pollutants for potential future sensor&#8208;noses. Novel composite sensing&#8208;electrode designs using LLZO&#8208;based porous scaffolds are employed to define a high number of reaction sites, and successfully track SO2 at the dangerous levels of 0&#8211;10 ppm with close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical SO2 sensitivity. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, phase stability and sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants and toxins.

         <title>A Systematic Strategy of Combinational Blow for Overcoming Cascade Drug Resistance via NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hydrophobic photothermal conjugated polymer, DAP&#8208;F, is synthesized and utilized to prepare a combined nanoparticle system, F&#8211;Pt&#8208;nanoparticles (NPs), with a Pt(IV) prodrug. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser, shows potential for clinical translation in therapy of cancer via systematically overcoming the cascade drug resistance (CDR) of cisplatin.








Abstract
A systematic combination strategy is proposed for overcoming cisplatin resistance using near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered hyperthermia. A new photothermal polymer DAP&#8208;F is complexed with a reduction&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic polymer P1 to form F&#8208;NPs with photothermal effect. Subsequently, to build the final nanosystem F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs, F&#8208;NPs are combined with Pt&#8208;NPs, which are obtained by encapsulating a Pt(IV) prodrug with P1. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm NIR laser, have various effects such as: i) enhancing the cellular membrane permeability to promote the uptake of drugs; ii) activating cisplatin by accelerating the glutathione consumption; iii) increasing the Pt&#8208;DNA adducts formation and possibly the formation of a portion of irreparable Pt&#8208;DNA interstrand crosslinks, thereby inhibiting the repair of DNA. In vitro, it is found that even on cisplatin&#8208;resistant A549DDP cells, the IC50 of F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) is only 7.0 &#215; 10&#8722;6 m Pt mL&#8722;1. In vivo, on a patient&#8208;derived xenograft model of multidrug resistant lung cancer, the efficacy of the F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) treatment group shows a tumor inhibition rate of 94%. Taken together, here, an important perspective of resolving cascade drug resistance with the assistance of mild hyperthermia triggered by NIR light is presented, which can be of great significance for clinic translation.

In article number 2006651, Gregory P. Carman, Rob N. Candler, Dino Di Carlo, and co&#8208;workers develop a programmable multiferroic micromotor on par with the size of a single cell, &#8776;10 &#956;m. These electronically addressable motors enable single&#8208;cell manipulation based on time&#8208;dependent functions of individual cells, such as cell secretion. Smart programmable multiferroic materials lay the groundwork for large&#8208;scale automated single&#8208;cell sorting and enable a broad spectrum of biotechnology applications.

         <title>Recent Development of Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers requires a fundamental understanding of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, which is the primary focus of this review. The water electrolyzer in alkaline and acid are compared; and the recent advances in OER mechanisms, the strategies for enhancing activity and stability of electrocatalysts, surface reconstruction, and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one of the most promising hydrogen production techniques. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure&#8211;activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based OER catalysts and the current progress of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one of the most promising hydrogen production techniques. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state-of-the-art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure&#8211;activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble-metal-based OER catalysts and the current progress of non-noble-metal-based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insights on Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries from Lab Research to Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insight from lab research to commercialization for flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries is provided by comprehensively reviewing the development of polymer electrolytes, relevant challenges and strategies, and device configurations. Aiming to quantify the feasibility for commercialization, a ranking index is proposed combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward commercialization.








Abstract
Owing to the development of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), flexible ZIBs are deemed as potential candidates to power wearable electronics. ZIBs with solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes can not only maintain additional load&#8208;bearing properties, but exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties by preventing dendrite formation and inhibiting cathode dissolution. Substantial efforts have been applied to polymer electrolytes by developing solid polymer electrolytes, hydrogel polymer electrolytes, and hybrid polymer electrolytes; however, the research of polymer electrolytes for ZIBs is still immature. Herein, the recent progress in polymer electrolytes is summarized by category for flexible ZIBs, especially hydrogel electrolytes, including their synthesis and characterization. Aiming to provide an insight from lab research to commercialization, the relevant challenges, device configurations, and life cycle analysis are consolidated. As flexible batteries, the majority of polymer electrolytes exploited so far only emphasizes the electrochemical performance but the mechanical behavior and interactions with the electrode materials have hardly been considered. Hence, strategies of combining softness and strength and the integration with electrodes are discussed for flexible ZIBs. A ranking index, combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties, is introduced. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward the commercialization of flexible ZIBs.

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Techniques for Printing of Functional Inks for Flexible Physical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of droplet&#8208;based printing techniques, namely inkjet, aerosol jet, and E&#8208;jet, are reviewed in depth. Furthermore, other important aspects of printed electronics such as functional inks, sintering methods, and flexible substrates are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques, and main challenges toward printed electronics are also reviewed.








Abstract
Printed electronics (PE) is an emerging technology that uses functional inks to print electrical components and circuits on variety of substrates. This technology has opened up new possibilities to fabricate flexible, bendable, and form&#8208;fitting devices at low&#8208;cost and fast speed. There are different printing technologies in use, among which droplet&#8208;based techniques are of great interest as they provide the possibility of printing computer&#8208;controlled design patterns with high resolution, and greater production flexibility. Nanomaterial inks form the heart of this technology, enabling different functionalities. To this end, intensive research has been carried out on formulating inks with conductive, semiconductive, magnetic, piezoresistive, and piezoelectric properties. Here, a detailed landscape view on different droplet&#8208;based printing technologies (inkjet, aerosol jet, and electrohydrodynamic jet) is provided, with comprehensive discussion on their working principals. This is followed by a detailed research overview of different functional inks (metal, carbon, polymer, and ceramic). Different sintering methods and common substrates being used in printed electronics are also discussed, followed by an in&#8208;depth review of different physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques. Finally, the challenges facing the field are considered and a perspective on possible ways to overcome them is provided.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 20, May 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction are comprehensively reviewed. The basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are proposed.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) with high efficiency and nonpollution characteristics have attracted massive attention from both academic and industrial communities due to their irreplaceable roles in building the future sustainable energy system. However, the stability issue of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a central constraint to the widespread deployment of the devices relative to the catalytic activity. This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into how to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for ORR. First, the basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation, including the fundamental understandings of carbon corrosion, catalyst dissolution, and particle sintering, is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, the design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are summarized. Finally, further insights into the remaining challenges and future research directions are also provided.

         <title>Quicker and More Zn2+ Storage Predominantly from the Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificially constructed VOx sub&#8208;nanometer clusters/rGO composite composed of heterogeneous V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is used as zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode, in which Zn2+ storage predominantly originates from the interface while electron conduction occurs on the rGO. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage enables an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their low cost and high&#8208;level safety.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are highly desirable for large-scale energy storage because of their low cost and high-level safety. However, achieving high energy and high power densities simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a VO&lt;i&gt;

Further, this interface-dominated storage triggers decoupled transport of electrons/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and the reversible destruction/reconstruction allows the interface to store more ions than the bulk.

         <title>Efficient and Tunable Reflection of Phonon Polaritons at Built&#8208;In Intercalation Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation&#8208;dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation&#8208;independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built&#8208;in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in polar van der Waals crystals offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale due to their anisotropic and ultralow&#8208;loss propagation. While their analog plasmon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to electron oscillations&#8212;have long been studied and exhibit interesting reflections at geometrical edges and electronic boundaries, whether phonon polaritons can be reflected by such barriers has been elusive. Here, the effective and tunable reflection of phonon polaritons at embedded interfaces formed in hydrogen&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes is elaborated upon. Without breaking geometrical continuity, such intercalation interfaces can reflect phonon polaritons with low losses, yielding the distinct phase changes of &#8722;0.8&#960; and &#8722;0.3&#960; associated with polariton propagation, high efficiency of 50%, and potential electrical tunability. The results point to a new approach to construct on&#8208;demand polariton reflectors, phase modulators, and retarders, which may be transplanted into building future polaritonic circuits using van der Waals crystals.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and UV&#8208;Curable Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers for Digital Light Processing Based 4D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable shape&#8208;memory polymer (SMP) system can be stretched by to 1240% of its original length and is compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution 3D printing technology (up to 2&#160;&#181;m). The high deformability and fatigue resistance (more than 10&#160;000 cycles loading&#8211;unloading) make the SMP an ideal 4D printing material for engineering applications.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging fabrication technology that enables 3D printed structures to change configuration over &#8220;time&#8221; in response to an environmental stimulus. Compared with other soft active materials used for 4D printing, shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) have higher stiffness, and are compatible with various 3D printing technologies. Among them, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable SMPs are compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate SMP&#8208;based structures with complex geometry and high&#8208;resolution. However, UV&#8208;curable SMPs have limitations in terms of mechanical performance, which significantly constrains their application ranges. Here, a mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMP system is reported, which is highly deformable, fatigue resistant, and compatible with DLP&#8208;based 3D printing, to fabricate high&#8208;resolution (up to 2&#160;&#181;m), highly complex 3D structures that exhibit large shape change (up to 1240%) upon heating. More importantly, the developed SMP system exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and can be repeatedly loaded more than 10&#160;000 times. The development of the mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMPs significantly improves the mechanical performance of the SMP&#8208;based 4D printing structures, which allows them to be applied to engineering applications such as aerospace, smart furniture, and soft robots.

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrimer&#8211;Peptide Conjugates for Early Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Inflammatory Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;target nanoconjugate is developed to target the Alzheimer's disease microenvironment in the early stage. Synergistic therapeutic effects are achieved by scavenging reactive oxygen species, restoring cellular antioxidant capacity, polarizing microglia phenotype, inhibiting formation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid plaques, and recovering immunologic function based on the functional polymers and nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 activating peptide. Cognitive functions are enhanced in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model transgenic mice after treatment.








Abstract
Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments mainly focus on &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) targeting. However, such therapeutic strategies have limited clinical outcomes due to the chronic and irreversible impairment of the nervous system in the late stage of AD. Recently, inflammatory responses, manifested in oxidative stress and glial cell activation, have been reported as hallmarks in the early stages of AD. Based on the crosstalk between inflammatory response and brain cells, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive dendrimer&#8211;peptide conjugate (APBP) is devised to target the AD microenvironment and inhibit inflammatory responses at an early stage. With the modification of the targeting peptide, this nanoconjugate can efficiently deliver peptides to the infected regions and restore the antioxidant ability of neurons by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, this multi&#8208;target strategy exhibits a synergistic function of ROS scavenging, promoting A&#946; phagocytosis, and normalizing the glial cell phenotype. As a result, the nanoconjugate can reduce ROS level, decrease A&#946; burden, alleviate glial cell activation, and eventually enhance cognitive functions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice. These results indicate that APBP can be a promising candidate for the multi&#8208;target treatment of AD.

         <title>Dense All&#8208;Electrochem&#8208;Active Electrodes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of cathodes with superior ionic/electronic conductivities is demonstrated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. No carbon and electrolyte additives are needed in such an &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) cathode so the space and mass of the electrode are fully utilized and high mass/volume energy density are obtained.








Abstract
The energy density presents the core competitiveness of lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. In conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&lt;84 wt% and &lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non&#8208;electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic&#8208;conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic&#8208;conductive network self&#8208;supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)&#8208;based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&#8722;1 and 1945 W h L&#8722;1 at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.

In conventional Li-ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&amp;lt;84 wt% and &amp;lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non-electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all-electrochem-active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all-solid-state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic-conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic-conductive network self-supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)-based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1945 W h L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting Selective Nitrogen Reduction via Geometric Coordination Engineering on Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of W single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with N and O dual&#8208;coordination (W&#8208;oxygen and nitrogen coordination NO/NC) is prepared to achieve excellent electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. The unique electronic structures optimize the binding energy of NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the selectivity and activity of NRR. This opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.








Abstract
Atomic interface regulation that can efficiently optimize the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a worthwhile research topic. The challenge lies in deeply understanding the structure&#8211;properties correlation based on control of the coordination chemistry of individual atoms. Herein, a new kind of W SACs with oxygen and nitrogen coordination (W&#8208;NO/NC) and a high metal loading over 10 wt% is facilely prepared by introducing an oxygen&#8208;bridged [WO4] tetrahedron. The local structure and coordination environment of the W SACs are confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalyst shows excellent selectivity and activity for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculation reveals that unique electronic structures of the N and O dual&#8208;coordinated W sites optimize the binding energy of the NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the electrocatalytic NRR. This work opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.

         <title>Modulation of Negative Differential Resistance in Black Phosphorus Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of room&#8208;temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) is demonstrated in 2D ambipolar semiconductor transistors. The NDR device, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and occurs in the transistor saturation regime, exhibits a high current peak and superior gate and light tunability, opening new avenues for designing future electronics devices.








Abstract
Negative differential resistance (NDR), which describes the current decrease as the applied bias increases, holds great potential for varieties of electronic applications including radio&#8208;frequency oscillators, multipliers, and multivalue logics. Here, the modulation of a unique NDR effect in ambipolar black phosphorus (BP) transistors is reported, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and is distinct from conventional NDR devices that rely on quantum tunneling. The NDR device exhibits a high peak current density (34 &#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1) and a high operating temperature. More importantly, due to the strong coupling between the channel and the gate electrode, both the NDR peak current and peak/valley voltages can be effectively modulated by the electrostatic gate. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light can serve as an additional terminal for NDR modulation. The findings could provide an important insight into the transport behavior of BP transistors and contribute to the design of ambipolar&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based electrical circuits.

         <title>Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting mesostructured niobium carbonitrides with different morphologies are prepared from a single block copolymer via self&#8208;assembly using a variety of new synthetic routes. Superconducting transition temperatures are comparable to bulk analogues but vary with mesostructure, a typical fingerprint of metamaterials, while some materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches. The results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum metamaterials are expected to exhibit a variety of novel properties, but have been a major challenge to prepare as a result of the lack of appropriate synthetic routes to high&#8208;quality materials. Here, the discovery of synthesis routes to block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembly&#8208;directed niobium nitrides and carbonitrides is described. The resulting materials exhibit unusual structure retention even at temperatures as high as 1000 &#176;C and resulting critical temperature, Tc, values comparable to their bulk analogues. Applying the concepts of soft matter self&#8208;assembly, it is demonstrated that a series of four different BCP&#8208;directed mesostructured superconductors are accessible from a single triblock terpolymer. Resulting materials display a mesostructure&#8208;dependent Tc without substantial variation of the XRD&#8208;measured lattice parameters. Finally, field&#8208;dependent magnetization measurements of a sample with double&#8208;gyroid morphology show abrupt jumps comparable in overall behavior to flux avalanches. Results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.

10 &#956;m&#8208;thick high&#8208;strength solid polymer electrolytes with an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS are presented. They possess excellent interfacial stability with a lithium anode. The derived flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries, employing LiFePO4 or LiCoO2 as cathode materials, exhibit excellent cycling stability as well as high rate capability.








Abstract
An ultrathin solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) consisting of modified polyethylene (PE) as the host and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate and lithium salts as fillers is presented. The porous poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8211;polystyrene interface layers closely attached on both sides of the PE effectively improve the interface compatibility among electrolytes and electrodes. The resultant 10 &#956;m&#8208;thick SPEs possess an ultrahigh ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS at room temperature and excellent mechanical properties of 103.0&#160;MPa with elongation up to 142.3%. The Li//Li symmetric cell employing an optimized solid electrolyte can stably cycle more than 1500&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can stably cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C rate and with a capacity retention of 76.4% from 148.9 to 113.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C. The LiCoO2//Li pouch cell can stably operate at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;C rate for each 100 cycles. Furthermore, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can work stably after curling and folding, which proves its excellent flexibility and safety simultaneously. This work offers a promising strategy to realize ultrathinness, excellent compatibility, high strength, as well as safe solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

Moreover, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;//Li pouch cell can stably cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C rate and with a capacity retention of 76.4% from 148.9 to 113.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#160;&#176;C. The LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Li pouch cell can stably operate at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;C rate for each 100 cycles. Furthermore, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;//Li pouch cell can work stably after curling and folding, which proves its excellent flexibility and safety simultaneously. This work offers a promising strategy to realize ultrathinness, excellent compatibility, high strength, as well as safe solid electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dose&#8208;Independent Transfection of Hydrophobized Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike viral vectors that are capable of individual transfection, dynamically complexed cationic polymers/DNA nanoparticles (i.e., polyplexes) dissociate and thus lose transfection ability at reduced concentrations, causing in vivo transfection inefficiency once systemically administered. Optimizing the polymer hydrophobicity is shown to integrate the polyplexes upon dilution and enter cells via macropinocytosis, leading to virus&#8208;mimicking dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection.








Abstract
Cationic polymers dynamically complex DNA into complexes (polyplexes). So, upon dilution, polyplexes easily dissociate and lose transfection ability, limiting their in vivo systemic gene delivery. Herein, it is found that polyplex's stability and endocytosis pathway determine its transfection dose&#8208;dependence. The polyplexes of hydrophilic polycations have dose&#8208;dependent integrity and lysosome&#8208;trafficking endocytosis; at low doses, most of these polyplexes dissociate, and the remaining few are internalized and trapped in lysosomes, abolishing their transfection ability. In contrast, the polyplexes of the polycations with optimal hydrophobicity remain integrated even at low concentrations and enter cells via macropinocytosis directly into the cytosol evading lysosomes, so each polyplex can accomplish its infection process, leading to dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection like viral vectors. Furthermore, the tuned hydrophobicity balancing the affinity of anionic poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to the polyplex surface enables &#947;&#8208;PGA to stick on the polyplex surface as a shielding layer but peel off on the cell membrane to release the naked polyplexes for dose&#8208;independent transfection. These findings may provide guidelines for developing polyplexes that mimick a viral vector's dose&#8208;independent transfection for effective in vivo gene delivery.

         <title>Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D printed and disposable paper supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by a combination of nanocellulose, biopolymers, and carbon nanomaterials leading to monolithic integrated devices with excellent electrochemical properties. The results combining digital material assembly, high performance, and nontoxicity have the potential to move the field of sustainable electronics forward.








Abstract
With the development of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service&#8208;life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste). Fueled by the growing e&#8208;waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy&#8208;storage technologies such as lithium&#8208;ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F&#160;g&#8722;1 active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high&#8208;performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e&#8208;textiles, and healthcare.

         <title>Expansion Microscopy with Multifunctional Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of engineered multifunctional polymer dots enabling biomolecular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence is reported for expansion microcopy. The average brightness values of the polymer dots range from 3 to 6 times higher than those of commercial dyes. By combining sample expansion with super&#8208;resolution imaging, subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm can be resolved using conventional microscopes.








Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) provides nanoscale resolution on conventional microscopes via physically enlarging specimens with swellable polyelectrolyte gels. However, challenges involving fluorophore degradation and dilution during sample expansion have yet to be overcome. Herein, sequential cellular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence reported using multifunctional polymer dots (Pdots) designed for ExM applications are demonstrated. The impressive brightness of the Pdots facilitates multicolor ExM, thereby enabling visualization of a variety of subcellular structures and neuron synapses. The average fluorescence intensities of Pdots in ExM range from &#8776;3 to 6 times higher than those achieved using commercially available Alexa dyes. Moreover, the fluorescence brightness and optical fluctuation are significantly improved by a surfactant&#8208;containing expansion buffer, which enables further resolution enhancement via super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). The combination of ExM and SOFI allows subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm to be resolved by conventional microscopes. These results highlight the immense potential of multifunctional Pdots for ExM&#8208;enhanced super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Broadband Detection of X&#8208;ray, Ultraviolet, and Near&#8208;Infrared Photons using Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite&#8211;Lanthanide Nanotransducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for broadband photodetection of X&#8208;ray, ultraviolet, and near&#8208;infrared photons is proposed. A class of lanthanide&#8211;perovskite nanocrystals is developed by in situ crystallization of perovskite nanocrystals on the surface of mSiO2&#8208;coated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanocrystals. Such nanotransducers are further used to implement flexible X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 20 lp mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;halide perovskites hold great promise in developing next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance photodetectors. However, the weak absorption of perovskites beyond the near&#8208;infrared spectral region posts a stringent limitation on their use for broadband photodetectors. Here, the rational design and synthesis of an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8211;perovskite nanotransducer are presented, namely UCNPs@mSiO2@MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I), for broadband photon detection spanning from X&#8208;rays, UV, to NIR. It is demonstrated that, by in situ crystallization and deliberately tuning the material composition in the lanthanide core and perovskites, the nanotransducers allow for a high stability and show a wide linear response to X&#8208;rays of various dose rates, as well as UV/NIR photons of various power densities. The findings provide an opportunity to explore the next&#8208;generation broadband photodetectors in the field of high&#8208;quality imaging and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Correlated Magnetic Weyl Semimetal State in Strained Pr2Ir2O7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel correlated magnetic Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic renormalization is experimentally realized in the high&#8208;quality strained film of Pr2Ir2O7. Strain&#8208;induced all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to the magnetic Weyl semimetal state. Combing the experimental results and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization is reported, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions.








Abstract
Correlated topological phases (CTPs) with interplay between topology and electronic correlations have attracted tremendous interest in condensed matter physics. Therein, correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are rare in nature and, thus, have so far been less investigated experimentally. In particular, the experimental realization of the interacting WSM state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization has not been achieved yet. Here, experimental evidence of a correlated magnetic WSM state with logarithmic renormalization in strained pyrochlore iridate Pr2Ir2O7 (PIO) which is a paramagnetic Luttinger semimetal in bulk, is reported. Benefitting from epitaxial strain, &#8220;bulk&#8208;absent&#8221; all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering can be stabilized in PIO film, which breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to a magnetic WSM state. With further analysis of the experimental data and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl liquid state with logarithmically renormalized Fermi velocity, similar to that in graphene, is found, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions. This work highlights the interplay of strain, magnetism, and topology with electronic correlations, and paves the way for strain&#8208;engineering of CTPs in pyrochlore iridates.

&lt;p&gt;A novel correlated magnetic Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic renormalization is experimentally realized in the high-quality strained film of Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Strain-induced all-in&#8211;all-out antiferromagnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the magnetic Weyl semimetal state. Combing the experimental results and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization is reported, dressed by long-range Coulomb interactions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlated topological phases (CTPs) with interplay between topology and electronic correlations have attracted tremendous interest in condensed matter physics. Therein, correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are rare in nature and, thus, have so far been less investigated experimentally. In particular, the experimental realization of the interacting WSM state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization has not been achieved yet. Here, experimental evidence of a correlated magnetic WSM state with logarithmic renormalization in strained pyrochlore iridate Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (PIO) which is a paramagnetic Luttinger semimetal in bulk, is reported. Benefitting from epitaxial strain, &#8220;bulk-absent&#8221; all-in&#8211;all-out antiferromagnetic ordering can be stabilized in PIO film, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to a magnetic WSM state. With further analysis of the experimental data and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl liquid state with logarithmically renormalized Fermi velocity, similar to that in graphene, is found, dressed by long-range Coulomb interactions. This work highlights the interplay of strain, magnetism, and topology with electronic correlations, and paves the way for strain-engineering of CTPs in pyrochlore iridates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Divergent Paths, Same Goal: A Pair&#8208;Electrosynthesis Tactic for Cost&#8208;Efficient and Exclusive Formate Production by Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived 2D Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic for concurrent formate production is pioneeringly developed by coupling electrocatalytic methanol oxidation and CO2 reduction reactions, which can achieve highly efficient and selective value&#8208;added synthesis in both electrodes with lower energy consumption, using in situ metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of formic acid/formate is a promising alternative protocol to industrial processes. Herein, a pioneering pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for exclusively producing formate via coupling selectively electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which the electrode derived from Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheet arrays (Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af), as well as the Bi&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived ultrathin bismuthenes (Bi&#8208;enes), both obtained through an in situ electrochemical conversion process, are used as efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, achieving concurrent yielding of the same high&#8208;value product at both electrodes with greatly reduced energy input. The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af only needs quite low potentials to reach large current densities (e.g., 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2@1.345&#160;V)&#160;with &#8776;100% selectivity for anodic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Meanwhile, for CO2RR in the cathode, the as&#8208;prepared Bi&#8208;enes can simultaneously exhibit near&#8208;unity selectivity, large current densities, and good stability in a wide potential window toward formate production. Consequently, the coupled MOR//CO2RR system based on the distinctive MOF&#8208;derived catalysts displays excellent performance for pair&#8208;electrosynthesis of formate, delivering high current densities and nearly 100% selectivity for formate production in both the anode and the cathode. This work provides a novel way to design advanced MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts and innovative electrolytic systems for electrochemical production of value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Hydroplastic Micromolding of 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to mold 2D sheet microstructured materials based on hydroplasticity is described. An innovative interlayer&#8208;spacing&#8208;induced brittle&#8211;plastic transition in 2D materials is revealed. The approach enables direct forming with high design freedom and accuracy from 2D layered solids. The molded assemblies possess tunable electrical, optical, and other functional properties.








Abstract
Processing 2D sheets into desired structures with high precision is of great importance for fabrication and application of their assemblies. Solution processing of 2D sheets from dilute dispersions is a commonly used method but offers limited control over feature size precision owing to the extreme volume shrinkage. Plastic processing from the solid state is therefore a&#160;preferable approach to achieve high precision. However, plastic processing is intrinsically hampered by strong interlayer interactions of the 2D sheet solids. Here, a hydroplastic molding method to shape layered solids of 2D sheets with micrometer&#8208;scale precision under ambient conditions is reported. The dried 2D layered solids are plasticized by intercalated solvents, affording plastic near&#8208;solid compounds that enable local plastic deformation. Such an intercalated solvent&#8208;induced hydroplasticity is found in a broad family of 2D materials, for example graphene, MoS2, and MXene. The hydroplastic molding enables fabrication of complex spatial structures (knurling, origami) and microimprinted tubular structures down to diameters of 390&#160;nm with good fidelity. The method enhances the structural accuracy and enriches the structural diversity of 2D macroassemblies, thus providing a feasible strategy to tune their electrical, optical, and other functional properties.

         <title>Covalently Crosslinked Hydrogels via Step&#8208;Growth Reactions: Crosslinking Chemistries, Polymers, and Clinical Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various polymers and crosslinking chemistries are utilized for fabricating hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is challenging and time&#8208;consuming. The key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing hydrogels are outlined and their performance in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers summarized.








Abstract
Hydrogels are an important class of biomaterials with the unique property of high&#8208;water content in a crosslinked polymer network. In particular, chemically crosslinked hydrogels have made a great clinical impact in past years because of their desirable mechanical properties and tunability of structural and chemical properties. Various polymers and step&#8208;growth crosslinking chemistries are harnessed for fabricating such covalently crosslinked hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is time&#8208;consuming and challenging. It requires the integration of polymer chemistry knowledge with thoughtful crosslinking reaction design. This task becomes even more challenging when other factors such as the biological mechanisms of the pathology, practical administration routes, and regulatory requirements add additional constraints. In this review, key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing translatable hydrogels are outlined and their performance in biological systems is summarized. The examples of effective polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations that have yielded clinically approved hydrogel products are specifically highlighted. These hydrogel design parameters in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers, providing a guideline for the rational selection of polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations to construct hydrogels with high translational potential are further considered.

         <title>Adipocyte&#8208;Derived Anticancer Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, are engineered to be a controllable, effective, and biocompatible drug delivery system for cancer therapy. It is demonstrated that the lipid droplet can augment the therapeutic performance of encapsulated drug via several pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a promising material with clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC50 value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0&#8208;fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.

         <title>Imaging and Controlling Photonic Modes in Perovskite Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under a resonant femtosecond pulsed laser (fs&#8208;laser) excitation, the spatial pattern of the photonic modes in a CsPbBr3 microcavity is revealed by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), which is the strong coupling of excitons and photons in the perovskite microcavity. Mode control through light field and structure is also mapped by the PEEM technique in real space and real time.








Abstract
Perovskite microcavities have excellent photophysical properties for integrated optoelectronic devices, such as nanolasers. Imaging and controlling the photonic modes within the cavity are fundamentally important to understand and develop applications. Here, photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is used to image the photonic modes within optical microcavities with a nanometer&#8208;scale spatial resolution. From a CsPbBr3 microcavity, hybrid mode patterns are observed. Spatial frequency spectrum analysis on the patterns uncovers the characteristic cavity modes, which are modeled with transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves, and assigned to exciton&#8211;polariton modes. Based on this understanding, the light focus in a designed microcavity is imaged in real space and controlled by the light field polarization. The study confirms that the cavity modes in perovskites can be effectively observed by the PEEM technique under resonant excitation, which, in turn, promotes the design of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite microcavities.

&lt;p&gt;Under a resonant femtosecond pulsed laser (fs-laser) excitation, the spatial pattern of the photonic modes in a CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microcavity is revealed by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), which is the strong coupling of excitons and photons in the perovskite microcavity. Mode control through light field and structure is also mapped by the PEEM technique in real space and real time.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite microcavities have excellent photophysical properties for integrated optoelectronic devices, such as nanolasers. Imaging and controlling the photonic modes within the cavity are fundamentally important to understand and develop applications. Here, photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is used to image the photonic modes within optical microcavities with a nanometer-scale spatial resolution. From a CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microcavity, hybrid mode patterns are observed. Spatial frequency spectrum analysis on the patterns uncovers the characteristic cavity modes, which are modeled with transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves, and assigned to exciton&#8211;polariton modes. Based on this understanding, the light focus in a designed microcavity is imaged in real space and controlled by the light field polarization. The study confirms that the cavity modes in perovskites can be effectively observed by the PEEM technique under resonant excitation, which, in turn, promotes the design of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite microcavities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Elastomer&#8208;Actuated Reconfigurable Microscale Kirigami Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable and reconfigurable metasurfaces at the microscale are achieved by using uniaxially aligned liquid crystal elastomer film as artificial muscle to thermally actuate kirigami microstructures 3D&#8208;printed via the two&#8208;photon polymerization technique. This strategy paves the way to a host of potential applications, such as tunable phononic/photonic crystals, optoelectronics, biomedical devices, camouflage, microelectromechanical systems, and soft microrobots.








Abstract
Programmable actuation of metastructures with predesigned geometrical configurations has recently drawn significant attention in many applications, such as smart structures, medical devices, soft robotics, prosthetics, and wearable devices. Despite remarkable progress in this field, achieving wireless miniaturized reconfigurable metastructures remains a challenge due to the difficult nature of the fabrication and actuation processes at the micrometer scale. Herein, microscale thermo&#8208;responsive reconfigurable metasurfaces using stimuli&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) is fabricated as an artificial muscle for reconfiguring the 2D microscale kirigami structures. Such structures are fabricated via two&#8208;photon polymerization with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Through rationally designed experiments guided by simulations, the optimal formulation of the LCE artificial muscle is explored and the relationship between shape transformation behaviors and geometrical parameters of the kirigami structures is build. As a proof of concept demonstration, the constructs for temperature&#8208;dependent switching and information encryption is applied. Such reconfigurable kirigami metastructures have significant potential for boosting the fundamental small&#8208;scale metastructure research and the design and fabrication of wireless functional devices, wearables, and soft robots at the microscale as well.

         <title>An Oligonucleotide&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Responsive Organic Transistor for Platinum&#8208;Drug&#8208;Induced DNA&#8208;Damage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With specific responsiveness to oligonucleotide distortion on organic semiconductor surface, the double&#8208;stranded DNA functionalized organic thin&#8208;film transistor can detect platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced DNA damage at single site level. The organic&#8208;transistor&#8208;based ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor can be further integrated into arrayed biochip for high&#8208;throughput DNA&#8208;damage analysis under different environmental conditions.








Abstract
Organic transistor with DNA&#8208;damage evaluation ability can open up novel opportunities for bioelectronic devices. Even though trace amounts of drugs can cause cumulative gene damage in vivo, the extremely low occurrence proportion makes them hardly transduced into detectable electric signals. Here, an ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor based on an oligonucleotide&#8208;distortion&#8208;responsive organic transistor (DROT) is reported by creating controllable conformation change of double&#8208;stranded DNA on the surface of organic semiconductors. In combination with interfacial charge redistribution and efficient signal amplification, the DROT provides an ultrasensitive single&#8208;site DNA&#8208;damage response with 20.5 s even upon 1 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m cisplatin. The high generalizability of this DROT to three generations of classical platinum drugs and gene&#8208;relevant DNA damage is demonstrated. A biochip is further designed for intelligent damage analysis in complex environments, which holds the potential for high&#8208;throughput biotoxicity evaluation and drug screening in the future.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Kinetics with Highly Dispersed Conductive and Electrocatalytic Mediators for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid material is prepared to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals can effectively promote anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries is greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries is still impeded by the poor cycling performance and rate capability at practical conditions. In order to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries, a hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid based hollow spherical material (Mo2C/CHS) is designed and prepared. The hollow spheres composed of stacked carbon nanosheets can facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals are confined in the carbon nanosheets and expose more active sites for anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, Mo2C/CHS greatly promotes electrochemical kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with high sulfur loading (5 mg cm&#8722;2). Even under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 7 &#956;L mgsulfur&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S batteries with Mo2C/CHS added exhibit a discharge capacity of 904 mAh g&#8722;1 at the high current rate of 0.5 C, and with 894 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained after 200 cycles. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes and guides the rational design of host and additive materials for practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Surface Wettability of Nanoparticle Modulated Sonothrombolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface wettability modulated nanoparticles are designed to investigate the mechanism of sonodynamic therapy. The wettability of nanoparticles is related to the desorption energy between nanoparticles and nanobubbles. Higher desorption energy of the system consisted to higher stability of nanobubbles, more cavitation nuclei site, higher reactive oxygen species yield, and higher sonothrombolysis efficiency.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive and highly penetrating treatment strategy under ultrasound irradiation. However, uncertainty in the mechanism of SDT has seriously hindered its future clinical application. Here, the mechanism of SDT enhanced by the wettability of nanoparticles is investigated. Nanoparticles can adsorb and stabilize nanobubbles in liquid, thus enhancing SDT efficiency. The stability of the nanobubbles is positively correlated with the desorption energy of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the wettability of the nanoparticles. This conclusion is verified for mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles and it is found that nanoparticles with a water contact angle of about 90&#176; possess the largest desorption energy. To further apply this conclusion, thrombus models are constructed on rats and the experimental results demonstrate that nanoparticles with the largest desorption energy have the highest thrombolytic efficiency. It is believed that these findings will help to better understand the SDT mechanism and guide new strategies for rational design of nanoparticles adopted in SDT.

         <dc:description>
Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), which are non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species generation strategies, show great promise in fighting cancer. Recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies are summarized. The approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related therapeutic approaches are developed as a promising modality for cancer treatment because the aberrant increase of intracellular ROS level can cause cell death due to nonspecific oxidation damage to key cellular biomolecules. However, the most widely considered strategy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), suffers from critical limitations such as limited tissue&#8208;penetration depth, high oxygen dependence, and phototoxicity. Non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced ROS generation strategies, which are defined as Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), show good potential to overcome the drawbacks of PDT. Herein, recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies, including the design of systems, the working mechanisms, and examples of cancer therapy application, are introduced. Furthermore, the approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of these strategies are also discussed.

         <title>Super Stretchable and Durable Electroluminescent Devices Based on Double&#8208;Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super stretchable electroluminescent device is successfully fabricated with double&#8208;network ionogel as a soft electrode owing to its excellent mechanical robustness and electrical conductivity. The fabricated device exhibits extremely stable light&#8208;emitting operation even at high elongation as well as demonstrating mechanical, electrical, and thermal stability, which can be applied to new types of stretchable light display and sensors.








Abstract
Ionogels are good candidates for flexible electronics owing to their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, including stretchability, high conductivity, and stability. In this study, conducting ionogels comprising a double network (DN) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diethylacrylamide)/chitosan which are further reinforced by the ionic and covalent crosslinking of the chitosan network by tripolyphosphate and glutaraldehyde, respectively, are prepared. Based on their excellent mechanical properties and high conductivity, the developed DN ionogels are envisioned as stretchable ionic conductors for extremely stretchable alternating&#8208;current electroluminescent (ACEL) devices. The ACEL device fabricated with the developed ionogel exhibits stable working operation under an ultrahigh elongation of over 1200% as well as severe mechanical deformations such as bending, rolling, and twisting. Furthermore, the developed ACEL devices also display stable luminescence over 1000 stretch/release cycles or at temperatures as harsh as 200 &#176;C.

         <title>Programmable Metal Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) in the quantum size regime are an emerging class of new materials. The progress in the synthesis and structure&#8211;function correlation is summarized using gold NCs as a paradigm system. The rich types of structures impact the electronic and optical properties. For future work, the field will move toward &#8220;programmable&#8221; control with advanced synthesis methods.








Abstract
With the recent establishment of atomically precise nanochemistry, capabilities toward programmable control over the nanoparticle size and structure are being developed. Advances in the synthesis of atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs, 1&#8211;3&#160;nm) have been made in recent years, and more importantly, their total structures (core plus ligands) have been mapped out by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These ultrasmall Au nanoparticles exhibit strong quantum&#8208;confinement effect, manifested in their optical absorption properties. With the advantage of atomic precision, gold&#8208;thiolate nanoclusters (Aun(SR)m) are revealed to contain an inner kernel, Au&#8211;S interface (motifs), and surface ligand (&#8208;R) shell. Programming the atomic packing into various crystallographic structures of the metal kernel can be achieved, which plays a significant role in determining the optical properties and the energy gap (Eg) of NCs. When the size increases, a general trend is observed for NCs with fcc or decahedral kernels, whereas those NCs with icosahedral kernels deviate from the general trend by showing comparably smaller Eg. Comparisons are also made to further demonstrate the more decisive role of the kernel structure over surface motifs based on isomeric Au NCs and NC series with evolving kernel or motif structures. Finally, future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Transparent, Compliant 3D Mesostructures for Precise Evaluation of Mechanical Characteristics of Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D mesostructures are designed to mechanically and reversibly constrain organoids for measurements of their viscoelastic properties. Finite element analysis guides the selection of 3D layouts to grasp organoids with minimal force, without damage to the tissues. Nanoindentation applied directly to organoids gently held within these 3D structures allows for accurate and repeated measurements of force/displacement data. Changes in mechanical characteristics induced by drugs highlight responses to the chemical environment, as an application example.








Abstract
Recently developed methods for transforming 2D patterns of thin&#8208;film materials into 3D mesostructures create many interesting opportunities in microsystems design. A growing area of interest is in multifunctional thermal, electrical, chemical, and optical interfaces to biological tissues, particularly 3D multicellular, millimeter&#8208;scale constructs, such as spheroids, assembloids, and organoids. Herein, examples of 3D mechanical interfaces are presented, in which thin ribbons of parylene&#8208;C form the basis of transparent, highly compliant frameworks that can be reversibly opened and closed to capture, envelop, and mechanically restrain fragile 3D tissues in a gentle, nondestructive manner, for precise measurements of viscoelastic properties using techniques in nanoindentation. Finite element analysis serves as a design tool to guide selection of geometries and material parameters for shape&#8208;matching 3D architectures tailored to organoids of interest. These computational approaches also quantitate all aspects of deformations during the processes of opening and closing the structures and of forces imparted by them onto the surfaces of enclosed soft tissues. Studies of cerebral organoids by nanoindentation show effective Young's moduli in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 kPa depending on the age of the organoid. This collection of results suggests broad utility of compliant 3D mesostructures in noninvasive mechanical measurements of millimeter&#8208;scale, soft biological tissues.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Metal&#8211;Organic Gels for Oxygen Electrocatalysis: Structural and Compositional Considerations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach of improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. Several key compositional and structural considerations for the MOF/MOG design and new perspectives between synthesis, characterization, and performance are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Increasing demand for sustainable and clean energy is calling for the next&#8208;generation energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO2/N2 reduction electrolyzers, metal&#8211;air batteries, etc. All these electrochemical processes involve oxygen electrocatalysis. Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG&#8208;derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized. Critical challenges and future research directions are also outlined.

2D layered materials typically feature strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonding within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, in which various foreign species may be inserted without breaking the in&#8208;plane covalent bonds. By tailoring the composition, size, structure, and electronic properties of the intercalated guest species and the hosting layered materials, an expansive family of layered intercalation materials may be produced with highly variable compositional and structural features as well as widely tunable physical/chemical properties, invoking unprecedented opportunities in fundamental studies of property modulation and potential applications in diverse technologies, including electronics, optics, superconductors, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and energy storage. Here, the principles and protocols for various intercalation methods, including wet chemical intercalation, gas&#8208;phase intercalation, electrochemical intercalation, and ion&#8208;exchange intercalation, are comprehensively reviewed and how the intercalated species alter the crystal structure and the interlayer coupling of the host 2D layered materials, introducing unusual physical and chemical properties and enabling devices with superior performance or unique functions, is discussed. To conclude, a brief summary on future research opportunities and emerging challenges in the layered intercalation materials is given.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D layered materials typically feature strong in-plane covalent chemical bonding within each atomic layer and weak out-of-plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non-bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, in which various foreign species may be inserted without breaking the in-plane covalent bonds. By tailoring the composition, size, structure, and electronic properties of the intercalated guest species and the hosting layered materials, an expansive family of layered intercalation materials may be produced with highly variable compositional and structural features as well as widely tunable physical/chemical properties, invoking unprecedented opportunities in fundamental studies of property modulation and potential applications in diverse technologies, including electronics, optics, superconductors, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and energy storage. Here, the principles and protocols for various intercalation methods, including wet chemical intercalation, gas-phase intercalation, electrochemical intercalation, and ion-exchange intercalation, are comprehensively reviewed and how the intercalated species alter the crystal structure and the interlayer coupling of the host 2D layered materials, introducing unusual physical and chemical properties and enabling devices with superior performance or unique functions, is discussed.

         <title>Energy Harvesting and Storage: Energy Harvesting and Storage with Soft and Stretchable Materials (Adv. Mater. 19/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004832, Michael D. Dickey and co&#8208;workers highlight methods to convert ambient sources of energy into electricity using soft and stretchable materials. The ability to harness energy from the environment allows soft and stretchable devices to be tetherless, thereby leading to greater range of motion for soft robots, better mechanical compliance for wearables and e&#8208;skins, and increased applications for electronics.

         <title>HASEL Artificial Muscles for a New Generation of Lifelike Robots&#8212;Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators are a new, versatile class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles. Current research in materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and controls is discussed and the wide opportunities for future interdisciplinary research to realize HASEL artificial muscles with drastically improved performance for use as building blocks of bioinspired intelligent systems of the future are laid out.








Abstract
Future robots and intelligent systems will autonomously navigate in unstructured environments and closely collaborate with humans; integrated with our bodies and minds, they will allow us to surpass our physical limitations. Traditional robots are mostly built from rigid, metallic components and electromagnetic motors, which make them heavy, expensive, unsafe near people, and ill&#8208;suited for unpredictable environments. By contrast, biological organisms make extensive use of soft materials and radically outperform robots in terms of dexterity, agility, and adaptability. Particularly, natural muscle&#8212;a masterpiece of evolution&#8212;has long inspired researchers to create &#8220;artificial muscles&#8221; in an attempt to replicate its versatility, seamless integration with sensing, and ability to self&#8208;heal. To date, natural muscle remains unmatched in all&#8208;round performance, but rapid advancements in soft robotics have brought viable alternatives closer than ever. Herein, the recent development of hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a new class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles that couple electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve diverse modes of actuation, is discussed; current designs match or exceed natural muscle in many metrics. Research on materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and control systems for HASEL actuators is detailed. In each area, research opportunities are identified, which together lays out a roadmap for actuators with drastically improved performance. With their unique versatility and wide potential for further improvement, HASEL actuators are poised to play an important role in a paradigm shift that fundamentally challenges the current limitations of robotic hardware toward future intelligent systems that replicate the vast capabilities of biological organisms.

Geometrical difficulty from the structural complexity of sensing robots has been the main challenge in the production of sensing robots. 3D integrated electronics prepared by 3D printing is a potential solution for realistic sensing robot systems. The platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated, and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further in practical settings such as in healthcare and manufacturing units. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects is discussed.








Abstract
Advanced robotics is the result of various contributions from complex fields of science and engineering and has tremendous value in human society. Sensing robots are highly desirable in practical settings such as healthcare and manufacturing sectors through sensing activities from human&#8211;robot interaction. However, there are still ongoing research and technical challenges in the development of ideal sensing robot systems. The sensing robot should synergically merge sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty in the sensor positioning caused by the structural complexity of sensing robots and their corresponding processing have been the main challenges in the production of sensing robots. 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects prepared by the 3D printing process can be the potential solution for designing realistic sensing robot systems. 3D printing provides the advantage to manufacture complex 3D structures in electronics in a single setup, allowing the ease of design flexibility, and customized functions. Therefore, the platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects and the advanced material strategies, used to overcome the challenges, are discussed.

         <title>Recent Progress of Flexible Image Sensors for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest research of flexible image sensors for biomedical application&#160;is comprehensively reviewed. The individual components of an image sensor are described, along with basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of the image sensors and biomedical application of flexible image sensors are described. Finally, the outlook for future research regarding flexible image sensors is discussed.








Abstract
Flexible image sensors have attracted increasing attention as new imaging devices owing to their lightness, softness, and bendability. Since light can measure inside information from outside of the body, optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches, such as X&#8208;rays, are widely used for disease diagnosis in hospitals. Unlike conventional sensors, flexible image sensors are soft and can be directly attached to a curved surface, such as the skin, for continuous measurement of biometric information with high accuracy. Therefore, they are expected to gain wide application to wearable devices, as well as home medical care. Herein, the application of such sensors to the biomedical field is introduced. First, their individual components, photosensors, and switching elements, are explained. Then, the basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of each of these elements and the image sensors are described. Finally, examples of measuring the dynamic and static biometric information using flexible image sensors, together with relevant real&#8208;world measurement cases, are presented. Furthermore, recent applications of the flexible image sensors in the biomedical field are introduced.

&lt;p&gt;Flexible image sensors have attracted increasing attention as new imaging devices owing to their lightness, softness, and bendability. Since light can measure inside information from outside of the body, optical-imaging-based approaches, such as X-rays, are widely used for disease diagnosis in hospitals. Unlike conventional sensors, flexible image sensors are soft and can be directly attached to a curved surface, such as the skin, for continuous measurement of biometric information with high accuracy. Therefore, they are expected to gain wide application to wearable devices, as well as home medical care. Herein, the application of such sensors to the biomedical field is introduced. First, their individual components, photosensors, and switching elements, are explained. Then, the basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of each of these elements and the image sensors are described. Finally, examples of measuring the dynamic and static biometric information using flexible image sensors, together with relevant real-world measurement cases, are presented. Furthermore, recent applications of the flexible image sensors in the biomedical field are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exploiting Mechanical Instabilities in Soft Robotics: Control, Sensing, and Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical instabilities provide a novel route to achieve power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. An overview of the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. These strategies have the potential to address the current challenges in the areas of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation.








Abstract
The rapidly expanding field of soft robotics has provided multiple examples of how entirely soft machines and actuators can outperform conventional rigid robots in terms of adaptability, maneuverability, and safety. Unfortunately, the soft and flexible materials used in their construction impose intrinsic limitations on soft robots, such as low actuation speeds and low output forces. Nature offers multiple examples where highly flexible organisms exploit mechanical instabilities to store and rapidly release energy. Guided by these examples, researchers have recently developed a variety of strategies to overcome speed and power limitations in soft robotics using mechanical instabilities. These mechanical instabilities provide, through rapid transitions from structurally stable states, a new route to achieve high output power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. Here, an overview of the literature related to the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. Additionally, strategies using structural phase transitions to address current challenges in the area of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation are discussed. Approaches using instabilities to create entirely soft logic modules to imbue soft robots with material intelligence and distributed computational capabilities are also reviewed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imperceptible soft robotics have great potential to assist humans, and a great enhancement in robotics engineering is expected from the optical transparency of both actuators and sensors, along with camouflage skins. This soft robotic system will potentially enable great advancements in undercover military robots and assistive devices through the development of manufacturing and materials, and understanding the mechanics and working mechanisms and principles.








Abstract
The advent of soft robotics has led to great advancements in robots, wearables, and even manufacturing processes by employing entirely soft&#8208;bodied systems that interact safely with any random surfaces while providing great mechanical compliance. Moreover, recent developments in soft robotics involve advances in transparent soft actuators and sensors that have made it possible to construct robots that can function in a visually and mechanically unobstructed manner, assisting the operations of robots and creating more applications in various fields. In this aspect, imperceptible soft robotics that mainly consist of optically transparent imperceptible hardware components is expected to constitute a new research focus in the forthcoming era of soft robotics. Here, the recent progress regarding extended imperceptible soft robotics is provided, including imperceptible transparent soft robotics (transparent soft actuators/sensors) and imperceptible nontransparent camouflage skins. Their principles, materials selections, and working mechanisms are discussed so that key challenges and perspectives in imperceptible soft robotic systems can be explored.

         <title>Becoming Sustainable, The New Frontier in Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In future, robots will be seamlessly integrated in everyday life and&#8212;as much as consumer electronics is omnipresent today&#8212;assist in a myriad of tasks. However, environmental concerns at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life phase necessitate sustainable solutions for actuators, energy storage, electronics, and all involved materials. Soft and bioinspired robotics offer a remarkably unique potential to succeed this challenge.








Abstract
The advancement of technology has a profound and far&#8208;reaching impact on the society, now penetrating all areas of life. From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution&#8212;from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint. This review outlines the rise of sustainable materials in soft and bioinspired robotics, targeting all robotic components from actuators to energy storage and electronics. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in biobased robotics spans flourishing fields and applications ranging from microbots operating in vivo to biohybrid machines and fully biodegradable yet resilient actuators. These first steps initiate the evolution of robotics and guide them into a sustainable future.

         <title>Energy Harvesting and Storage with Soft and Stretchable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to harvest ambient energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electromagnetic energy) using soft and stretchable materials are summarized. These materials and devices pave the way for untethered soft robots, selfpowered sensors, wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins. The challenges and opportunities associated with ambient energy harvesting techniques are also discussed.








Abstract
This review highlights various modes of converting ambient sources of energy into electricity using soft and stretchable materials. These mechanical properties are useful for emerging classes of stretchable electronics, e&#8208;skins, bio&#8208;integrated wearables, and soft robotics. The ability to harness energy from the environment allows these types of devices to be tetherless, thereby leading to a greater range of motion (in the case of robotics), better compliance (in the case of wearables and e&#8208;skins), and increased application space (in the case of electronics). A variety of energy sources are available including mechanical (vibrations, human motion, wind/fluid motion), electromagnetic (radio frequency (RF), solar), and thermodynamic (chemical or thermal energy). This review briefly summarizes harvesting mechanisms and focuses on the materials&#8217; strategies to render such devices into soft or stretchable embodiments.

         <title>Locomotion of Miniature Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Miniature soft robots are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Critical analyses and discussions on the locomotion producible by soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are provided, with the aim of inspiring future development of miniature soft robots that can be significantly more dexterous and robust.








Abstract
Miniature soft robots are mobile devices, which are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Here, the key advancements and challenges of the locomotion producible by miniature soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are highlighted. It is highly desirable to endow these small machines with dexterous locomotive gaits as it enables them to easily access highly confined and enclosed spaces via a noninvasive manner. If miniature soft robots are able to capitalize this unique ability, they will have the potential to transform a vast range of applications, including but not limited to, minimally invasive medical treatments, lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, and search&#8208;and&#8208;rescue missions. The gaits of miniature soft robots are categorized into terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial locomotion. Except for the centimeter&#8208;scale robots that can perform aerial locomotion, the discussions in this report are centered around soft robots that are in the micro&#8208; to millimeter length scales. Under each category of locomotion, prospective methods and strategies that can improve their gait performances are also discussed. This report provides critical analyses and discussions that can inspire future strategies to make miniature soft robots significantly more agile.

         <title>Progress and Roadmap for Intelligent Self&#8208;Healing Materials in Autonomous Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing materials are exciting avenues toward sustainable and intelligent long lifespan robots. The history and recent advances in material strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics toward future development of the fully autonomous self&#8208;healing robots are reviewed.








Abstract
Robots are increasingly assisting humans in performing various tasks. Like special agents with elite skills, they can venture to distant locations and adverse environments, such as the deep sea and outer space. Micro/nanobots can also act as intrabody agents for healthcare applications. Self&#8208;healing materials that can autonomously perform repair functions are useful to address the unpredictability of the environment and the increasing drive toward the autonomous operation. Having self&#8208;healable robotic materials can potentially reduce costs, electronic wastes, and improve a robot endowed with such materials longevity. This review aims to serve as a roadmap driven by past advances and inspire future cross&#8208;disciplinary research in robotic materials and electronics. By first charting the history of self&#8208;healing materials, new avenues are provided to classify the various self&#8208;healing materials proposed over several decades. The materials and strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics are also reviewed and discussed. It is believed that this article encourages further innovation in this exciting and emerging branch in robotics interfacing with material science and electronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological tissues exhibit incredible dynamic plasticity, enabling organisms to grow and thrive in challenging environments. Inspired by such feats, engineers have begun to design robots capable of actively editing their own structure and behaviors. An overview of the literature on shape changing robots is provided, and how multifunctional materials will help solve grand challenges to enable next&#8208;generation robots is elucidated.








Abstract
One of the key differentiators between biological and artificial systems is the dynamic plasticity of living tissues, enabling adaptation to different environmental conditions, tasks, or damage by reconfiguring physical structure and behavioral control policies. Lack of dynamic plasticity is a significant limitation for artificial systems that must robustly operate in the natural world. Recently, researchers have begun to leverage insights from regenerating and metamorphosing organisms, designing robots capable of editing their own structure to more efficiently perform tasks under changing demands and creating new algorithms to control these changing anatomies. Here, an overview of the literature related to robots that change shape to enhance and expand their functionality is presented. Related grand challenges, including shape sensing, finding, and changing, which rely on innovations in multifunctional materials, distributed actuation and sensing, and somatic control to enable next&#8208;generation shape changing robots are also&#160;discussed.

         <title>Functional Fibers and Fabrics for Soft Robotics, Wearables, and Human&#8211;Robot Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relation map of dynamic fibers/fabrics with responsive functions, including actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting, is built for potential construction of a soft, safe, user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interface. It promises the seamless integration between actuators, sensors, and power sources into fibers/fabrics, envisaging self&#8208;regulated, autonomous, and intelligent robotic fibers/fabrics for daily functions and biomedical services.








Abstract
Soft robotics inspired by the movement of living organisms, with excellent adaptability and accuracy for accomplishing tasks, are highly desirable for efficient operations and safe interactions with human. With the emerging wearable electronics, higher tactility and skin affinity are pursued for safe and user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interactions.

         <title>Artificial Skin Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial skin perception that integrates the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system could endow current flexible electronic devices with higher intelligence. The recent progress, challenges, and prospects of artificial skin perception are discussed, offering some inspiration for the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent systems, especially soft robotics.








Abstract
Skin is the largest organ, with the functionalities of protection, regulation, and sensation. The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e&#8208;skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e&#8208;skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon&#8208;based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low&#8208;latency, and energy&#8208;efficient information&#8208;processing ability. In future, artificial skin perception would be a new enabling technology to construct next&#8208;generation intelligent electronic devices and systems for advanced applications, such as robotic surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Material Organic Haptic Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of emerging organic actuator materials and digital printing technologies for fabricating soft organic haptic actuators to emulate touch sensations is provided. In particular, the focus is on the challenges and potential solutions associated with integration of multi&#8208;material actuators. The progress in achieving compact, lightweight haptic actuators by combining different polymers and composites in freeform designs is reported.








Abstract
Haptic actuators generate touch sensations and provide realism and depth in human&#8211;machine interactions. A new generation of soft haptic interfaces is desired to produce the distributed signals over large areas that are required to mimic natural touch interactions. One promising approach is to combine the advantages of organic actuator materials and additive printing technologies. This powerful combination can lead to devices that are ergonomic, readily customizable, and economical for researchers to explore potential benefits and create new haptic applications. Here, an overview of emerging organic actuator materials and digital printing technologies for fabricating haptic actuators is provided. In particular, the focus is on the challenges and potential solutions associated with integration of multi&#8208;material actuators, with an eye toward improving the fidelity and robustness of the printing process. Then the progress in achieving compact, lightweight haptic actuators by using an open&#8208;source extrusion printer to integrate different polymers and composites in freeform designs is reported. Two haptic interfaces&#8212;a tactile surface and a kinesthetic glove&#8212;are demonstrated to show that printing with organic materials is a versatile approach for rapid prototyping of various types of haptic devices.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness, toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG)&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG&#8208;based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User&#8208;friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self&#8208;care capabilities.

         <title>Epigenetic Remodeling Hydrogel Patches for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epi&#8208;gel provides chemosensitivity recovery and immune activation via simultaneous remodeling of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;IC) stemness and innate immune response. A single dose of epi&#8208;gel pools the advantages of epigenetic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in the treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), achieving superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional drug delivery.








Abstract
The induced expansion of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;ICs) upon repeated exposure of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs forms a major cause for chemoresistance and cancer metastasis. Here, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive hydrogel patch is designed to modulate the plasticity of T&#8208;ICs in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to hormone&#8208; and HER2&#8208;targeting. The on&#8208;site formation of the hydrogel network patches tumors in a chemoresistant TNBC murine model and senses intratumoral reactive oxygen species for linker cleavage and payload release. Patch&#8208;mediated inhibition of the histone demethylase lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically regulates the switch of T&#8208;ICs from self&#8208;renewal to differentiation, rehabilitating their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the hydrogel patch enhances tumor immunogenicity and increases T&#8208;cell infiltration via epigenetic activation of innate immunity. A single&#8208;dose of the hydrogel patch harboring LSD1 inhibitor and chemotherapy agent efficiently suppresses tumor growth, postsurgical relapse, and metastasis. The superior efficacy against multidrug resistance further reveals the broad applicability of epigenetic remodeling hydrogel patches.

         <title>Interactive Materials for Bidirectional Redox&#8208;Based Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>

A redox&#8208;active catechol&#8208;based film can autonomously synthesize diffusible H2O2 signals that enable interactive communication with biology. The reducing redox activities of a bacterial culture provide the electrons that poise this film for subsequent electron&#8208;donation to O2 to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that induces redox&#8208;responsive gene expression.








Abstract
Emerging research indicates that biology routinely uses diffusible redox&#8208;active molecules to mediate communication that can span biological systems (e.g., nervous and immune) and even kingdoms (e.g., a microbiome and its plant/animal host). This redox modality also provides new opportunities to create interactive materials that can communicate with living systems. Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H2O2 signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O2 to generate H2O2. Electron&#8208;transfer from an Escherichia coli culture poises this film to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D Copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolate Coordination Polymer Nanosheets for Efficient and Selective Gene Silencing and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.








Abstract
Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method. These CP nanosheets can act as both an effective DNAzyme nanocarrier for gene therapy and an intrinsic photosensitizer for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is ascribed to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Because of the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsiveness of the CP nanosheets, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded CP nanosheets exhibit excellent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing of the early growth response factor&#8208;1 (EGR&#8208;1), with messenger RNA inhibited by 84% in MCF&#8208;7 (human breast cancer cells) and only 6% in MCF&#8208;10A (normal human mammary epithelial cells). After tail intravenous injection into MCF&#8208;7&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the CP nanosheets loaded with chlorin&#8208;e6&#8208;modified DNAzyme under photoirradiation show a high antitumor efficacy (88.0% tumor regression), demonstrating a promising therapeutic platform with efficient and selective gene silencing and PDT of cancer.

         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Leveraging on ENZ Metamaterials to Achieve 2D and 3D Hyper&#8208;Resolution in Two&#8208;Photon Direct Laser Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is enhanced to hyper&#8208;resolution by leveraging on the extraordinary laser writing collimation enabled by &#949;NZ metamaterials. The realization of ultrathin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses and a highly detailed Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221; bas&#8208;relief (500 nm full height) confirms full freedom in nanofabrication. These results show intriguing cues in trendsetting research scenarios and industry application.








Abstract
A novel technique is developed to improve the resolution of two&#8208;photon direct laser writing lithography. Thanks to the high collimation enabled by extraordinary &#949;NZ (near&#8208;zero) metamaterial features, ultrathin dielectric hyper&#8208;resolute nanostructures are within reach. With respect to the standard direct laser writing approach, a size reduction of 89% and 50%, in height and width respectively, is achieved with the height of the structures adjustable between 5 and 50&#160;nm. The retrieved 2D fabrication parameters are exploited for realizing extremely thin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses tailored through deep machine learning codes. The hyper&#8208;resolution achieved in the writing process enables the fabrication of a highly detailed dielectric 3D bas&#8208;relief (with full height of 500&#160;nm) of Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results show intriguing cues for the current and trendsetting research scenario in anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications and ultracompact photonics, paving the way for the realization of all&#8208;dielectric and apochromatic ultrathin imaging&#160;systems.

         <title>A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported.








Abstract
The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous&#8208;based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the passive solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy-intensive process, the solar water-purification rate is the highest reported.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous-based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy-intensive process, the passive solar water-purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Smart Hydrogel Releasing Immune Adjuvant Synchronized with Repeated Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alginate is conjugated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based smart hydrogel is formed in situ. Low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, can trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with an ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release to boost antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutics and forms of ionizing radiation can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). If there simultaneously exist immune adjuvants within the tumor, such antitumor immunity would be further amplified. However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.

         <title>Nanoporous Intermetallic Pd3Bi for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi is prepared through electrochemical etching of PdBi2, and it can achieve extraordinary catalytic performance with high selectivity and excellent stability for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions. The intermetallic interaction between the Pd and neighboring Bi sites in nanoporous Pd3Bi can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier for efficient NRR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction at ambient temperature is a green technology for artificial nitrogen fixation but greatly challenging with low yield and poor selectivity. Here, a nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi prepared by converting chemically etched nanoporous PdBi2 exhibits efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoporous intermetallic Pd3Bi can achieve high activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 59.05&#160;&#177; 2.27&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 21.52&#160;&#177; 0.71% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.05 m H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming most of the reported catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong coupling between the Pd&#8211;Bi sites bridges the electron&#8208;transfer channel of intermetallic Pd3Bi, in which the Bi sites can absorb N2 molecules and lower the energy barrier of *N2 for N2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the intermetallic Pd3Bi with bicontinuous nanoporous structure can accelerate the electron transport during the NRR process, thus improving the NRR performance.

         <title>Touch&#8208;Based Stressless Cortisol Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stress&#8208;free detection of cortisol using natural finger sweat is reported. Using an electrodeposited molecularly imprinted polymer with an embedded Prussian blue probe for label&#8208;free sensing and a highly permeable hydrogel for rapid natural sweat extraction from the fingertip, the sensor, in both strip and stretchable patch form factors, can detect the cortisol level in 3.5&#160;min with a simple touch.








Abstract
Tracking fluctuations of the cortisol level is important in understanding the body's endocrine response to stress stimuli. Traditional cortisol sensing relies on centralized laboratory settings, while wearable cortisol sensors are limited to slow and complex assays. Here, a touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor for rapid, simple, and reliable stress&#8208;free detection of sweat cortisol is described. The sensor readily measures fingertip sweat cortisol via highly selective binding to the cortisol&#8208;imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating. The MIP network is embedded with Prussian blue redox probes that offer direct electrical signaling of the binding event to realize sensitive label&#8208;free amperometric detection. Using a highly permeable sweat&#8208;wicking porous hydrogel, instantaneously secreted fingertip sweat can be conveniently and rapidly collected without any assistance. By eliminating time lags, such rapid (3.5&#160;min) fingertip assay enables the capture of sharp variations in cortisol levels, compared to previous methods. Such advantages are demonstrated by tracking cortisol response in short cold&#8208;pressor tests and throughout day&#8208;long circadian rhythm, along with gold&#8208;standard immunoassay validation. A stretchable epidermal MIP sensor is also described for directly tracking cortisol in exercise&#8208;induced sweat. The rapid touch&#8208;based cortisol sensor offers an attractive, accessible, stressless avenue for quantitative stress management.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells are fabricated, achieving a significant JSC boost by virtue of an optimized crystalline feature with the formation of a eutectic mixture with better acceptor crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and recombination and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current boost.








Abstract
The intrinsic electronic properties of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in coupling with morphological features dictate the output in organic solar cells (OSCs). New physical properties of intimate eutectic mixing are used in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 ternary blends to fine&#8208;tune the bulk heterojunction thin film morphology as well as their electronic properties. With enhanced thin film crystallinity and improved carrier transport, a significant JSC amplification is achieved due to the formation of eutectic fibrillar lamellae and reduced defects state density. Material wise, aligned cascading energy levels with much larger driving force, and suppressed recombination channels confirm efficient charge transfer and transport, enabling an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.84%. These results reveal the importance of utilizing specific material interactions to control the crystalline habit in blended films to form a well&#8208;suited morphology in guiding superior performances, which is of high demand in the next episode of OSC fabrication toward 20% PCE.

         <title>Conferring Ti&#8208;Based MOFs with Defects for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>

A defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) is successfully constructed by simple hydrogenation and serves as a new generation of robust sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, it also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to amplify production of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation. Besides, the degradability of D&#8208;MOF(Ti) is a bright spot for promoting its clinical transformation.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient, multifunctional, and biocompatible sonosensitizer is still a priority for current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) with greatly improved sonosensitizing effect is simply constructed and used for enhanced SDT. Compared with the commonly used sonosensitizer TiO2, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) results in a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield under ultrasound (US) irradiation due to its narrow bandgap, which principally improves the US&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation. Meanwhile, due to the existence of Ti3+ ions, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to enable chemodynamic therapy. Particularly, US as the excitation source of SDT can simultaneously enhance the Fenton&#8208;like reaction to achieve remarkably synergistic outcomes for oncotherapy. More importantly, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) can be degraded and metabolized out of the body after completion of its therapeutic functions without off&#8208;target toxicity. Overall, this work identifies a novel Ti&#8208;familial sonosensitizer harboring great potential for synergistic sonodynamic and chemodynamic cancer therapy.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Sub&#8208;Micrometer Particles by Modifying the Excess&#8208;Li Distribution</title>

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathode for a practical Li&#8208;ion battery system through a novel structural and morphological design is reported: a relatively delocalized excess&#8208;Li system in sub&#8208;micrometer particles. The lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized LMR exhibits an outstanding energy density over other prospective cathode materials, and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention in full&#8208;cells in practical conditions.








Abstract
In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li1.11Mn0.49Ni0.29Co0.11O2, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface is studied using near&#8208;field techniques to show conclusively topological transition accompanied by the emergence of the Wannier&#8208;type dipole polarization. Measurements across different boundaries reveal a hierarchy of topological boundary states: i) the first order edge states and ii) the second order corner states, including states induced by the long&#8208;range interactions within the metasurface.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight&#8208;binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long&#8208;range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all&#8208;dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier&#8208;type polarization. Two kinds of near&#8208;field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near&#8208;field imaging using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near&#8208;field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all&#8208;dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 22% via Small&#8208;Molecule Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate is introduced in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process, and external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes as high as 22.49% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high&#8208;quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T50 operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.

A N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere supported Pt single atom (Pt1/NMHCS) composite for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by a novel strategy. Owing to the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction in the unique N1&#8722;Pt&#8722;C2 coordination structure that significantly alters the electronic structure of the Pt 5d states, both the reduction of adsorbed H+ and the generation of H2 are promoted, thus leading to bare&#8208;Pt&#8208;like activity and extraordinary durability for HER.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20&#160;wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 50&#160;mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1&#8722;Pt1&#8722;C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H&#8722;H coupling, and thus Pt&#8208;like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atom&#8208;based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.

Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are developed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor configuration. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off is due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and short delayed exciton lifetime.








Abstract
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are reported. These materials are designed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) configuration, containing rigid boron acceptors and dihydrophenazine donor moieties. These materials exhibit a small &#916;EST of 0.05&#8211;0.06&#160;eV, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as near unity, and short delayed exciton lifetime (&#964;d) of less than 2.63 &#181;s in 5 wt% doped film. Further, these materials show a high reverse intersystem crossing rate (krisc) on the order of 106 s&#8722;1. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum EQE of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 576 nm and 595&#160;nm, respectively. The low roll&#8208;off character of these materials is analyzed by using a roll&#8208;off model and the exciton annihilation quenching rates are found to be suppressed by the fast krisc and short delayed exciton lifetime. These devices show operating device lifetimes (LT50) of 159 and 193 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 for PzTDBA and PzDBA, respectively. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off of these materials are attributed to the good electronic properties originatng from the A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecular configuration.

         <title>Optically and Electrocatalytically Decoupled Si Photocathodes with a Porous Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Nitrogen Reduction with Over 61.8% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH3 yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light&#8208;harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode is implemented. Such a decoupling design not only abolishes the parasitic light blocking but also concurrently improves the optical and electrical properties of the n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode without compromising the efficiency. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal that the porous architecture and N&#8208;vacancies promote N2 adsorption of the Au/porous carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. Impressively, an n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode integrating the Au/PCN catalyst exhibits an outstanding PEC NRR performance with maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.8% and NH3 production yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is the highest FE at low applied potential ever reported for the PEC NRR.

         <title>Reconstructable Gradient Structures and Reprogrammable 3D Deformations of Hydrogels with Coumarin Units as the Photolabile Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable shape&#8208;morphing of hydrogels is realized on the basis of reconstructable gradient networks containing coumarin units as photolabile crosslinks. Reversible photodimerization and photocleavage of coumarins at specific regions of one hydrogel are directed by photolithography. The reprogrammed structural gradients result in distinct internal stresses and 3D deformations of the hydrogel into different configurations.








Abstract
Morphing hydrogels have versatile applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices. Controlling component distribution and internal stress within a hydrogel is crucial for shape&#8208;changing. However, existing gradient structures of hydrogels are usually non&#8208;reconstructable, once encoded by chemical reactions and covalent bonds. Fabricating hydrogels with distinct gradient structures is inevitable for every new configuration, resulting in poor reusability, adaptability, and sustainability that are disadvantageous for diverse applications. Herein, a hydrogel containing reversible photo&#8208;crosslinks that enable reprogramming of the gradient structures and 3D deformations into various configurations is reported. The hydrogel is prepared by micellar polymerization of hydrophobic coumarin monomer and hydrophilic acrylic acid. The presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride micelles increases the local concentration of coumarin units and also improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by forming robust polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes that serve as the physical crosslinks. High&#8208;efficiency photodimerization and photocleavage reactions of coumarins are realized under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively, affording reversible tuning of the network structure of the hydrogel. Through photolithography, different gradient structures are sequentially patterned in one hydrogel that direct the deformations into distinct configurations. Such a strategy should be applicable for other photolabile hydrogels toward reprogrammable control of network structures and versatile functions.

         <title>Antimony Nanopolyhedrons with Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances for Highly Effective Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Photothermal/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins is reported, able to detect thermal degradation within widely used poly(ester imide) (PEI) resins. Trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products. Solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy is able to monitor long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.








Abstract
Monitoring polymer degradation is an important quest, particularly relevant for industry. Although many indirect methodologies for assessing polymer degradation exist, only few are applicable for an inline&#8208;monitoring via optic detection&#8208;systems. An inline&#8208;monitoring system is introduced for the thermal degradation of crosslinked poly(ester imide)s (PEIs) by embedding trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbene molecules, serving as chemosensors to track the release of generated alcoholic byproducts. Nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the sensors trifluoroacetyl functionality triggers hemiacetal formation which is accompanied by significant changes in optical properties, in turn allowing monitoring of sensor activation by direct spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers an easy detection tool for the inline thermal monitoring of PEI&#8208;degradation.

         <title>Superkinetic Growth of Oval Organic Semiconductor Microcrystals for Chaotic Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superkinetic crystal growth strategy is developed to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces by breaking the crystal growth anisotropy. The oval organic semiconductor microcrystals constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators, which enable low&#8208;threshold directional lasing.








Abstract
Synthesis of novel mesoscopic semiconductor architectures continually generates new photonic knowledge and applications. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces owing to the crystal growth anisotropy. Here, a superkinetic crystal growth method is developed to synthesize 2D oval organic semiconductor microcrystals. The solid source dispersion induces an exceptionally large molecular supersaturation for vapor deposition, which breaks the crystal growth anisotropy. The synthesized stadium&#8208;shaped organic semiconductor microcrystals naturally constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators. They support low&#8208;threshold lasing on high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor scar modes localized near the stadium boundary and directional laser emission assisted by the chaotic modes. These results will reshape the understanding of the crystal growth theory and provide valuable guidance for crystalline photonic materials design.

         <title>Metasurfaces: Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004376 Andrea Al&#249;, Alexander B. Khanikaev, and co&#8208;workers apply a near&#8208;field technique to investigate a higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface. They show that the near&#8208;field profiles reveal the topological nature of the optical modes (depicted as a torus). Topology manifests in the displacement of the Wannier center, giving rise to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states observed in the optical near&#8208;field.

         <title>Chemosensors: Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins  is reported by Wolfgang Binder and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100068, which is able to detect thermal degradation within poly(ester imide) resins, widely used as a coating  material for copper wires in electric motors. Trifluoroacetyl&#8208;functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products by solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, due to emission shifts induced by the hemiacetal formation, thus allowing monitoring of long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells: High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2007177, Feng Liu and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of ternary organic solar cells, achieving a significant JSC boost, by virtue of their optimized crystalline feature, with the formation of eutectic crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and nongeminate recombination, and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current amplification.

The human microbiome is an enormous source of clinical information and a promising area of personalized and precision medicine. Point&#8208;of&#8208;care medical nanobiosensors might define the landscape of microbiome&#8208;related diagnostics by exploiting the outstanding properties of nanomaterials. The strategies of international scientific consortia, diagnostics market, and the legal and societal issues related to this field are reviewed.








Abstract
Monitoring of the human microbiome is an emerging area of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Here, the potential of different nanomaterials and nanobiosensing technologies is reviewed for the development of novel diagnostic devices for the detection and measurement of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. Moreover, the current and future landscape of microbiome&#8208;based diagnostics is defined by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of current nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches, especially in the context of developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices that would meet the international guidelines known as REASSURED (Real&#8208;time connectivity; Ease of specimen collection; Affordability; Sensitivity; Specificity; User&#8208;friendliness; Rapid &amp; robust operation; Equipment&#8208;free; and Deliverability). Finally, the strategies of the latest international scientific consortia working in this field are analyzed, the current microbiome diagnostics market are reported and the principal ethical, legal, and societal issues related to microbiome R&amp;D and innovation are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

         <title>Recent Progress in Cartilage Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the origins of the outstanding lubricity of healthy articular cartilage is crucial both to potentially treat osteoarthritis symptoms, and for the design of better biomaterials. The mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication is reviewed, and the recent development of natural and of bioinspired lubricants are explored.








Abstract
Healthy articular cartilage, covering the ends of bones in major joints such&#160;as hips and knees, presents the most efficiently&#8208;lubricated surface known in nature, with friction coefficients as low as 0.001 up to physiologically high pressures. Such low friction is indeed essential for its well&#8208;being. It minimizes wear&#8208;and&#8208;tear and hence the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, and, by reducing shear stress on the mechanotransductive, cartilage&#8208;embedded chondrocytes (the only cell type in the cartilage), it regulates their function to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the origins of such low friction of the articular cartilage, therefore, is of major importance in order to alleviate disease symptoms, and slow or even reverse its breakdown. This progress report considers the relation between frictional behavior and the cellular mechanical environment in the cartilage, then reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication. Following recent advances based on hydration lubrication, a proposed synergy between different molecular components of the synovial joints, acting together in enabling the low friction, has been proposed. Additionally, recent development of natural and bio&#8208;inspired lubricants is reviewed.

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.
