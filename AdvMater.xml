         <title>Highly Efficient Platinum&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution From Low&#8208;cost Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;free hydrogen photocatalysis is achieved using dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide&#8208;based conjugated polymers, self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles via nanoprecipitation. Through side chain engineering and donor&#8211;acceptor design, these materials reach a hydrogen evolution rate of 209 mmol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. The structure&#8211;function insights presented here establish rational design principles for efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable organic photocatalysts.








Abstract
While the interest in hydrogen photocatalysis from organic semiconductors is rapidly growing, there is a necessity to achieve hydrogen production without platinum (Pt), considering its price, availability and toxicity. In this work, this is demonstrated that high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiencies can be achieved without the use of Pt. A series of low&#8208;cost conjugated polymers are designed around the dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide (BTSO) unit, and self&#8208;assembled as nanoparticles in water via the nanoprecipitation technique. This is highlighted that how side chain engineering, nanoparticle morphology and pH influence the hydrogen evolution rate. Optoelectronic properties are improved through a Donor&#8208;Acceptor structure, resulting in an unprecedented hydrogen evolution reaction rate of 209&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of Pt. A clear correlation between high efficiencies and number of BTSO units within the polymer backbone can be established. The design rules pioneer the design of future organic materials is presented for a cost&#8208;efficient and sustainable hydrogen photocatalysis.

         <title>3D Ordered Macroporous Superstructures of High Entropy Hydroxide with Strong Orbital Coupling Enhancing Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous high&#8208;entropy hydroxides enhances mass transfer and active sites exposure, and enhance local OH&#8722; concentration and electric field strength, and the strong coupling between atomic orbitals facilitates electron transfer and promotes electrical activity, which shows high durability and corrosion resistance in water/seawater electrolysis with high current density.








Abstract
The water splitting performance is strongly influenced by intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the accessibility of the active center. Herein, high&#8208;entropy hydroxides (HEH) with 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure are prepared by chemical etching method with rational design. The 3DOM structure can maximize the exposure of the active sites and also facilitates bubble transport. As demonstrated by finite element analysis, the 3DOM structure modifies the spatial curvature of the catalyst, resulting in the enrichment of OH&#8722;. Moreover, the strong orbital coupling of transition metals significantly regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst, selectively adsorbs OH&#8722; at Fe sites, and inhibits the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Thanks to these characteristics, 3DOM&#8208;HEH&#8208;300 shows the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1 m KOH (182 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 211 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), and stables operation of more than 400 h. Besides, in natural seawater, it also exhibits the best catalytic activity (245 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 278 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), which is better than similar catalysts without 3DOM structure. This work verifies the great synergistic effect of high entropy and mass transfer on the performance of OER, which also provides a new idea for constructing high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Green Solvent&#8208;Processed 2D Nanomaterials for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocross&#8208;linking strategy is proposed for the patterning and integration of scalable vertical van der Waals heterostructures such as field&#8208;effect transistors, logic gates, and memory devices composed of 2D nanomaterials by UV light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linker in isopropyl alcohol. To optimize the alcohol&#8208;based dispersion system, Hansen solubility parameter analysis is performed to identify a solvent capable of simultaneously stabilizing both the 2D nanomaterials and the cross&#8208;linker.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed 2D nanomaterials have emerged as key building blocks for the large&#8208;scale assembly of functional electronic devices. Solution processing enables the formation of electronically active percolated networks by leveraging van der Waals (vdW) interactions between individual 2D nanosheets. While effective vdW interactions are expected to minimize potential energy barriers and contact resistances between nanosheets, undesired residues from material synthesis or device fabrication processes may remain at the interface. In particular, the ideal solvent candidates for optimizing the stability of 2D dispersions are typically difficult to remove due to their high boiling points and exhibit environmental toxicity. Additionally, conventional patterning processes require multiple solvents, which can disrupt vdW interfaces and degrade device performance. To address these challenges, a comprehensive process that combines 2D dispersion preparation with a cross&#8208;linker&#8208;based direct photopatterning technique is developed using an eco&#8208;friendly green solvent. To enable this process, the stability of 2D nanomaterials and ultraviolet light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linkers is thoroughly analyzed using Hansen solubility parameters. The developed process successfully enables the preparation of stable dispersions of cross&#8208;linkers and 2D nanomaterials, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten diselenide, and hafnium disulfide, which can then be assembled via vdW interactions to create large&#8208;scale functional electronic devices.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production via Small Molecules Electrooxidation&#8208;Assisted Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation&#8208;assisted hybrid electrochemical systems provide an appealing solution for achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. This review summarizes recent advances in such hybrid systems, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, bipolar hydrogen production, and electricity output. In addition, the remaining challenges and future prospects for hybrid energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production systems are discussed.








Abstract
To alleviate overdependence on traditional fossil resources, green hydrogen (H2) production from an electrochemical water splitting (EWS) system powered by renewable energy resources (i.e., tidal, wind, and solar energy) has garnered considerable attention for its environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the H2 production efficiency of the EWS system is restricted by the sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which inhibits its further large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, recent advances in the hybrid EWS systems that substitutes OER with the thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation reaction (SMEOR) to integrate with the hydrogen evolution reaction are reviewed. First, the catalytic mechanisms of electrocatalysts toward SMEOR, reactor configurations, and evaluation parameters are briefly summarized. Next, the advantages and characteristics of the hybrid systems of SMEOR integrated with hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction are highlighted and discussed in detail, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, production of value&#8208;added chemicals, bipolar H2 production, and electricity output. Subsequently, the optimization strategies for rationally engineering the catalysts of SMEOR are proposed. Last, the current obstacles and future expectations of the hybrid EWS systems are outlined. This review aims to stimulate the further evolution of green H2 production.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Antimony Chalcogenide Tandem Solar Cells via Thermal&#8208;Evaporated CdS Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing thermal evaporation to prepare high&#8208;quality CdS electron transport layers, this study achieves 7.46% PCE in a semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 device and 10.51% PCE in a 4T Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 tandem cell, surpassing the 10% efficiency limit for all antimony&#8208;based solar cells for the first time.








Abstract
Sb2S3, with an ideal bandgap of 1.7 eV, is a promising top&#8208;cell absorber for tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, CdS electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared via chemical bath deposition suffer from poor crystallinity and high roughness, inducing interfacial defects, parasitic absorption, and severe carrier recombination, which hinder device performance. To address these challenges, this study employs thermal evaporation (TE) to fabricate CdS ETLs for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. The TE&#8208;CdS films exhibit superior crystallinity, reduced roughness, and enhanced chemical purity. Sb2S3 films deposited on TE&#8208;CdS show preferential (hk1) orientation, improved crystallinity, optimized band alignment, and suppressed interfacial defects, facilitating efficient charge transport and light management. By incorporating a MoO3/ITO/Ag electrode, the semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46%, the highest reported efficiency for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. Furthermore, a four&#8208;terminal (4T) TSC, formed by mechanically stacking Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 cells, attains the champion PCE of 10.51% for all&#8208;antimony chalcogenide&#8208;based TSCs. This study provides critical insights into ETL engineering for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent Sb&#8208;based solar cells and their tandem integration.

A fast&#8208;charging graphite anode (C@MEG) with rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport and low interfacial resistance is demonstrated for Ah&#8208;level lithium&#8208;ion pouch batteries, offering high energy density, high power density, short charging time and long cycle life. This work provides valuable insights for the fast&#8208;charging applications of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exponential growth of electric vehicle industry necessitates to rapidly develop fast&#8208;charging technology for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the mainstream graphite anode encounters significant challenges in fast&#8208;charging scenarios, including capacity decay and shortened lifespan caused by the sluggish lithiation kinetics and unstable solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, the kilogram&#8208;level scalable production of ultrafast&#8208;charging anode (C@MEG) consisting of micro&#8208;expanded graphite coated by an ultrathin disordered carbon layer (5&#160;nm) is reported, which simultaneously compensates for the conventional limitation of internal lithium diffusion kinetics and reconfigures the external electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This uniqueness endows rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport, with minimized electrode polarization, enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior, and reduced interface impedance. At an ultrafast&#8208;charging rate of 10 C, this Li||C@MEG cell exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 157 mAh g&#8722;1, superior to pristine graphite (71 mAh g&#8722;1) and previously reported graphite anodes. Moreover, this assembled 1 Ah&#8208;level C@MEG||LiCoO2 pouch battery delivers remarkable fast&#8208;charging cyclability, showcasing 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under 3 A, together with high power density around 1500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 under 10 A, corresponding to a short charging time of only 4.2 min, demonstrative of applicability. This work presents a practical scalable fast&#8208;charging anode toward high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power and long&#8208;life batteries.

         <title>Fundamental Limits on the Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Superconducting Tc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving room&#8208;temperature superconductivity is a major goal in condensed matter physics. This work shows that room&#8208;temperature superconductivity, at least when mediated by phonons, is possible only in hydrogen&#8208;rich compounds known as superhydrides. A central result is the identification of a fundamental upper limit to electron&#8208;phonon interactions beyond which a stable metallic state cannot be maintained.








Abstract
Fundamental upper bounds on the electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature Tc in metals are established based on the intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice under strong interaction. This instability explains why observed electron&#8208;phonon coupling constants are limited to &#955; &#8818; 4. The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced Tc, which emerges near the instability threshold. Based on theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental data, room&#8208;temperature phonon&#8208;mediated superconductivity is found to be feasible exclusively in hydrogen&#160;compounds.

         <title>The Synergy Between In Situ Gradient Polymerization and Phase Separation Enables Practical Solid&#8208;State Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient&#8208;polymerized solid polymer electrolyte with petaloid phase separation is developed via in situ polymerization. It delivers high ionic conductivity (1.5 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;1) and excellent cathode compatibility, enabling high&#8208;performance full cells for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional safety property. However, most of the previously reported SPEs cannot well match with high&#8208;loading and high&#8208;voltage cathodes due to their low ionic conductivity and limited anodic stability. Herein, a SPE with superior compatibility with high&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich cathodes is generated by in situ gradient polymerization of a deep eutectic electrolyte. Besides, a polymerization&#8208;induced petaloid phase separation structure enhances interfacial ion transport, resulting in a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled high&#8208;loading (19.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM811||graphite full battery exhibites a high capacity retention of 85.3% after 200 cycles and outstanding rate performance (1 C). Industrial 1.2 Ah NCM811||SiOx pouch cell demonstrates unprecefented energy density of 382&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Moreover, this SPE also exhibits significantly enhanced safety characteristics, delaying the onset temperature of heat release from 157&#160;&#176;C to 266&#160;&#176;C and thermal runaway temperature from 198&#160;&#176;C to 312&#160;&#176;C. This study provides a general and practical avenue to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Achieving Abnormal Evaporation Behavior Using Melanin/Cellulose&#8208;Based Solar Evaporators via Salt Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bilayer aerogel with salt ion enrichment, demonstrating exceptional water management and photothermal performance. The aerogel exhibits a higher evaporation rate in high&#8208;salinity brines than in pure water, mitigating performance degradation from salt deposition and hydration effects in seawater desalination. Additionally, it exhibits excellent versatility and long lifetime, offering a viable solution for large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for seawater desalination, offering a potential remedy to the global water crisis. However, its widespread application is hindered by reduced performance in high&#8208;salinity brines and limited evaporator lifetimes. Inspired by natural melanins, amino acid&#8208;doped poly(norepinephrine) nanoparticles (PNE NPs) are developed as photothermal materials, encapsulated in a cellulose&#8208;based aerogel to form a 3D bilayer porous structure with salt ion enrichment effects. The interaction between the enriched ions in the aerogel weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, reducing evaporation enthalpy and enhancing evaporation rates. Under one sun illumination, the evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 4.06&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in high&#8208;concentration saline, surpassing the rate in pure water (3.51&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), with the rate increasing further as salt concentration rises. Notably, even the blank control group without photothermal materials shows an evaporation rate of 1.70&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the aerogel's strong intrinsic evaporation performance. The aerogel maintains its performance over five months of immersion in water without significant degradation. This low&#8208;cost, cellulose&#8208;based aerogel offers a promising solution to the issue of evaporation performance degradation in high&#8208;salinity brines, making large&#8208;scale solar desalination a feasible and effective option.

However, its widespread application is hindered by reduced performance in high-salinity brines and limited evaporator lifetimes. Inspired by natural melanins, amino acid-doped poly(norepinephrine) nanoparticles (PNE NPs) are developed as photothermal materials, encapsulated in a cellulose-based aerogel to form a 3D bilayer porous structure with salt ion enrichment effects. The interaction between the enriched ions in the aerogel weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, reducing evaporation enthalpy and enhancing evaporation rates. Under one sun illumination, the evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 4.06&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in high-concentration saline, surpassing the rate in pure water (3.51&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), with the rate increasing further as salt concentration rises. Notably, even the blank control group without photothermal materials shows an evaporation rate of 1.70&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating the aerogel's strong intrinsic evaporation performance. The aerogel maintains its performance over five months of immersion in water without significant degradation. This low-cost, cellulose-based aerogel offers a promising solution to the issue of evaporation performance degradation in high-salinity brines, making large-scale solar desalination a feasible and effective option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Innate Immunity&#8208;Guided Macrophage&#8208;Homing Nanoplatform for Oral Tumor Immunotherapy and Real&#8208;Time Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging in Pre&#8208;Clinical Models</title>

An oral, innate immunity&#8208;guided tumor&#8208;homing nanoplatform leverages the migratory behavior of macrophages to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug for immunotherapy and Ag2Te quantum dots for NIR&#8208;II imaging. At the tumor site, &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 reprograms macrophages to enhance immune responses, reduce fibrosis, and improve treatment efficacy, while Ag2Te enables real&#8208;time deep&#8208;tissue imaging of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and a high propensity for liver metastasis. This study presents an innate immunity&#8208;guided, macrophage (M&#934;)&#8208;homing nanoplatform that enables oral delivery of theranostic agents to PDAC lesions by harnessing the migratory behavior of endogenous M&#934; toward tumor&#8208;derived immune cues. The nanoplatform integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug&#8212;constructed by conjugating &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus) with the immunomodulator resiquimod (R848) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linker&#8212;and Ag2Te quantum dots (QDs) for near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, forming &#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te nanoparticles (NPs). Upon oral administration, &#946;Glus facilitates the selective uptake of NPs by intestinal M&#934; (&#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te NPs@M&#934;), which subsequently migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). There, elevated ROS levels trigger the release of R848, reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated M&#934; from an immunosuppressive M2 to an immunoactive M1 phenotype. This immune activation remodels the stroma, enhances T cell infiltration, and transforms the TME into an immunoactive state, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, Ag2Te QDs enable deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;II imaging for real&#8208;time visualization of PDAC progression, liver metastasis, and treatment response. Guided by innate immune signals, this M&#934;&#8208;homing theranostic platform offers a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in PDAC treatment by integrating targeted immunotherapy with noninvasive, real&#8208;time disease monitoring.

         <title>Thiophene Expanded Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer as Hole Transport Layer for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 20.78%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed two thiophene expanded self&#8208;assembled monolayers, which shows better structural order that helps to enlarge the dipole moment, improve the hole extraction ability, and suppress the charge recombination, thus yielded an impressive efficiency of 20.78% for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transport layers (HTLs) have achieved groundbreaking progress of device efficiency in perovskite and organic photovoltaics. Expanding the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of carbazole is an effective approach to enhance the molecular dipole moment and facilitate charge extraction of SAMs. However, this strategy tends to cause poor solubility and excessive self&#8208;aggregation of SAMs. In this work, two highly efficient SAMs are developed by substituting a non&#8208;fused thiophene unit on 3,6&#8208;position of carbazole, namely (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonate (2PAThCz) and diethyl (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonate (4PAThCz). The introduction of thiophene can completely alter the molecular packing behavior of SAM, promoting more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and increasing dipole moment, which enhances hole transport. Furthermore, the long spacer length on 4PAThCz enable to help it achieves excellent solubility, inhibit self&#8208;aggregation, and strengthen the molecular orderliness. As a result, an impressive efficiency of 20.78% (certified as 20.45%) is achieved for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.

         <title>Highly Deformable, Ion&#8208;Conductive Borohydride&#8208;Substituted Sulfide Electrolyte for Superior Performance at Low Stack Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LPSBH combines features of argyrodite and glass &#8208; ceramic, providing high deformability across the full molding pressure range. This facilitates the formation of high&#8208;quality solid&#8211;solid interfaces, enabling stable 1000&#8208;cycle performance at 25 &#176;C in laminated NCM/Graphite cells under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems that can replace conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Further enhancement in battery performance requires the formation of a stable physical interfacial contact between the active material (AM) in the electrode and the solid electrolyte (SE). However, reducing the resistance at the AM&#8211;SE interface remains a key challenge. This study focuses on Li3PS4&#8208;xLiBH4 (LPSBH), a sulfide&#8208;based SE with an argyrodite structure, synthesized by mechanical milling. Although LPSBH is known for its high ionic conductivity, its mechanical properties are not thoroughly examined. Here, the deformability of LPSBH is evaluated by demonstrating that it can be formed at low pressures to achieve high relative density. A quantitative evaluation of the AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact using symmetric cells demonstrates the formation of a good AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact within the electrode layer. A 13 mAh&#8208;class laminated cell with LPSBH stacked onto the negative electrode achieves 6C charging at 25 &#176;C&#160;under a low stacked pressure of 5&#160;MPa, along with significant cycle stability, which retains &#8776;70% capacity after 1000 cycles under 1C/1C conditions.

         <title>Tailoring COFs with Water and Oxygen Pathways for Efficient Catalyst Interfaces in PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation and side&#8208;chain engineering created independent water&#8208;oxygen channels in COFs to boost mass transport. Using P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as a binder optimized these channels, greatly enhancing the Pt/C catalyst performance. This resulted in a marked increase in PEMFC peak power density, even with reduced platinum loading, highlighting the role of COFs in improving both catalyst efficiency and transport kinetics.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency and clean emissions. However, reducing platinum (Pt) loadings in PEMFCs remains challenging due to the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. This study investigates phosphorylated covalent organic frameworks (P&#8208;rCOFs) as ionomers in PEMFCs, aiming to optimize the three&#8208;phase interface at the catalyst surface. Through the protonation of tertiary amine sites and precise structural engineering of side chains within the COF framework, well&#8208;defined transport channels are created to enhance water and oxygen mass transfer. The results demonstrate that P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 significantly improves the catalytic performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential 37&#160;mV higher than Nafion. Furthermore, a PEMFC incorporating P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as an ionomer binder achieves a peak power density of 2.40&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 catalyst loading, a 1.5 fold increase over Nafion. This work underscores the potential of P&#8208;rCOFs in optimizing the three&#8208;phase interface, offering a promising pathway for more efficient and cost&#8208;effective PEMFCs.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Dislocated WO3 Photocathode Toward Efficient Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the photoexcitation properties of Li2O2, a strategy for constructing a Z&#8208;type heterojunction at the photocathode@Li2O2 interface is proposed for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. This Z&#8208;type heterojunction acts as a charge modulation channel for carrier dynamics within Li2O2 through photocathode modifications. By utilizing edge dislocation &#8208;WO3 as the photocathode, both high capacity and low overpotential are achieved.








Abstract
The operation of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 batteries critically depends on the highly reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode. However, the intrinsic insulating nature of Li2O2 fundamentally restricts reaction kinetics, posing a core challenge to practical applications. Here, it is demonstrate that the insulating properties of Li2O2 can be effectively improved by photoexcitation, attributed to the generation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers. It is inspired to develop photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries featuring Z&#8208;type photocathode@Li2O2 heterojunction, which serves as a charge modulation channel to regulate carrier dynamics through photocathode modifications. By employing edge&#8208;dislocated WO3 as the photocathode, sustained growth of Li2O2 films is observed with a thickness &gt;18&#160;&#181;m, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than typically reported values. Benefiting from the enhanced exciton dissociation of Li2O2 and improved oxidative capability of photocathode, the battery delivers an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 31&#160;800&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and a light&#8208;induced temperature of &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. In addition, a low polarization overpotential of 0.04&#160;V is achieved with high reversibility over 1&#160;000 h. The grasp of photoexcited Li2O2 within Li&#8208;O2 batteries can drive solutions beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Advances in Nature&#8208;Inspired Particles for Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes, researchers have developed plentiful particle materials for diverse bioanalytical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles, encompassing design principles, preparation methods, and bioanalytical applications is presented. It also critically evaluates the unresolved challenges hindering practical implementations in bioanalysis and proposes some promising research directions.








Abstract
Nature has evolved sophisticated prototypes to achieve functions from efficient separation to selective capture, targeted interaction, and interactive communication. These biological blueprints provide transformative inspiration for engineering advanced particle materials tailored for bioanalytical challenges. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles from natural prototypes to preparation methods and various bioanalytical applications. The design principle of nature&#8208;inspired particles originates from the unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes including biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids), subcellular particles (virus, extracellular vesicles (EVs), bacteria, and platelet), cells (erythrocyte, sperm cell, immune cell, and pollen), creatures (urchin and hedgehog), and minerals (zeolites). Various preparation methods have been developed to replicate the intricate features of these prototypes. These nature&#8208;inspired particles have demonstrated effectiveness in bioanalytical applications, such as i) adsorption, separation, and removal of biological molecules, ii) interaction, recognition, and capture of biological particles, iii) biological sensing, and iv) biological imaging. Some existing challenges and potential research opportunities have also been indicated in bioanalytical practice. It is anticipated that more nature&#8208;inspired particles would be created with programmable chemistry and topology, exhibiting integrated functions, and benefiting various practical bioanalytical applications with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data processing.

         <title>Macromolecular Boron&#8208;Based Salt Enables Dense Interphases for Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries represent a compelling next&#8208;generation energy storage system with practical energy densities exceeding 700 Wh kg&#8722;1, offering a promising pathway beyond current lithium&#8208;ion technology. However, their commercial viability remains constrained by deleterious interfacial reactions between lithium metal anodes and polysulfide&#8208;containing electrolytes. Herein, it is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), strategically designed to reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries. LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species. The LiFPB&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits superior lithium metal compatibility, achieving a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59%. Consequently, Li&#8208;S cells demonstrate markedly improved capacity retention from 50.9% to 75.7% over 200 cycles. This strategy has been successfully scaled to Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells, achieving practical energy densities of 408 Wh kg&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 75 cycles. This work presents an effective approach to developing long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries through the rational design of electrolyte salt.

         <title>Ionic Gels for Low&#8208;Grade Heat Energy Harvesting and Thermal Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels are increasingly recognized in energy harvesting and sensing for their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and outstanding thermoelectric performance. This review summarizes recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels for applications in low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting, thermal sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications, while highlighting current challenges and future optimization directions.








Abstract
Harvesting the low&#8208;grade heat energy from the environment and the human body remains an underutilized energy. Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels have garnered significant attention in the fields of energy harvesting and sensing due to their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and excellent thermoelectric performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels in application of temperature sensing and low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting. The narration begins with the introduction of the synthetic and natural polymer for i&#8208;TE gels. Then, various methods are discussed to enhance the mechanical performance (stretchability, self&#8208;healing, and mechanical durability) to satisfy the flexible device based on i&#8208;TE gels. Noticeably, this work emphatically summarizes the improvement methods of thermopower for i&#8208;TE gels, including the preparation of n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE gels and the bidirectional modulation of their thermopower. Finally, this work explores the diverse applications of i&#8208;TE gels, including low&#8208;grade heat harvesting, sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Amorphizing Iron Molybdate as a High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Multiple Insertion Reactions in the Metastable Structure</title>

The amorphizing iron molybdate (a&#8208;FMO) with its transition mechanism and electrochemical performance are elaborately revealed. Unlocking both the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in metastable structure, a&#8208;FMO endows a high&#8208;capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1cathode (231.6 mAh g&#8722;1cathode+anode in the full&#8208;cell) at room temperature and the superior cycling resilience at low temperature (&#8722;30 &#176;C).








Abstract
The rising energy demand for electric vehicles and energy storage has revived interest in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, present LMBs still mainly rely on conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2) with limited reversible capacity (&#8776;150 to &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1cathode), necessitating the paradigm to achieve a new host with abundant Li+ accommodation sites. Herein, it is proposed a high&#8208;capacity amorphizing iron molybdate cathode a&#8208;Fe2(MoO4)3 (a&#8208;FMO), which can reversibly unlock Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in the metastable structure. Different from its parent crystal and stoichiometric oxides mixtures, a&#8208;FMO, with its inherent metastable structure, can not only augment the lithium storage capacities with fully activated redox centers, but also attenuate the lattice confinements for Li+ ion migration. Consequently, the in&#8208;situ generated a&#8208;FMO electrode exhibited a notable reversible capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 500 cycles. It endowed a specific energy density of 597 Wh kg&#8722;1 and all&#8208;climate adaptability over 60 to &#8208;40 &#176;C benefited from the amorphizing nature, as well as negligible capacity degradation when cycling at &#8208;30 &#176;C. The identification of local structure evolutions and multiple&#8208;redox activations in amorphizing materials broadens the scope for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>A Bioinspired Piezoelectric Stress Buffer Layer for SiOx&#8208;Based Electrodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Breviceps adspersus epidermis in nature, a novel piezoelectric stress buffer layer is introduced to address challenges faced by SiOx electrodes. This innovative design significantly mitigates excessive volume expansion and stabilizes solid electrolyte interface of SiOx electrodes, yielding remarkable improvements in battery cycling and rate performance. These advances open pathways for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium battery applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity silicon suboxide (SiOx, 0 &lt; x &lt; 2) anodes have long faced the problems of huge volume expansion, fast capacity decay and unsatisfied rate performance. To overcome these bottlenecks, the volume expansion resistance and electrogenic Na+ transport functions of common rain frog (Breviceps adspersus) epidermis are introduced into the design philosophy of stress buffers for SiOx electrodes. Thereupon, a mechanically robust, piezoelectric (MP) stress buffer layer comprised of ferroelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles and a novel homopolymer (PCM) binder of cyanoethyl carbamate&#8208;containing methacrylate is developed. It is demonstrated that MP stress buffer layer with superior mechanical properties effectively inhibits excessive volume expansion and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interface along with much suppressed electrolyte decomposition. Meanwhile, MP stress buffer layer helps expedite the dealloying reaction kinetics of SiOx electrodes in half&#8208;cells, mainly owing to the generation of a stress&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field within MP stress buffer layer, conducive to improving battery rate performance. As a result, unprecedented cycling and rate performance can be realized in coin and home&#8208;made soft package cells with SiOx and SiOx/graphite composite electrodes. Such a design philosophy of stress buffer layers marks an important milestone in developing high&#8208;energy lithium batteries with SiOx&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolved Proton Management by Harnessing Merocyanine&#8208;Integrated Hydrogels as Regenerative Photoacid Matrices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merocyanine photoacids are covalently integrated into hydrophilic polymer networks to develop regenerative photoacid matrices with excellent pH&#8208;switching performance retention through multiple regeneration cycles. This gelation strategy not only overcomes inherent solubility limitations and enhances their alkaline tolerance of conventional PAGs, but also enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled, shape&#8208;dependent proton release kinetics governed by diffusion.








Abstract
Photomanipulation of the environmental pH plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction kinetics and engineering material functionalities. While conventional merocyanine photoacids offer pH modulability, their practical implementation is fundamentally constrained by aqueous dissolution and laborious regeneration. Here, a transformative strategy is reported through the covalent integration of merocyanine photoacids into hydrophilic polymer networks to construct regenerative photoacid matrices, which stably retain protons in the dark and spatiotemporally liberate them upon illumination. The photoacid matrix overcomes solubility constraints through adjustable merocyanine grafting density while simultaneously enhancing alkaline stability, thereby enabling shape&#8208;governed, diffusion&#8208;controlled proton release kinetics. The universality of this approach has been extensively verified in multiple polymer matrices with variable chemical compositions. Upon straightforward separation and acidic regeneration in the dark, the recovered matrices sustainably maintain robust photoactivated proton release capability. This not only enables programmable control over acid&#8211;base indicator discoloration but also guides hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of arylazopyrazole&#8208;based hydrogelators, yielding 3D supramolecular gel architectures with tailored complexity. Furthermore, spatially controlled directional proton liberation are established through synergistically addressing negative phototropic deformation within a low&#8208;density crosslinked photoacid matrix. This work creates a new paradigm for spatiotemporal pH manipulation in the development of autonomous materials through regenerative photoacid matrices.

         <title>Terminations Determine Energy&#8208;Level Alignment of Perovskite Buried Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the widely&#8208;reported &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221; in perovskite field is disclosed as the varying combinations of perovskite terminations at the buried interface. The substrate influences the electronic structure of the perovskite through inducing electron&#8208;transfer within different perovskite slabs near the interface. These findings highlight the potential of termination engineering to enhance the performance of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221;, where the semiconduction type of perovskite changes according to that of the substrate is a widely&#8208;reported, but so far not fully understood phenomenon in the field of perovskite. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of probing and comprehending the electronic properties of perovskite buried interfaces. Here, through broadly investigating 20 buried interfaces formed between different perovskites and organic hole or electron transport materials (HTMs or ETMs), it is revealed that the substrate&#8208;effect originates from the distinct energy&#8208;level alignments at HTM or ETM substrates. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this difference stems from varying proportions of two perovskite terminations, which are determined by the interaction between substrates and perovskite crystals. With such mechanism, the semiconduction type of perovskite by controlling the proportion of surface terminations is successfully tuned. These findings provide new insights into optimizing device performance through termination engineering.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enhanced Modular Ionic Skin for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Discriminability in Bidirectional Human&#8211;Robot Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning&#8208;enhanced modular ionic skin with broad&#8208;spectrum multimodal sensing is realized through a synergistic material&#8211;algorithm optimization strategy. This strategy involves hard&#8208;segment&#8208;modulated 1D/2D/3D&#8208;ionic conductors and a data&#8208;driven decoupling model trained on a curated multi&#8208;stimuli dataset. Demonstrated on wearable and robotic platforms, the system exhibits promising potential for intelligent, bidirectional human&#8211;robot interaction.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception systems that mimic the functionality of human skin are able to perceive complex external stimuli, facilitating advanced applications in human&#8208;machine interactions. However, current systems still struggle with limited sensing ranges and suboptimal decoupling strategies, restricting their effective multimodal sensing. To achieve broad&#8208;spectrum multimodal discriminability, a machine learning&#8208;enhanced modular ionic skin (MIS) is developed via a synergistic sensor&#8208;algorithm optimization strategy. From the sensing material perspective, process&#8208;controlled hard&#8208;segment modulation in the ionic gel enables the development of diverse ionic conductors with enhanced sensing properties: a minimum temperature coefficient of &#8722;4.00%&#160;&#176;C&#8315;&#185; (10&#8211;160&#160;&#176;C), a linear gauge factor of 2.95 (0&#8211;100%), and a maximum pressure sensitivity of 80.5 kPa&#8315;&#185; (0&#8211;1.3&#160;MPa). With respect to the decoupling algorithm, a data&#8208;driven decoupling model for the MIS is meticulously proposed and trained on a dedicated multi&#8208;stimuli dataset, achieving maximum decoupling ranges for temperature and pressure with prediction errors as low as 7.0%, while maintaining reliable strain detection despite temperature interference. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated in a multimodal wearable hand kit for operator hand recognition and a robotic gripper kit for feedback, highlighting its potential in bidirectional human&#8208;robot interaction.

&lt;p&gt;A machine learning-enhanced modular ionic skin with broad-spectrum multimodal sensing is realized through a synergistic material&#8211;algorithm optimization strategy. This strategy involves hard-segment-modulated 1D/2D/3D-ionic conductors and a data-driven decoupling model trained on a curated multi-stimuli dataset. Demonstrated on wearable and robotic platforms, the system exhibits promising potential for intelligent, bidirectional human&#8211;robot interaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimodal tactile perception systems that mimic the functionality of human skin are able to perceive complex external stimuli, facilitating advanced applications in human-machine interactions. However, current systems still struggle with limited sensing ranges and suboptimal decoupling strategies, restricting their effective multimodal sensing. To achieve broad-spectrum multimodal discriminability, a machine learning-enhanced modular ionic skin (MIS) is developed via a synergistic sensor-algorithm optimization strategy. From the sensing material perspective, process-controlled hard-segment modulation in the ionic gel enables the development of diverse ionic conductors with enhanced sensing properties: a minimum temperature coefficient of &#8722;4.00%&#160;&#176;C&#8315;&#185; (10&#8211;160&#160;&#176;C), a linear gauge factor of 2.95 (0&#8211;100%), and a maximum pressure sensitivity of 80.5 kPa&#8315;&#185; (0&#8211;1.3&#160;MPa). With respect to the decoupling algorithm, a data-driven decoupling model for the MIS is meticulously proposed and trained on a dedicated multi-stimuli dataset, achieving maximum decoupling ranges for temperature and pressure with prediction errors as low as 7.0%, while maintaining reliable strain detection despite temperature interference. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated in a multimodal wearable hand kit for operator hand recognition and a robotic gripper kit for feedback, highlighting its potential in bidirectional human-robot interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming Defects and Cavities into Colloidal Crystals Engineered With DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seed&#8208;mediated crystallization is adapted for colloidal crystals to design cavities and defect architectures through chemically programmed DNA sequences and appropriate seed particle geometry. This synthetic approach combines tenets from both atomic and colloidal crystallization to deliberately control defect formation in superlattices and enables the design of functional materials with unusual and tailorable properties.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from seed&#8208;mediated crystal growth in atomic and molecular systems, a strategy is developed for incorporating particle and volume defects into the interior of colloidal crystals consisting of programmable atom equivalents (PAEs, oligonucleotide&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles) assembled with DNA. Discrete PAEs spanning a range of shapes, sizes, and compositions serve as nucleation sites for seed&#8208;mediated colloidal crystal growth and are incorporated into the centers of colloidal crystal lattices as cavities. Importantly, seed PAE shapes or sizes that are geometrically mismatched with the colloidal crystal lattice symmetry introduce defects such as local lattice disorder and long&#8208;range grain boundaries that arise through geometric frustration. Colloidal crystals synthesized with plasmonic seed particles exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelength scattering cross&#8208;sections that are highly dependent upon cavity/particle size and shape. Taken together, these findings establish a platform for the deliberate introduction of 2 and 3D defects into colloidal crystals, which may inform the design of structures and materials for thermal management, sensing, and catalysis.

         <title>Design Strategies and Advancements in Organic Spintronics: from Material Engineering and Interfacial Modification to Functional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies and advancements in organic spintronics are comprehensively discussed in this review. In the research of active layer materials, spinterface, ferromagnetic electrode preparation, and functional devices, numerous design strategies are devised to optimize their spin&#8208;related performance and propel this field toward practical applications in the near future.








Abstract
Organic spintronics, which has emerged as a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, has recently attracted much research enthusiasm from both the scientific community and industry. As a category of materials typically composed of light elements, organic materials inherently possess weaker spin&#8210;orbit coupling and hyperfine interactions, which are considered beneficial for spin transport. Numerous organic materials have been meticulously synthesized to reveal their structure&#8210;performance relationships. The spinterface effect induced by the ferromagnetic metal/organic material interface has led to novel physical mechanisms. The development of functional devices has promoted this field toward practical applications. Herein, design strategies and advancements in this field are presented, focusing on active material design, interfacial modification, and functional devices. First, the review discusses the influence of the active layer design on spin&#8208;related properties, including the chemical structures of small molecules, polymers, their multicomponent regulation strategies, and chiral materials. Subsequently, the review enumerates reliable ferromagnetic electrode preparation methods and spinterface modification methods aimed at adjusting the spin injection and transport efficiency. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of the strategies for enhancing the performance of functional devices in this field is presented. Finally, a concise summary and prospective outlook are proposed, highlighting the necessity and potential for future advancements in organic spintronics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Layer&#8208;Based Iontronic Pressure Sensor Coupling Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Wide&#8208;Range Detection for Temperature/Pressure Dual&#8208;Mode Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS) is developed using silkworm cocoon ion gel and PU foam, enabling stepwise EDL formation and enhanced ion migration. This versatile strategy synergizes high/low&#8208;permittivity layers with porous architecture, adaptable to diverse material systems, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity and wide&#8208;range sensing. Coupled with machine learning, DLIPS realizes temperature/pressure dual&#8208;mode sensing and silent speech recognition.








Abstract
Iontronic pressure sensors are widely used in human motion monitoring and human&#8211;machine interactions owing to their high sensitivity, wide measurement range, and excellent resolution. However, conventional dielectric layer designs often involve complex fabrication processes, high costs, and limited performances. This paper proposes a novel sensor structure, the dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS), which integrates high&#8208; and low&#8208;permittivity layers. Validated using silkworm cocoon ion gel and open&#8208;cell polyurethane foam as dielectrics, the DLIPS exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (72548.7 kPa&#8722;1), a wide working pressure range (0.001&#8211;420 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit (0.832 Pa), and remarkable durability exceeding 5000 cycles. By leveraging the distinct responses of the capacitance and resistance to pressure and temperature, the sensor can simultaneously measure both parameters. A deep learning regression model is integrated to decouple the mixed temperature and pressure signals, enabling accurate identification. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity and capability to detect minute pressure fluctuations, the DLIPS exhibited strong potential for skin&#8208;mounted silent speech recognition systems, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 98.5%. Furthermore, the DLIPS provides a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for fabricating ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensors, underscoring its versatility in wearable technology applications.

         <title>Regulating Solvation Chemistries via Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Locally Concentrated Suspension Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal charged suspension electrolyte design strategy is proposed here, which tailors solvation structures and regulates deposition behaviors in Li metal batteries. Negatively charged additives, locally concentrated at the Li metal's surface under the internal electric field, alter the solvation chemistry by interacting with Li ions, resulting in fewer solvating solvent molecules and inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, are in great demand for powering modern society. Their energy density can further be significantly improved by using Li metal anodes; however, Li metal suffers from the critical challenges of unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) along with uncontrollable dendritic Li growth. Here, a universal electrolyte design principle is proposed and demonstrated by using suspension electrolytes with charged additives. The solvation structure of Li ions can be regulated, as negatively charged additives show strong electrostatic interaction with Li ions, leaving them weakly solvated in the electrolyte. Moreover, negatively charged additives carrying Li ions can be locally concentrated at the surface of the Li metal, enhancing their ability to regulate solvation and improve interfacial mobility, beneficial for the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs and compact Li deposition. Accordingly, Li||Li symmetric cell demonstrates &gt;500&#160;h stable cycling at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, and Li||LiFePO4 cell shows 97% capacity retention after 400 cycles in 1C. The universality of this design is further demonstrated in various negatively charged suspension electrolyte systems. Such an electrolyte design rationale can shed light on the development of advanced electrolyte systems for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;duration metal battery systems.

         <title>Element&#8208;Engineered Lithium Borate for High&#8208;Efficiency Prelithiation in Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), is proposed and synthesized based on the non&#8208;metallic element boron (B), which is ultralight, inexpensive, and free of d&#8208;orbitals. LBO exhibits an excellent initial charge specific capacity of 692 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, combined with cost&#8208;effectiveness, outstanding air stability, and strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy density&#160;of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remains a critical challenge for advancing next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. Silicon&#8208;based anodes offer significantly higher theoretical capacitites, but their practical application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), leading to substantial lithium loss and rapid full cell performance degradation. Herein, a novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), based on the ultralight, cost&#8208;effective, and d&#8208;orbital&#8208;free non&#8208;metallic element boron (B) is presented. LBO features a core&#8211;shell architecture, consisting of a crystalline Li3BO3 core encapsulated by Li2CO3 and amorphous carbon, delivering an exceptional initial charge capacity of 692 mAh g&#8722;1 and superior atmospheric stability with 70% capacity retention after 8 days of ambient exposure. When applied in SiOx||LRLO (Li&#8208;rich layered oxide) pouch cells, LBO enhances the gravimetric and volumetric energy density by 14.7% and 21.8%, respectively, while effectively suppressing the irreversible LRLO degradation caused by Li deficiency. This work introduces an element&#8208;centric design methodology for prelithiation agents, providing a promising route to propel the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Deficient Chain&#8208;Like Molecular Structure Confined Hydride Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous hydrogen&#8208;deficient LiNBH are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of LiNBH that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion.








Abstract
The practical application of LiBH4 in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) is hindered by low Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature, poor oxidative stability, and severe dendrite growth. Herein, porous [LiNBH]n with a hydrogen&#8208;deficient chain&#8208;like molecular structure are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of [LiNBH]n chains that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion. Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of [LiNBH]n chains induces the local electron localization of LiBH4 that enhances oxidative stability of LiBH4. Therefore, the Li ion conductivity of LiBH4 reaches 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LiBH4, with a voltage window of 5&#160;V. Moreover, the interaction between Li metal and [LiNBH]n chains results in in situ formation of ultrathin layer composed of Li3N and LiB alloys that hinders Li dendrites growth, leading to a critical current density value of 7.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cycling life of 100&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential of 125&#160;mV. Hence, LiCoO2|LiBH4&#8208;70LiNBH|Li cell at 0.5 C deliver a high capacity of 89.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.

         <title>A 1000 Wh Kg&#8722;1 Cathode Facilitated by In Situ Mineralized Electrolyte with Electron Potential Well for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mineralized electrolyte with Prussian blue analog electron potential wells revolutionizes aqueous zinc batteries, enabling a 1000 Wh kg&#8722;1 cathode and dendrite&#8208;free anode. This design mediates rapid iodine&#8208;bromine redox reactions, achieves multi&#8208;electron transfer, and ensures stable cycling over 6000 cycles. The breakthrough offers a scalable pathway for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan zinc batteries.








Abstract
The practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZMBs) are hindered by challenges such as low energy density and limited cycle life, which stem from the one&#8208;electron transfer at the cathode and dendrite formation at the anode. Herein, inspired by the biomineralization phenomenon in nature, an in situ mineralized electrolyte (IME) containing Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as an electron potential well is designed. This in situ mineralization strategy promotes uniform, rapid, and reversible charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, enabling the Iodine (I&#8322;) cathode to achieve a specific capacity of 286.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1 A g&#8315;&#185; and an energy density of 330.8&#160;Wh kg&#8315;&#185;. Simultaneously, the potential well facilitates the in situ recovery of Zn dendrites into active Zn2&#8314; ions, ensuring stable Zn anode cycling with a practical areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8315;2 for 1500 h. Furthermore, the mediation of iodine&#8208;bromine chemistry enables highly reversible Br&#8304;/Br&#8315; and I&#8314;/I&#8304;/I&#8315; reactions, achieving an energy density of more than 1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Additionally, an enhanced energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1 and a high energy efficiency of 86.73% over 6000 cycles are achieved. In summary, the in situ mineralization of an electron potential well in electrolyte offers a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs.

         <title>Giant Flexoelectric&#8208;Like Response via Macroscopic Symmetry Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance flexoelectricity by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameters and device structure is proposed. The centrosymmetric piezoelectric bimorph cantilever exhibits a flexoelectric coefficient of 1.47 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1, and the mirror&#8208;symmetric one with spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes achieves a record&#8208;high value of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1. This strategy can guide the design of high&#8208;performance flexoelectric devices.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity is enabled by symmetry in all materials. However, flexoelectric material application is limited by the normally low charge density produced in bulk materials. In this study, a universal strategy involving a macroscopic symmetry design is proposed to enhance the flexoelectricity. Through theoretical derivation, flexoelectricity can be improved by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameter distribution (including the piezoelectric coefficients) and device structure. As a demonstration, typical piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers (PBCs; Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag) are constructed with the two PZT&#8208;5H layers arranged in &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (mirror symmetry) and &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (centrosymmetry), to design the macroscopic symmetry and thus to tune the flexoelectricity. The theoretical predictions and experimental results show that the tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC achieves a flexoelectric coefficient (1.47 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1), 20 times higher than that of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC (7 &#215; 104 nC m&#8722;1) and conventional piezoelectric cantilevers (Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag). Furthermore, by introducing spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes, the macroscopic symmetry of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC can be transformed from mirror to centrosymmetry, yielding a giant flexoelectric coefficient of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1. This strategy offers a dimension beyond traditional approaches for understanding and enhancing flexoelectricity, paving the way for its practical application.

         <title>Topological Transformation of MXenes to Non&#8208;Van Der Waals Artificial Solids with Well&#8208;Defined Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is produced based on the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes by substitution with &#8208;S terminations and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal atoms. The resultant non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solids disclose a good structural stability, high catalytic activity, and superior adsorption capability toward iodine species, delivering good rate capabilities and cyclic stability in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (MXenes) have become an ideal platform to produce some derivatives with tunable chemical compositions and structures, possessing unique physical and chemical properties beyond their counterparts. Here, a well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is developed on the basis of the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes, which involves the substitution of &#8208;Cl with &#8208;S terminations to enlarge the interlayer spacing of MXenes and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, and Sn) atoms. After the topological transformation, the MXene layers are chemically bonded, showing a higher thermal stability up to 550&#160;&#176;C in air than that of MXenes. The resultant artificial solids with well&#8208;defined atomic metal layers exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity to I2/I&#8722; redox reaction and a strong adsorption capability toward iodine species. As a result, Zn&#8208;I2 batteries deliver a good rate performance of 104 mAh g&#8722;1 at 32 C and a long cycling stability of up to 2000 cycles at 8 C.

         <title>Biohybrid Microrobot Enteric&#8208;Coated Microcapsule for Oral Treatment of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative oral drug delivery system using piezoelectric BaTiO&#8323; nanoparticles on Enterobacter aerogenes microrobots encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microrobots can penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and target the colorectal tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor cell death through ultrasound&#8208;activated reactions while simultaneously promoting an immune response against tumors.








Abstract
The oral treatment of colorectal cancer is highly desirable due to its noninvasiveness and potential for localized drug action, yet it remains challenged by gastrointestinal barriers and limited intratumoral penetration. This study presents the first oral biohybrid microrobot system that integrates ultrasound&#8208;activated piezoelectric catalysis with bacterial therapy, achieving synergistic tumor targeting, reactive oxygen species generation, and immune activation. By leveraging Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) and BaTiO3 nanoparticles, this strategy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and metabolic remodeling. It utilizes BaTiO3 incorporated into EA (EA@BTO) microrobots, which are encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microcapsules, encapsulated in enteric microcapsules via photocurable 3D printing, protect during digestion, target tumors, penetrate mucus, and release gases. They thrive in anaerobic, acidic environments, enabling precise, responsive delivery within the intestinal tract. Once the microrobots reach the tumor, the BaTiO3 nanoparticles catalyze reduction and oxidation reactions upon ultrasound irradiation, leading to the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Notably, the consumption of lactic acid by BaTiO3 and EA alleviates the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the tumor. This promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby reducing the proportion of regulatory T cells and enhancing the population of effector T cells.

         <title>Achieving Ultrafast Monovalent ZnCl+ Ion Transport in MOF&#8208;Based Zn Ion Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte through Polyanion Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MOF&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) is developed through the polyanion strategy. Thanks to the ultrafast transport of monovalent ZnCl+ ion, the ZGBC achieves a high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a high ionic transference number of 0.873 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transport of high&#8208;valence ions is a huge challenge, such as the transport of divalent zinc ions. Herein, a polyanion strategy is proposed to decrease divalent Zn2+ to monovalent ZnCl+, realizing ultrafast ion transport in solid&#8208;state electrolyte. An amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (ZGB&#8208;MOF) is designed and constructed as the matrix for solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The ZGB&#8208;MOF matrix is obtained by the Zn2+/Ga3+ competitive coordination process, enriching O&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl polyanion clusters, nanopores and C&#9552;O/oxygen vacancies active sites. The polyanion property of Ga3+ and physical limiting domains of nanopores promote the formation of ZnCl+. Abundant C&#9552;O and oxygen vacancies provide more transport sites, decreasing transport energy barriers for ZnCl+ (only 0.12&#160;eV). Eventually, the obtained Zinc ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) achieves high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high transference number of 0.873. More importantly, the ZGBC electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window (up to 2.88&#160;V) and high charging voltage (2.4&#160;V), and achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn&#8208;metal and stabilization of cathode materials. Full cells with ZGBC electrolyte and zinc hexacyanoferrate cathode exhibit excellent cycling stability, with no capacity degradation after 5000 cycles. This discovery could trigger new waves of enthusiasm for exploring new ion transport mechanisms beyond divalent Zn2+ transport.

A homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase can be stably formed at spin&#8208;coating stage, and the synchronous phase transformation from the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase occurs at the annealing stage. Thus, a low&#8208;defect and homogeneous halide&#8208;phase WBG perovskite film is obtained. As a result, the DMI&#8208;treated wide bandgap PSCs exhibits an improved PCE and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halogen wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite materials are employed in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their continuous tunability of bandgap. However, inhomogeneous halogen phases are often observed in bromine&#8208;rich perovskite films, which restricts the performance of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and TSCs. Here, homogeneous halogen&#8208;phase perovskite is proposed to form film by a synchronous halogen&#8208;phase transformation strategy. 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, due to its stronger binding energy with lead halide (PbX2). The homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase is stable in precursor solution and at spin&#8208;coating stage. And it then synchronously transforms into a homogeneous halide&#8208;phase perovskite film at the annealing stage. Benefited from efficient carrier extraction and suppressed carrier recombination, the resulting 1.76 eV&#8208;bandgap PSC achieves a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.42% (certified 21.18%) among devices with a bandgap wider than 1.74 eV. Based on the high transmittance of semitransparent&#8208;WBG PSC, a 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSC achieves a PCE of 29.66%.

Topological Semimetal Nanowires
TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a SiO2 shell display giant magnetoresistance, coherent surface transport, Aharonov&#8208;Bohm oscillations, and various signatures of intertwined topological phases: a weak topological insulator with a pair of quantized surface Dirac cones, bulk Weyl cones, and a C2&#8208;protected pair of surface Dirac cones. The frontispiece shows the structure of a core&#8208;shell TaAs2&#8208;SiO2 nanowire with the topological phases as insets, and a micrograph of the real as&#8208;grown nanowires at the background. More details can be found in article number 2418279 by Anand Roy, Ernesto Joselevich, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts for Clean Fuel Production and Organic Synthesis: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and organic chemical transformations. Different types of halide perovskite photocatalysts and their relative efficiencies for hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents and outstanding challenges are discussed.








Abstract
The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar&#8208;driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added products, and hydrogen (H2) generation from water (H2O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long&#8208;term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for using halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

         <title>Engineering Flow&#8208;Through Hollow Fiber Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Unlocking High&#8208;Rate Gas&#8208;Phase Electrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing gas&#8208;phase electrolysis toward industrial&#8208;scale applications requires not only the development of advanced electrocatalysts but also the design of the electrodes to optimize gas&#8208;electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and facilitate efficient mass transport, thereby reinforcing gas win the electrons to promote reaction kinetics and suppress side reactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for emerging flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes.








Abstract
Designing advanced electrodes with efficient contact with gas, electrolytes, and catalysts presents significant opportunities to enhance the accessibility of concentrated gas molecules to the catalytic sites while mitigating undesirable side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which advances the gas&#8208;phase electrochemical reduction toward industrial&#8208;scale applications. Traditional planar electrodes face challenges, including limited gas solubility and restricted mass transport. Although commercial flow&#8208;by gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes can reduce mass transfer resistance by enabling direct diffusion of gas molecules to active sites, the reliance on diffusive gas flow becomes insufficient to meet the rapid consumption demands of gas reactants at high current density. Flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (HFGDEs) or hollow fiber gas penetration electrodes (HFGPEs) provide a promising solution by continuously delivering convective gas flow to active sites, resulting in enhanced mass transport and superior gas accessibility near the catalytic sites. Notably, HFGDEs have demonstrated the ability to achieve current densities exceeding multiple amperes per square centimeter in liquid electrolytes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for porous metallic HFGDEs. It highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in HFGDEs composed of various metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, Bi, Ti, and Zn), with a particular focus on their utilization in the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Finally, future research directions are discussed, underscoring the potential of porous metallic HFGDEs as a versatile and scalable electrode architecture for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Advanced Microporous Framework Membranes for Sustainable Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the latest advancements in microporous material&#8208;based membranes, focusing on their applications in hydrocarbon separation, molecular sieving, and ion separation. It highlights the innovative membrane design methods and membrane separation performance, along with current challenges and perspectives on the future directions in the field of microporous membranes.








Abstract
Advancements in membrane&#8208;based separation hinge on the design of materials that transcend conventional limitations. Microporous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), macrocycles, and porous organic cages (POCs) offer unprecedented control over pore architecture, chemical functionality, and transport properties, making them promising candidates for next&#8208;generation membrane technologies. The well&#8208;defined and tunable micropores provide a pathway to directly address the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off inherent in conventional polymer membranes. Here, this review explores the latest advancements in these four representative microporous membranes, emphasizing their breakthroughs in hydrocarbon separation, liquid&#8208;phase molecular sieving, and ion&#8208;selective transport, particularly focusing on their structure&#8208;performance relationships. While their tailored structures enable exceptional performance, practical adoption requires overcoming hurdles in scalability, durability, and compatibility with industrial processes. By offering insights into membrane structure optimization and innovative design strategies, this review provides a roadmap for advancing microporous membranes from laboratory innovation to real&#8208;world implementation, ultimately supporting global sustainability goals through energy&#8208;efficient separation processes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages, applications, challenges, and prospects of current collectors have been comprehensively reviewed, covering various types of metal current collectors, carbonaceous current collectors, conductive polymer current collectors, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid current collectors. The high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;structured, and functionalized novel current collectors play a crucial role in advancing batteries with high performance, safety, and intelligence for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.









Abstract
The rapid advancement of rechargeable batteries is hindered by insufficient energy density, limited design flexibility, and safety concerns, which pose significant challenges to their practical application. This review summarizes the crucial yet often overlooked role of current collectors in addressing these challenges. Recent progress across four types of current collectors, deriving from metal foils, carbonaceous substrates, conductive polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids is systematically analyzed. Metal foils, as the most widely used current collectors, now face challenges including corrosion susceptibility and high volumetric density. Carbonaceous and polymer&#8208;based alternatives offer lightweight design and structural flexibility, but face limitations in conductivity and scalable production. Notably, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid current collectors, leveraging material engineering and hierarchical design, offer a promising avenue to enhance battery safety and intelligence. Further, potential directions for current collector development, emphasizing 1) enhanced battery performance, 2) multiscale structural adaptability, and 3) integrated multifunctional design, providing prospective insights for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices are outlined.

Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion devices are uniquely suited for self&#8208;driven physiological information monitoring and powering human&#8211;computer interaction systems. These devices based on micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.








Abstract
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self&#8208;powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction. Recently, researchers have increasingly integrated inorganic dielectric materials (IDMs) and micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures into various types of NGs (i.e., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and flexoelectric NGs). This strategy significantly enhances the electrical performance, enabling near&#8208;theoretical energy harvesting capability and precise multiple physiological information detection. However, because micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured IDMs function differently in each type of NG, numerous studies have focused on a single NG type and lack a unified perspective on their role across all types of biomechanical energy NGs. In this review, from an overall theoretical root of NGs, the performance enhancement mechanisms and effects of designs of IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures of various kinds of biomechanical energy NGs are systematically summarized. Next, advanced applications in human energy scavenging and physiological signal sensing are delved into. Finally, challenges and rational guidelines for designing future devices are discussed. This work provides researchers with in&#8208;depth insight into the development of high&#8208;performance personalized high&#8208;entropy power supplies and sensor networks via biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technologies based on IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Patterned Delivery of Chemical Signals From 3D&#8208;Printed Picoliter Droplet Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks have been fabricated that control gene expression in bacterial populations by releasing chemical signals with precise spatial definition and high temporal resolution. This system of effector release is widely applicable, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine.









Abstract
Synthetic cells, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, can be engineered to detect and release chemical signals to control target cell behavior. However, control over the targeting of cell populations is limited due to poor spatial or temporal resolution and the inability of synthetic cells to deliver patterned signals. Here, 3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks are described that direct gene expression in underlying bacterial populations by patterned release of a chemical signal with temporal control. Shrinkage of the droplet networks prior to use achieves spatial control over gene expression with &#8776;50 &#181;m resolution. Ways to store chemical signals in the droplet networks and to activate release at controlled points in time are also demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the spatially&#8208;controlled delivery system can regulate competition between bacteria by inducing the patterned expression of toxic bacteriocins. This system provides the groundwork for the use of picoliter droplet networks in fundamental biology and in medicine in applications that require the controlled formation of chemical gradients (i.e., for the purpose of local control of gene expression) within a target group of cells.

         <title>A Microgel&#8211;Hydrogel Hybrid for Functional Compensation and Mechanical Stability in 3D Printed Cell&#8208;Dense Vascularized Liver Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed&#160;to construct a multiscale vascular network through embedded bioprinting and guided vascular morphogenesis. With a high density of hepatocytes, a bioengineered thick vascularized liver tissue model achieves a rapid and&#160;promising functional compensation in rats with 85% hepatectomy via direct vascular integration, providing a theraputi paradigm for physiological&#8208;related engineered tissue in animals with acute disease.








Abstract
3D bioprinting of liver tissue with high cell density (HCD) shows great promise for restoring function in cases of acute liver failure, where a substantial number of functional cells are required to perform essential physiological tasks. Direct vascular anastomosis is critical for the successful implantation of these bioprinted vascularized tissues into the host vasculature, allowing for rapid functional compensation and addressing various acute conditions. However, conventional hydrogels used to encapsulate high&#8208;density cells often lack the mechanical properties needed to withstand the shear forces of physiological blood flow, often resulting in implantation failure. In this study, a heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed to carry HCD hepatocytes and support the embedded bioprinting of hierarchical vascular structures. By optimizing the ratio of microgel to biomacromolecule, the covalently crosslinked network offers mechanical integrity and enables&#160;direct vascular anastomosis, ensuring efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange. The bioprinted thick, vascularized constructs, containing HCD hepatocytes, are successfully implanted in rats after 85% hepatectomy, leading to swift functional recovery and prolonged survival. This study presents a strategy to enhance regenerative therapy outcomes through advanced bioprinting and vascular integration techniques.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Magnetic Shape&#8208;Morphing System for Complex 3D Transformations with Broad Reconfigurability in 3D Displays and Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulating skin&#8208;texturing capabilities of cephalopods, a magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platform (MMP) is developed to enable systems that reversibly modulate their morphology and stiffness. The MMP, consisting of polymer composites embedded with liquid metal droplets and ferromagnetic particles, achieves complex and sophisticated 3D configurations through thermo&#8208;magnetic stimuli under programmed magnetization profiles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations suggest potential applications in 3D displays and soft robotics.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing systems capable of actively achieving diverse three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;configurations are essential for advancements in 3D electronics and soft robotics. However, current shape&#8208;morphing technologies encounter challenges such as iterative shape reconfiguration with high geometrical complexity, mechanical stability, and slow response times. Inspired by the 3D skin texturing abilities of cephalopods, 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems are introduced, enabling reversible and continuous transformation with a broad range of complex reconfigurable shapes. This is achieved through thermo&#8208;magnetoactive actuation, guided by magnetization profiles created via a 3D magnetic encoding strategy. The system leverages magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platforms (MMPs) built with a composite containing elastomer mixed with low melting point alloy (LMPA) particles comprising ferromagnetic particles. The MMP can produce intricate, robust 3D configurations using multimodal magnetic actuation facilitated by tunable stiffness and magnetoactive reconfigurability. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations of 3D visio&#8208;tactile displays and light&#8208;responsive flower robots highlight the potential of bioinspired 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems, suggesting promising applications in 3D electronics, soft robotics, and visio&#8208;haptic human interfacing.

         <title>Intertwined Topological Phases in TaAs2 Nanowires with Giant Magnetoresistance and Quantum Coherent Surface Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of topological semimetal TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a thin SiO2 shell unravel a richness of intertwined topological phases manifested by their magnetotransport features: A near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, strong expressions of topologically nontrivial surface transport, giant magnetoresistance with direction&#8208;dependent sign reversal, chiral anomaly, and a unique double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations.








Abstract
Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi&#8208;1D geometry and large surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal&#8208;line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2&#8208;protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field&#8208;induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enable to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically nontrivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction&#8208;dependent giant positive, and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The SiO2&#8208;encapsulated TaAs2 NWs show room&#8208;temperature conductivity up to 15 times higher than bulk TaAs2. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength Red&#8208;Shift Regulating Strategy of Carbon Dots Composites via the Effective Conjugated Domain and the Hydrogen Bonding Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses a structurally fixed conjugation molecule as a precursor. It efficiently forms carbon core states of carbon dots. This approach optimizes the control over the conjugated domain size of the carbon core. It also significantly enhances the synthetic efficiency of CDs and the tunability of the optical properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold significant potential for applications in lighting, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, regulating RTP emission wavelengths, especially shifting into the red spectral region, remains challenging due to the spin&#8208;forbidden transitions of triplet&#8208;state excitons and non&#8208;radiative decay. To address this issue, carbon dots (CDs) with different conjugated domain sizes and phosphorescent potential are designed and synthesized. The CDs are then encapsulated in polyacrylamide (PAM), resulting in multicolored RTP emission ranging from cyan to red (465&#8211;635 nm), with cyan and red phosphorescence exceeding 10 s and 2 s, respectively. The mechanism suggests that the enhanced conjugation effect leads to energy level splitting and strengthened electron coupling, which lowers the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons, ultimately causing a redshift in the phosphorescent emission wavelength. Meanwhile, the introduction of hydrogen bonding protects the excited state of the electrons, suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, and induces RTP in the CDs. These materials are applied in multi&#8208;level information encryption and time&#8208;delayed LED illumination, offering novel strategies for high&#8208;security technologies and advanced optical devices.

Organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are promising for flexible, low&#8208;cost, and biocompatible electronics. However, conventional planar OTFTs are hindered by the large channel length limiting the transconductance and switching frequencies. Vertical OTFTs, particularly organic permeable&#8208;base transistors (OPBTs), address these challenges with short channel lengths defined by the layer thickness. While n&#8208;type OPBTs have advanced significantly, p&#8208;type OPBTs face challenges such as lower transmission, higher leakage currents, and unreliable fabrication processes. This work introduces a wafer&#8208;scale method for fabricating p&#8208;type OPBTs using electrochemical anodization of the base electrode. The anodization process applied directly atop the organic semiconductor, preserves electrical properties while suppressing base leakage. The resulting anodized OPBTs exhibit high&#8208;performance characteristics, including an on&#8208;current density of 301 mAcm&#8722;2, low leakage current of 4.32 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A, maximum transmission of 99.9999%, and a maximum current gain of 1.89 &#215; 106&#8212;a 100,000&#8208;fold improvement over prior methods. Small signal analysis reveals a cutoff frequency of 1.49 MHz, with a voltage&#8208;normalized cutoff frequency of 0.54 MHzV&#8722;1. Large&#8208;scale arrays show 96.3% fabrication yield and excellent uniformity. Complementary inverters integrating n&#8208; and p&#8208;type OPBTs exhibit superior switching, highlighting the potential of anodized OPBTs for advanced applications in displays and&#160;circuits.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Composite Structural Design for the Conversion of Hydroxyl&#8208;Anchored Bonds Obtains High Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The detailed mechanisms governing the adsorption dynamics between SAMs and ITO delve into and promote homogeneous and stable SAMs film by converting the originally weak bonds anchored through physical interactions into strong bonds, helping PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 26.37%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) serve as the hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, yet their instability on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates poses a challenge in practical. The typical SAMs are susceptible to solvents during the perovskite layer deposition process which can result in being washed or dislodged, thereby impeding the formation of a dense SAM. Here, a novel guanidine&#8208;modified polyurethane siloxane elastomers is synthesized to enhance the anchoring capability of SAMs on ITO, which exhibits strong interactions with [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) SAMs, to co&#8208;construct a self&#8208;assembled composite structure (SACS). By utilizing this anchor strategy, the weakly bonded MeO&#8208;2PACz adhering to ITO can be converted into a strongly bonded form, thereby curtailing the migration of MeO&#8208;2PACz on the ITO surface during the spin&#8208;coating process, as well as inhibiting shedding that may occur due to solvent washing during the device preparation process. SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS&#8208;based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymer Monolayer Transistors with Sub&#8208;20 nm Channel Lengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies, polymer monolayer transistors with a channel length of 18 nm are demonstrated, which exhibit good operational stability and reliability with the on&#8208;state current density of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A mm&#8722;1 and the intrinsic gate delay of 0.79 ps. Moreover, the short channel effect is investigated by varying the dielectric thickness.








Abstract
The scaling strategy is widely used to achieve much improved performance and reduced cost in a single chip with more devices for field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Si and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D materials. However, the downscaling of polymer FETs with high performance has not been achieved. Here both the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies are employed, and demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polymer monolayer FET, where the shortest channel length (L) of 18&#160;nm is achieved that is comparable to the smallest technology node (&#8776;20&#160;nm) for planar Si FETs. Such short&#8208;channel FETs, with good operational stability and reliability, exhibit only slightly lower field&#8208;effect mobility than the device with micrometer&#8208;long channel, but the on&#8208;state current density reaches 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A &#181;m&#8722;1. More importantly, a high intrinsic gate delay of 0.79&#160;ps is achieved, while maintaining the on/off current ratio up to 109. Additionally, by increasing the thickness of gate dielectric a remarkable short channel effect is observed, which is in excellent agreement with natural scale length evaluated by the Scale Length Theory.

         <title>In Situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation of Peptides Into Droplets Targeting Membraneless Organelles for Enhanced Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of peptides in living cells is developed for enhancing cancer chemotherapy through targeting membraneless organelle stress granules. The peptide underwent sulfatase&#8208;induced phase separation into droplets upon sulfate hydrolysis. Decorated with protein ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets coacervated with stress granules, thereby enhancing cancer chemotherapy with sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids into membraneless organelles (MLOs) plays a critical role in sustaining fundamental physiological processes. However, creating artificial coacervate droplets in living cells from exogenous molecules and modulating the functions of MLOs remain challenging. To address this concern, here we reported enzyme&#8208;induced in situ phase separation of peptides into droplets targeting MLO stress granule (SG) for enhanced cancer chemotherapy. The peptide YSO4F containing two sulfated tyrosine residues undergoes sulfatase&#8208;responsive LLPS into droplets. Cellular studies confirm in situ phase separation of YSO4F selectively in sulfatase&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. By integrating with appropriate ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets d&#8208;YF&#8208;LSG coacervate with SGs driven by association between the ligand with SG key component protein G3BP2. Mechanistic studies illustrate that the in situ&#8208;formed droplets enhance the cytotoxicity of sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, animal experiments confirm that administration of the in situ&#8208;formed droplets with sorafenib significantly inhibits tumor growth in murine models bearing tumors, accompanied by an excellent biosafety profile. The findings in this study&#160;elucidate an innovative approach for in situ formulation of coacervate droplets within tumor cells and a new material for targeting membraneless organelles, thus providing a promising new strategy for disease organelle&#8208;targeted therapy in the future.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Textile&#8208;Based Highly Sensitive and Water&#8208;Resistant Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amplified micro&#8208;deformation strategy is proposed to develop a 3D fabric&#8208;based F&#8208;TENG with 3D conductive PPy network and a water&#8208;resistant WPU layer. The device enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time physiological monitoring, maintains stable performance in both in vivo and skin surface wet conditions, and exhibits excellent antibacterial properties. F&#8208;TENG is expected to achieve the application of integrated diagnosis and treatment.









Abstract
The demand for real&#8208;time physiological monitoring drives innovation in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). TENGs offer promise for real&#8208;time dynamic monitoring, but they are often complicated to manufacture, have low sensitivity, and are easily disturbed by ambient humidity. Herein, a fabric&#8208;based integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is developed, employing waterborne polyurethane (WPU) as both a water&#8208;resistant encapsulation and friction layer, and polypyrrole (PPy) as a friction and conductive layer. This design simplifies the fabrication process while simultaneously improving the device's resistance to environmental factors. The micro&#8208;filament structure enables localized contact&#8208;separation during deformation, initiating the triboelectric effect, while the 3D architecture amplifies local strain, further enhancing sensitivity to weak signals. F&#8208;TENG demonstrates effective voltage output during carotid and respiratory monitoring, highlighting its capability to detect subtle physiological signals. Furthermore, F&#8208;TENG maintains stable performance under humid conditions, retaining 78.78% of its output voltage as relative humidity increased from 20% to 80%. When implants in the moist environment of a rat's leg, F&#8208;TENG exhibits a notable output of 21&#160;V. In addition, the inherent antibacterial properties of F&#8208;TENG further enhance its application potential. These findings position F&#8208;TENG as a robust and versatile platform for dynamic monitoring, wearable electronics, and integrated diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Rational Regulation of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Active Layer via Trimer&#8208;Induced Pre&#8208;Swelling Strategy for Efficient and Robust Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>

Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology is combined with a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy by incorporating a 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) into the buried D18 donor layer to construct thick&#8208;film OSCs. A best performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability is achieved in TIP devices, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered intensifying attention due to their compatibility with commercial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing technology for the large&#8208;scale continuous fabrication process. However, due to the uncontrollable donor/acceptor (D/A) arrangement in thick&#8208;film condition, the restricted exciton splitting and severe carrier traps significantly impede the photovoltaic performance and operability. Herein, combined with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology, a twisted 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) is synthesized to develop a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy, where the BTT&#8208;Out is incorporated into the buried D18 donor layer to enable the fabrication of thick&#8208;film OSCs. The integrated approach characterizations reveal that the exceptional configuration and spontaneous self&#8208;organization behavior of BTT&#8208;Out trimer could pre&#8208;swell the D18 network to facilitate the acceptor's infiltration and accelerate the formation of D/A interfaces. This enhancement triggers the elevated polarons formation with amplified hole&#8208;transfer kinetics, which is essential for the augmented exciton splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the regulated swelling process can initiate the favorable self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO acceptors, which would ameliorate carrier transport channels and mitigate carrier traps. As a result, the TIP&#8208;modified thin&#8208;film OSC devices achieve the champion performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Stabilization of Noble Metal Single Atoms: Advancing Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Output in Zinc&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy, demonstrating that the (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate can accommodate more Ru single atoms than the traditional low&#8208;entropy single oxides such as CeO2, and achieve excellent performance in ammonia electrosynthesis and energy output of zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries.








Abstract
Noble metal single atoms (NMSA) offer exceptional atom utilization and catalytic activity but face challenges like limited stability, low atomic loading, and complex synthesis. This study presents an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy to stabilize Ru single atoms (SA) on a (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate (Ru&#945;%&#8208;HEO). Due to their defect&#8208;rich structure and significant lattice distortion, HEO substrates can accommodate and stabilize more Ru SA than traditional low&#8208;entropy oxides (LEO) like CeO2. This strategy is also effective for achieving high loadings&#160;of other NMSAs, such as Pd and Pt. Ru3%&#8208;HEO, as an electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction, achieves a high ammonia yield (5.79 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.3%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru3%&#8208;HEO exhibits favorable thermodynamics for nitrate reduction, with a lower energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of first hydrogenation (*NO + H+ + e&#8315; &#8594; *NOH) and stronger intermediates adsorption compared to RuO2, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. As a cathode material in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery, Ru3%&#8208;HEO demonstrates a high NH3 yield rate (1.11 mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and FE value (93.4%). This study provides an efficient strategy to produce stable and high&#8208;loading SA using high&#8208;entropy materials, showcasing their broad applicability in advanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton&#8208;Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High&#8208;Efficient and High&#8208;Contrast Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI&#8208;guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.








Abstract
Although photoluminescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time&#8208;resolved imaging (TRI)&#8208;guided PDT with long&#8208;lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI&#8208;guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long&#8208;wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep&#8208;seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostic approaches.

Light&#8208;induced membraneless organelles (MLOs) are formed in artificial cells upon light irradiation. The enrichment of iNOS+ in MLOs increases the production rate of NO 3.2 times of that without MLOs. Artificial cells containing light&#8208;induced MLOs are utilized to treat melanoma efficiently.









Abstract
Membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation exhibit diverse important biofunctions in cells. The construction of artificial cells containing MLOs with enhanced complexity and functions is still challenging. Here a light&#8208;responsive protein, Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs, is designed and purified to form MLOs upon light (488&#160;nm) irradiation. They are capable of rapidly recruiting positively charged inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS+) from surroundings to regulate its activity for NO production. NO&#8208;artificial cells are constructed by encapsulating Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs and iNOS+ into giant unilamellar vesicles, which are capable of rapid production of NO with high concentration due to the formation of MLOs upon light irradiation. NO&#8208;artificial cells are confirmed to possess the ability for melanoma tumor therapy in mice. These findings provide an efficient method for remotely regulating enzyme activity inside artificial cells, paving the path to build more sophisticated artificial cells for their biomedical applications.

         <title>Shape Memory Networks With Tunable Self&#8208;Stiffening Kinetics Enabled by Polymer Melting&#8208;Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape recovery of traditional shape memory polymers (SMPs) is often accompanied by a monotonic decrease in mechanical stiffness, thereby impacting their practical applications. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to construct the self&#8208;stiffening SMP triggered by single thermal stimulus by harnessing polymer melting&#8208;recrystallization. Conceptual application of self&#8208;stiffening SMP as a shape memory stent with self&#8208;enhancing supporting function is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are deformable materials capable of recovering from a programmed temporary shape to a permanent shape under specific stimuli. However, shape recovery of SMPs is often accompanied by the evolution of materials from a stiff to soft state, leading to a significant decrease in strength/modulus and thereby impacting their practical applications. Although some attempts are made to pursue the SMPs with self&#8208;stiffening capability after shape recovery, the modulus increase ratio is much limited. Inspired by the recrystallization process of CaCO3 during crab molting, a novel and universal strategy is developed to construct water&#8208;free self&#8208;stiffening SMPs by using a single thermal stimulus through harnessing the polymer melting&#8208;recrystallization. The shape recovery is achieved through the melting of polymer primary crystals, followed by the self&#8208;stiffening via polymer recrystallization at the same recovery temperature, in which the modulus increase rate and ratio can be programmed in a wide range. Additionally, conceptual applications of these self&#8208;stiffening SMPs as artificial stents with self&#8208;enhancing supporting function are successfully demonstrated. This work is believed to provide new insights for developing the advanced shape memory devices.

         <title>Organic Solar Cell with Efficiency of 20.49% Enabled by Solid Additive and Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a feasible solid additive strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells. The 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN)&#8208;treated device owned enhanced molecular crystallinity, more efficient exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination, and more favorable morphology. Record efficiency of 20.22% and 20.49% are obtained in binary and ternary devices processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent. NBN is applicable to multiple efficient systems.








Abstract
Recently, benzene&#8208;based solid additives (BSAs) have emerged as pivotal components in modulating the morphology of the blend film in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, since almost all substituents on BSAs are weak electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and contain halogen atoms, the study of BSAs with non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has received little attention. Herein, an additive strategy is proposed, involving the incorporation of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the benzene ring. An effective BSA, 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN), is selected to boost the efficiency of devices. The results demonstrate that the NBN&#8208;treated device exhibits enhanced light absorption, superior charge transport performance, mitigated charge recombination, and more optimal morphology compared to the additive&#8208;free OSC. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based binary device and D18:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based ternary OSC processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent achieved outstanding efficiencies of 20.22% and 20.49%, respectively. Furthermore, the universality of NBN is also confirmed in different active layer systems. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the introduction of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;absorbing moieties on the benzene ring is a promising approach to design BSAs, which can tune the film morphology and achieve highly efficient devices, and has certain guiding significance for the development of BSAs.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Quantitative Characterization of Nanofiltration Membrane Pore Orientation for Enhanced Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ real&#8208;time fluorescence technique enables the quantitative monitoring of pore arrangement in nanofiltration membranes and provides design guidance. The membrane is guided to achieve a Mg2+/Li+ separation factor of 15.55 and a permeate flux of 35.85 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 through optimization of the membrane structure.








Abstract
Nanofiltration membranes hold great promise for ion separation but often suffer from a trade&#8208;off between selectivity and flux, limiting their use in precise separation processes. A key challenge is achieving precise control over pore orientation, as existing methods fail to provide real&#8208;time, quantitative insights for optimizing membrane structure and performance. To address this, an innovative in situ, real&#8208;time quantitative technique is developed that links pore alignment directly to separation efficiency. Using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as a model pore&#8208;forming compound, fluorescent labeling enables continuous monitoring of pore orientation and distribution during membrane fabrication. This method enables the capture of the complete distribution of pore orientation across the entire membrane surface, allowing for precise adjustments in membrane design. This approach provides the real&#8208;time quantification of pore alignment, facilitating the design of NF membranes with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability. The optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional Mg2+/Li+ separation efficiency, with a separation factor of 15.55 and permeance of 35.85 L m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, representing a significant step forward in high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes with broad applications in resource recovery, environmental remediation, and water treatment.

         <title>Ultrapure Graphite from Solid Refining</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity graphite serves as a fundamental material for scientific research and technological applications. Here, an effective solid refining process is developed utilizing the nickel (Ni) atomic lattice to eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic impurities, producing ultrapure graphite. The resultant graphite exhibits the highest elemental, structural, and doping purity among all the known natural and artificial graphite, enabling its excellent transport properties.








Abstract
Graphite has sparked extensive quantum physical discoveries and demonstrated numerous cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, existing graphite typically contains considerable impurities, and effective purification is still lacking. Here, a solid refining purification method is reported for obtaining ultrapure graphite. Through this design, impurities are filtered by the atomic lattice of a solid&#8208;state nickel (Ni). Suitable absorption, diffusion, and precipitation energy barriers are utilized in this method, allowing only carbon (C) atoms to effectively migrate through the Ni lattice to form high&#8208;quality graphite. The obtained ultrapure graphite shows the lowest elemental impurity density (&lt;10 parts per million (ppm), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the best available graphite), the highest structural purity (&lt;0.2 parts per billion (ppb) of in&#8208;plane structural defect density and &gt;99% Bernal stacking), and the highest doping purity (carrier doping density &lt;2.0 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2). Such superior purity of graphite facilitates the all&#8208;integer visible Landau levels and the ultralow quantum transition magnetic field in the fabricated graphene device. This solid refinement technique should inspire the purification of various layered crystals, leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the development of advanced applications.

Suitable absorption, diffusion, and precipitation energy barriers are utilized in this method, allowing only carbon (C) atoms to effectively migrate through the Ni lattice to form high-quality graphite. The obtained ultrapure graphite shows the lowest elemental impurity density (&amp;lt;10 parts per million (ppm), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the best available graphite), the highest structural purity (&amp;lt;0.2 parts per billion (ppb) of in-plane structural defect density and &amp;gt;99% Bernal stacking), and the highest doping purity (carrier doping density &amp;lt;2.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Such superior purity of graphite facilitates the all-integer visible Landau levels and the ultralow quantum transition magnetic field in the fabricated graphene device. This solid refinement technique should inspire the purification of various layered crystals, leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the development of advanced applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interphasial Chemistry Design for Seamless Lithium Deposition in Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) to enhance interfacial stabilization in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs). This ICM enhances charge separation, builds stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), and inhibits dendritic growth by guiding lithium lateral deposition through ionic nano&#8208;channels. Therefore, this design achieves exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.82%) in Li||Cu cells and long&#8208;term stability (80.72% capacity retention over 100 cycles) in Li||NCM811 cells, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, safe battery systems.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) are promising due to ultrahigh energy density, reduced manufacturing costs, and enhanced safety through active lithium elimination. However, their practical implementation remains challenged by unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the resulting rapid active species depletion. Herein, an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) is designed, featuring uniformly distributed rigid benzenesulfonimide anionic groups and flexible lithiophilic groups containing ether oxygen groups. The constrained benzenesulfonimide anions enable exceptional charge separation and reduced spatial resistance, boosting lithium&#8208;ion mobility, while the integrated lithophilic network directs lateral lithium deposition through ionic nanochannels. This ICM layer effectively promotes the enrichment of anions at the interface and constructs stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI). Meanwhile, ICM layers with electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conducting properties can further prevent side reactions, and suppress dendritic Li growth acting as a natural shield, resulting in seamless lithium deposition. Specifically, the Li||Cu coin cells with ICM achieve 99.82% Coulombic efficiency. The AFLMBs assembled with ICM&#8208;coated copper foil (ICM Cu) and NCM811 deliver an energy density of 495&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with 80.72% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The interphasial chemistry design strategy provides insights into the precise interfacial engineering to realize high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety battery systems and facilitates their development for practical applications.

         <title>Enhancing Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Lifetimes in Molecular Semiconductors by Designing Intramolecular Dipole Orientations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record spin lifetime of 106 &#181;s at room temperature has been observed in reg&#8208;PAzE with a regular dipole orientation. Integrated theoretical and experimental results reveal that the extended spin lifetime arises from variations in the hyperfine interaction strength induced by intramolecular dipole orientations. The findings will provide valuable insights for designing molecular materials with long spin lifetimes.








Abstract
In spintronics, achieving long spin lifetimes, particularly at room temperature (RT), is a key objective for spin transport materials. Molecular semiconductors (MSCs), with their inherently weak spin relaxation mechanisms, have emerged as promising candidates for realizing long RT spin lifetimes. However, effective strategies to suppress spin relaxation through the design of molecular structures in MSCs are still not well understood, and as a result, spin lifetimes remain limited (&#8776; 10&#8208;&#181;s level at RT). In this study, the impact of intramolecular dipole orientations on spin lifetimes in MSCs has been explored for the first time. Both theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that dipole orientation influences the hyperfine interaction (HFI) effect (a main causation for spin relaxation), and thus, spin lifetime. By adjusting dipole arrangements through molecular design, it is demonstrated that the poly(2,6&#8208;azuleneethynylene) with a regular dipole orientation served to reduce the HFI strength and ultimately extended the spin lifetime to 106 &#181;s in a spintronic device, much higher than that of the random arrangement, setting a new RT record. This work provides new insights into the spin relaxation mechanism and offers a valuable strategy for extending spin lifetimes in MSCs for future RT spintronic applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;side Interfacial Engineering of Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient and Operationally Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;side interfacial engineering of the hole transport layer (HTL) is presented for lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot solar cells. This strategy achieves a record efficiency of 14.28% by using classic P3HT as HTL and exhibits exceptional stability with unencapsulated devices retaining 90% initial efficiency for over 520 hours at maximum power point in ambient air, doubling the previous best 260 hours.








Abstract
Although lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells demonstrate excellent storage stability under ambient conditions, the operational stability is still rather poor for devices based on both organic or inorganic hole transport layer (HTL), seriously limiting their practical applications. In this work, it is find that both the CQD/polymer HTL bottom interface and the polymer HTL/electrode top interface are critical factors limiting device performance and operational stability. By proposing a double&#8208;side interfacial engineering strategy to achieve surface energy matching and energy level grading, a high efficiency of 14.28% is realized using the classic P3HT HTL material, which is the highest reported efficiency for PbS CQD solar cells with organic HTLs. More importantly, the unencapsulated device can maintain 90% of its initial power (T90) after &#8776;520 hours at the maximum power point (MPP) in ambient air, far exceeding the highest value previously reported in the literature (260 hours). This work provides new insights into the development of stable CQD&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Evolving Structured Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic system mimics essential functions of living cells&#8212;migration, division, and reconfiguration&#8212;by encapsulation of active magnetic particles within a nanoparticle&#8212;surfactant membrane. This membrane preserves its shape after deformations, which can be tuned with surfactant concentrations. The resulting biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive material paves the way for autonomous synthetic machines.








Abstract
Migration, division, and reconfiguration &#8211; functions essential to living systems &#8211; are driven by active processes. Developing synthetic mimics is an outstanding challenge. Lipid bilayers that bound natural systems are locally deformed by active species, e.g., microtubules, but the resulting non&#8208;equilibrium shapes relax when active species motion ceases, and the shape changes lack immediate control. A fully synthetic system is described, driven by active particles encapsulated by a reconfigurable nanoparticle&#8208;surfactant membrane that undergoes shape fluctuations reminiscent of living cells. These shape changes are preserved after particle activity stops. Surfactant concentration tunes the interfacial tension over three orders of magnitude, making on&#8208;demand shape evolution possible. Directional migration, division, and reconfiguration across multiple scales are possible, leading to a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials, paving the way for autonomous synthetic machines.

         <title>Golden Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Selectively Boosting Oxygen Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) are achieved by taking full advantage of the intrinsically isolated Bi atoms in fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode oxygen reduction and anode methanol oxidation electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger a direct methanol fuel cell with high power density.








Abstract
Engineering electrocatalysts at a single&#8208;atomic site can enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic activity, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic active centers to simultaneously achieve high catalytic selectivity and stability. Herein, the atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) based on fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes is presented, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode and anode electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The octahedral PdAu1 SAA exhibits ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 5.37 A mgPd + Au&#8722;1 without noticeable decay for 12&#160;0000 cycles toward oxygen reduction. While PdAu1 SAA is inactive for methanol oxidation, PtAu1 SAA exhibits an ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 28.59 A mgPt + Au&#8722;1. The selective electrocatalysts drive a practical DMFC with a high&#8208;power density of 155.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the desired regulation of selectivity via reducing the energy barrier for potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS) of *OH to H2O and *HCOO to CO2. This work provides a general strategy to engineer multimetallic alloys at the atomic level, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co&#8211;Ru Dimer Catalyst Boosts Conversion of Polysulfides toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co&#8722;Ru dimer catalyst synthesized by a confined pyrolysis strategy shows the orbital coupling effect derived from the atomic pair, which could reduce energy barrier of lithium polysulfides conversion and Li2S dissociation, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics and achieving the enhanced Li&#8722;S battery performance.








Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox reaction in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries triggers the development of highly active electrocatalysts for accelerating the polysulfides conversion kinetics. Rational design of catalysts with satisfactory active sites and high atom utilization toward multistep sulfur&#8208;based conversion is much desired but remains challenging. Here, it is shown that the well&#8208;designed Co&#8722;Ru dimer sites confined on carbon matrix could effectively manipulate the sulfur&#8208;involved conversion reactions and thus improve Li&#8722;S batteries performance. The orbital coupling of Co&#8722;Ru dimer induces the orbital regulation for the atomic pair, resulting the favored lithium polysulfides adsorption strength and lowed conversion energy barrier, as confirmed by systematic electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculation. Besides, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru from Co&#8211;Ru moiety also accelerates the Li2S dissociation reaction. Taken together, the as&#8208;constructed Co&#8211;Ru dimer sites render the Li&#8722;S battery with excellent performance, delivering energy density of 468&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 of total assembled pouch cell. This study offers a rational design of catalysts for boosting the catalytic performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Phagocytosis&#8208;Activating Nanocomplex Orchestrates Macrophage&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt, is designed to enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated tumor cell engulfment by modulating both the pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;phagocytic signals. Comprising a PAMAM derivative to induce calreticulin exposure and an RNAi to inhibit CD47 expression, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt effectively delays tumor growth and prolongs survival in mice, offering a potent strategy to potentiate macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.









Abstract
The phagocytosis of macrophages to tumor cells represents an alluring strategy for cancer immunotherapy; however, its effectiveness is largely hindered by the detrimental upregulation of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals and insufficient expression of pro&#8208;phagocytic signals of tumor cells. Here, a pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed to promote the macrophage engulfment of tumor cells through concurrent modulation of both the &#8220;eat me&#8221; and &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signals. The nanocomplex MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is formed by complexing a synthetic PAMAM derivative (G4P&#8211;C7A) that is capable of intrinsically inducing the exposure of calreticulin (CALR, a crucial pro&#8208;phagocytic protein) and a small inference RNA that can inhibit the expression of CD47 (a primary anti&#8208;phagocytic protein). MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt can significantly delay tumor growth and prolong the survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible hematopoietic toxicity in multiple murine colorectal cancer models. Furthermore, the pro&#8208;phagocytic capacity of MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is validated in the patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid model. Collectively, the phagocytosis&#8208;promoting nanocomplex provides a simple and potent strategy for boosting macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Cation Synergistic Regulation of Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Passivation Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur&#8208;hybridized aniline&#8208;like molecule thiomorpholine (SMOR) forms n = 1 2D perovskite and is preferred to transfer into 1D perovskite instead of high n&#8208;valued 2D perovskite after aging. Due to larger formation energy, chlorine anion is better than iodine anion to accelerate the formation of 1D phase. The PCE of the SMOR&#8208;based 1D/3D perovskite passivated device reaches 25.5% and shows T90 lifetime over 1000 h at 85&#176;C without encapsulation.









Abstract
Mixing 2D and 3D perovskite together is an effective strategy to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This strategy has been widely used in many recent works. Typically, 2D layer is formed by introducing 2D spacer onto 3D surfaces through in situ intercalation reaction. However, this intercalation may not stop after the 2D layer is formed. Progressive migration of 2D spacer into 3D bulk leads to increased n&#8208;values of 2D phases and deviation from optimized structural design. The high n&#8208;value 2D perovskite is less stable than the low n&#8208;value 2D perovskite and may be prone to degradation under external stresses. Here, a heteroatom ammonium ligand, thiomorpholine (SMOR) is found, which can effectively passivate the perovskite surface, and form a 1D phase or 2D phase depending on cation to anion ratio and the type of anions. Due to lower formation energy at 1:1 cation to anion ratio, 1D phase can prevent the formation of high&#8208;n&#8208;value 2D phase and show excellent thermal stability. The passivation of SMOR&#8208;based 1D perovskite boosts the device efficiency to 25.6% (certified 24.7%). More importantly, the unpackaged device can maintain &gt;80% of its initial efficiency after stable operation at 85 &#176;C for 1000 h.

         <title>Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Trifluorotoluylation Ionic Liquids for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes molecular design strategies to develop trifluorotoluylation ILs that enable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The designed ILs greatly enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte and effectively suppress the dissolution of transition metal ions, facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich interfacial layer on the lithium anode, promoting uniform distribution of Li+ and regular deposition of lithium.








Abstract
The practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes is hindered by lithium dendrite formation and poor oxidation stability, which reduce the cycle life and energy density of the battery. Here, taking advantage of the ionic liquids&#8217; high ionic interactions and structural flexibility in forming an optimized electrode/electrolyte interface, a pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids with trifluorotoluylation cationic segment is designed and developed. The oxidation of anions in the electrolytes is induced to form a robust inorganic LiF&#8208;rich interphase at the cathode, thereby effectively achieving high oxidation stability and suppressing the dissolution of transition metal ions. In addition, the LiF interphases derived from the trifluorotoluylation cations increase the modulus of the anode interface and suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, the Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;LiCoO2, and Li&#8208;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with the optimized electrolytes demonstrate remarkable performance improvements at high current density (10 C), a wide voltage range of 4.5&#160;V, a high mass loading of 11.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, and a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a 2.66 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of exceeding 356&#160;Wh kg&#8210;1 and excellent cyclic stability demonstrates the potential of the strategy in providing a path for the practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Glow&#8208;Worm&#8208;Inspired Fluorescent Self&#8208;Healing Actuators for Soft Robot and Reconfigurable Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a high&#8208;performance multifunctional fluorescent actuator is fabricated by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with self&#8208;healing materials. It integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function enables reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. This actuator opens new paths to soft robots and reconfigurable information encryption.








Abstract
Fluorescent actuators with light&#8208;emitting and shape&#8208;deformation properties are promising in bionics and soft robotics. However, current fluorescent actuators barely balance actuation performances with fluorescence properties, as they exhibit insufficient brightness, poor color&#8208;purity, low&#8208;stability, and few functional&#8208;integrations, limiting their applications in complex scenarios. Herein, inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a multifunctional fluorescent actuator by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with polyurethane and graphene oxide composites is reported, which integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The actuator shows a large bending curvature of 2.48&#160;cm&#8722;1. It exhibits excellent fluorescence performances, such as quantum yields as high as 58.88% and full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum as narrow as 21&#160;nm. The actuation and fluorescence properties show long&#8208;term stability during more than 1100 cycles of near&#8208;infrared irradiation and 12&#160;h of ultraviolet exposure. Moreover, the actuator is integrated with color&#8208;changing and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing functions, enabling a synergetic color/shape change and reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. Then, a smart gripper and a crawling robot with crawling/rollover motions are demonstrated. Finally, a non&#8208;contact dynamic display of reconfigurable encrypted information driven by light is fabricated to mimic light communications of glow&#8208;worms. This actuator demonstrates unprecedented multifunctionality, opening new avenues for fluorescent soft robotics.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Autocatalyzed Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Element Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple and controllable gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis method to incorporate multiple metal elements into a single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;element nanoparticle regardless of its immiscibility at room temperature. This reaction occurs among molecules and can be predicted according to frontier molecular orbital theory.








Abstract
The incorporation of multiple metal elements into a nanoparticle without phase separation holds promise for versatile applications, yet a facile synthetic strategy is lacking. Herein, a simple and facile approach is presented, i.e., gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis, in which multiple miscible or immiscible metal elements are incorporated into single&#8208;phase nanoparticles at atmospheric pressure and temperature. This study reveals the autocatalytic reduction behavior of gold and the corresponding growth process of multi&#8208;element alloy nanoparticles. The mechanism of autocatalytic synthetic reactions is revealed on the basis of molecular orbitals. Furthermore, quinary multi&#8208;element nanoparticles were prepared and applied as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes (with overpotentials of 24 and 42&#160;mV to deliver 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) to demonstrate the application of this strategy. This strategy enables the synthesis of multi&#8208;element materials with high tolerance of synthetic conditions for versatile applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Hydration&#8208;Induced Electrical and Mechanical Torsional Energy Harvesting in Heterophilically Designed CNT Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the abundance and vast energy potential of water, its efficient utilization is hindered by single&#8208;mode energy conversion. Herein, heterophilic CNT yarns that allow for simultaneous energy harvesting by means of dual&#8208;scale hydration&#8212;electrical energy harvesting through proton gradients and mechanical torsional harvesting through microchannel absorption are presented.








Abstract
Water holds vast potential for a useful energy source, yet traditional approaches capture only a fraction of it. This study introduces a heterophilically designed carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn with an asymmetric configuration. This yarn is capable of both electrical and mechanical torsional energy harvesting through dual&#8208;scale hydration. Fabricated via half&#8208;electrochemical oxidation, the yarn contains a hydrophilic region enriched with oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and a hydrophobic pristine CNT region. Molecular&#8208;scale hydration triggers proton release in the hydrophilic region. Consequently, a concentration gradient is established that generates a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 106.0&#160;mV and a short&#8208;circuit current of 20.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Simultaneously, microscale hydration induces water absorption into inter&#8208;bundle microchannels, resulting in considerable yarn volume expansion. This process leads to hydro&#8208;driven actuation with a torsional stroke of 78.8&#176;&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a maximum rotational speed of 1012 RPM. The presented simultaneous harvesting results in electrical and mechanical power densities of 3.5&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2 and 34.3&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, during a hydration cycle. By integrating molecular and microscale hydrations, the proposed heterophilic CNT yarns establish an unprecedented platform for simultaneous electrical and mechanical energy harvesting from water, representing a groundbreaking development&#160;for sustainable applications.

         <title>Zwitterionic Brush&#8208;Grafted Interfacial Bio&#8208;Lubricant Evades Complement C3&#8208;Mediated Macrophage Phagocytosis for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrophage&#8208;evading nano&#8208;lubricant is designed to enhance osteoarthritis (OA) treatment by suppressing complement C3 adsorption and subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. Through a zwitterionic PMPC brush layer, this strategy reduces inflammation, preserves joint lubrication, and prevents OA progression. This work highlights the pivotal role of complement C3 in nanoparticle clearance and offers a novel therapeutic approach for OA management.









Abstract
Administering a bio&#8208;lubricant is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, if it can both manage symptoms and halt disease progression. However, the clearance of these bio&#8208;lubricants mediated by synovial macrophages leads to reduced therapeutic efficiency and adverse inflammatory responses. Herein, it is shown that this process is predominantly mediated by the specific binding of complement C3 (on nanoparticle) and CD11b (on macrophage). More importantly, through a systematic evaluation of various interface modifications, a macrophage&#8208;evading nanoparticle strategy is proposed, which not only minimizes friction, but also largely suppresses C3 adsorption. It involves employing a zwitterionic poly&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) brush layer grafted from a crosslinked gelatin core. In vitro studies demonstrate that such a nanoparticle lubricant can evade macrophage phagocytosis and further prevent the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 polarization and subsequent harmful release of cytokines. In vivo studies show that the designed PMPC brush layer effectively mitigates synovial inflammation, alleviates OA&#8208;associated pain, and protects cartilage from degeneration, thus preventing OA progression. These findings clarify the pivotal role of complement C3&#8208;mediated macrophage recognition in nanoparticles clearance and offer a promising nanoparticle design strategy to restore joint lubrication.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Dual Lewis&#8208;Acid Filler for Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reveals that Li+ transference number (t+), concentration (C0), and diffusion coefficient (D) critically influence dendrite growth in SPEs. By developing dual&#8208;Lewis&#8208;acid fillers, these parameters are simultaneously enhanced, and constructed a stable inorganic SEI layer. The optimized electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries with NCM811/NCM622/LFP cathodes under demanding operating conditions.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are regarded as promising candidates that could address the safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes. Nonetheless, SPEs are still confronting serious lithium dendrite issues, and there is a lack of systematic studies regarding the formation of lithium dendrites within SPEs. Herein, Sand equation is employed to elucidate the determinants of dendrite growth in SPEs, revealing that three factors including the Li+ transference number, Li+ diffusion coefficient, and Li+ concentration are positively correlated with Sand's time (&#964;) which determine the plating/striping behaviors of Li anode. More importantly, an effective and universal approach is proposed to construct dendrite&#8208;free polymer lithium metal batteries with dual&#8208;Lewis&#8208;acid materials such as Zinc Borate (ZB). Endowed with ZB materials, the PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte possesses sufficient Li+ supply and swift transport channel and thus achieves an impressively high Li+ transference number of 0.9 and outstanding ionic conductivity at 30&#160;&#176;C (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), outperforming the polymer electrolytes with single Lewis&#8208;acid fillers. The electrolyte imparts the LFP//Li cell with exceptional capacity retention, showing almost no decay in discharge capacity even after 700, 500, and 300 cycles at 2 C, 3 C, and 5 C, respectively. Additionally, it capacitates the LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2//Li cell to outperform by achieving over 1900 cycles at 1C and stably cycling under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5V.

         <title>Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Decay of Room Temperature Metastable Skyrmions and a Nascent Double&#8208;q Spin Texture in Co8Zn9Mn3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable skyrmions in chiral cubic Co8Zn9Mn3 are shown to exhibit decay dynamics influenceable by varying the magnetic anisotropy at room temperature, revealing a new avenue for control of topological magnetism. This study further uncovers a nascent square&#8208;coordinated spin texture that coexists with hexagonal skyrmion lattices, highlighting a rich topological landscape. The findings may enable advanced applications based on dynamic and customizable properties of topological spin textures at room temperature.








Abstract
Chiral cubic Co&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room&#8208;temperature skyrmion phases and robust far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co8Zn9Mn3 is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double&#8208;q spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors q, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple&#8208;q hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double&#8208;q texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological&#160;applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradual Helical Structure for Enhancing the Strength and Toughness of Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving synergistic strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from multi&#8208;layer helical structures observed in natural organisms, a green, facile, and versatile transitional unit design strategy is designed to construct a gradual helical structure. This approach helps successfully achieve simultaneous strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Multilayered helical arrangements are commonly observed in natural creatures to enhance their strength and toughness. A biomimicry of such an intricate structure has thus far been challenging. Herein, a green, facile, and versatile design strategy is proposed for transitional units. The proposed strategy is applied to develop a gradual helical (GH) structure that can reinforce thermoplastics using bamboo fibers (&#8776;20&#160;cm). A transitional unit is constructed through a combination of rolling and twisting. Following hot pressing, a biomimetic fiber&#8208;reinforced composite with a GH structure is fabricated. The GH structure is made up of 3D helical fibers with a gradual variation in the helical angle from the surface to the core, achieving minimal staggered angles and bridging of different fiber layers. Owing to stress decomposition and transfer as well as the coupling effect of the helical fibers, the GH structure exhibits outstanding tensile and bending strengths. Moreover, owing to the staggered arrangement, bridging, and deformation behavior of the fibers, the GH structure achieves remarkable impact toughness through crack deflection and fiber uncoiling. The GH structure and transitional unit assembly strategy can facilitate the development of advanced composites with superior mechanical properties through an environmentally friendly, simple, and versatile structural design approach.

         <title>Two&#8208;Layer Graphite Anode for Energy and Power Densified LiFePO4 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work identifies the lithium plating failure mechanism in energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type single&#8208;layer graphite electrodes. Based on this, a two&#8208;layer graphite anode is designed and scaled up, with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top and power&#8208;type graphite on the bottom. This design inhibits lithium plating and greatly extends the lifespan of energy and power&#8208;densified LFP batteries.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are increasingly adopted in grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their superior performance and cost metrics. However, as the desired energy and power are further densified, the lifespan of LiFePO4 batteries is significantly limited, mainly because the lithium plating severely occurs on the graphite anode. Here, first the lithium plating characteristics of both energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type graphite electrodes in single&#8208;layer design are deciphered. Based on these findings, a suitable two&#8208;layer design with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top layer and power&#8208;type one on the bottom layer, is disclosed. Such configuration effectively inhibits lithium plating throughout the graphite electrode, drastically increasing the lifespan in an energy&#8208; and power&#8208;densified LiFePO4 battery.

     alt="Two-Layer Graphite Anode for Energy and Power Densified LiFePO4 Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work identifies the lithium plating failure mechanism in energy-type and power-type single-layer graphite electrodes. Based on this, a two-layer graphite anode is designed and scaled up, with energy-type graphite on the top and power-type graphite on the bottom. This design inhibits lithium plating and greatly extends the lifespan of energy and power-densified LFP batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are increasingly adopted in grid-scale energy storage due to their superior performance and cost metrics. However, as the desired energy and power are further densified, the lifespan of LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is significantly limited, mainly because the lithium plating severely occurs on the graphite anode. Here, first the lithium plating characteristics of both energy-type and power-type graphite electrodes in single-layer design are deciphered. Based on these findings, a suitable two-layer design with energy-type graphite on the top layer and power-type one on the bottom layer, is disclosed. Such configuration effectively inhibits lithium plating throughout the graphite electrode, drastically increasing the lifespan in an energy- and power-densified LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; battery. The assembled pouch cell with an energy density of 161.5&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, delivers a capacity retention rate of 90.8% after 2000 cycles at 2&#160;C. This work provides valuable insights into the failure mechanism of graphite electrodes, but also innovative strategies of electrode engineering for extending batteries&#8217; performance horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Processable and Recyclable Covalent Organic Framework Gel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of COF gels is demonstrated and presents a method for solution&#8208;based reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes, inspired by the operational principle of wedges. By introducing oxygen atoms into the framework, the interaction forces are modulated between the framework layers and introduce active sites for trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This approach enables the exfoliation of COF layers, allowing them to be effectively dispersed as a nanosheet in an aqueous&#8208;TFA solution. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of imine bond and controlling the ratio of TFA to water, this manages the competitive interactions between TFA, COF, and water molecules, enabling the reconfiguration of COF materials from nanosheet dispersions back to gels. The obtained gel material demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, and sustaining performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with abundant ordered channels and accessible interaction sites have shown great potential in energy storage and transformation, although their practical applications are strongly impeded by their inherent insolubility and non&#8208;melt processability. Developing processable COF gel electrolytes and recycling them remains a formidable challenge. In this study, the processing of COF to gels demonstrated through interlayer interaction manipulation and enable solution&#8208;reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes for the first time, inspired by the working principle of wedges. Good solution&#8208;processability of the COF powders in strong acid mediums is achieved by inserting oxygen atoms into its framework to promote the interlayer charge repulsion. This modification enabled the COF readily dispersable as colloidal nanosheets in an aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Starting from here, this is modulated competitive interactions among TFA, COF, and water molecules, to reconfigure COF materials between their gelified and colloidally dispersed states. The reconfigured COF gel maintains their mechanical properties and long cycle life as an electrolyte in the battery (&gt;800&#160;h). This approach realizes solution processing of COF powders and can recycle COF out of gels for repeated use, offering new insights and strategies for their preparation and sustainable recycling.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;skinned Alumina fiber Fabric for Diverse Electrothermal and Electromagnetic Compatibility and Its Mass Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance, electrothermal capability, as well as electromagnetic reflectivity and transmissivity. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.








Abstract
As electronics and instrumentation grow increasingly complex, multifunctional materials are essential for simplifying designs. Electrothermal and electromagnetic functions are commonly used, typically supplied by separate materials. Integrating them into a single material can reduce components and miniaturize systems. Meanwhile, materials with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties are needed to meet diverse application requirements, from electromagnetic waves transmitting to shielding, and electric heating across a wide temperature range. Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance (1&#8211;10&#160;000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), electrothermal capability (up to &#8776;1400&#160;&#176;C), as well as electromagnetic reflectivity (&#8776;0.003 to &#8776;0.91) and transmissivity (&#8776;0.98 to &#8776;0.0001) by adjusting graphene thickness and AFF pore size. Mass production of GAFFs in various specifications is realized, enabling diverse applications. Heating&#8208;shielding&#8208;integrated device (GAFF&#8208;HS) featuring high electromagnetic reflectivity and low transmissivity, and heating&#8208;transmitting&#8208;compatible device (GAFF&#8208;HT) with low electromagnetic reflectivity and high transmissivity, are both fabricated to target distinct applications: electrothermal anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing for electromagnetic interference shielding systems and radar systems, respectively. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.

         <title>Superwetting&#8208;Enabled In Situ Silicification for Artificial Silicified Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is proposed to fabricate artificial silicified wood without high pressure and high temperature. The artificial silicified wood exhibits super flexural strength (&#8776;216.49 MPa) and resistance to termites (98.70% mass retention) and fungi (over 90.64% mass retention), meeting the highest AWPA and ASTM standards. This method offers a promising approach to the conservation of wooden artifacts.








Abstract
Wooden artifacts have attracted comprehensive concern as the witnesses of human civilization; however, their conservation suffers from many difficulties, such as natural degradation and biological invasion. Silicified wood, as a fossil material that has existed for millions of years, provides a valuable clue for the long&#8208;term conservation of wooden materials. In this work, a superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is reported to silicify wood in a confined way, fabricating artificial silicified wood within 100 h. The superwetting process of the silica sol enables multi&#8208;scale high silica filling throughout the entire wood from the nanoscale to the macroscale. The artificial silicified wood shows a high flexural strength of &#8776;216.49&#160;MPa and super resistance against termites and fungi. The artificial silicified wood retains 98.70% of its mass against termites, and over 90.64% of its mass against fungi, meeting the safest level in the global standards. The finding provides a general silicification approach for wood&#8208;like materials with complex hierarchical structures and a promisingly alternative solution for the conservation of wooden artifacts.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active Single&#8208;Atom Modified S&#8208;MXene as Cathode Catalysts for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li&#8322;S oxidation process on single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified S&#8208;functionalized MXenes (SA&#8208;S&#8208;MXenes) monolayers are investigated. Five SA adsorption sites are considered: fcc (I), hcp (II), top (III), M substitution by SA (IV), and S substitution by SA (V). Among these, Ni, Cu, and Zn at the IV site exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance, characterized by the lowest Gibbs free energy for the SRR process and the decomposition barrier for Li&#8322;S.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. To address these challenges, this work proposes an efficient strategy by introducing single atoms (SAs) into sulfur&#8208;functionalized MXenes (S&#8208;MXenes) catalysts and evaluate their potential in Li&#8208;S batteries through first&#8208;principles calculations. Using high&#8208;throughput screening of various SA&#8208;modified S&#8208;MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S&#8208;MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene&#8208;based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA&#8208;induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d&#8208;band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates. To elucidate the intrinsic adsorption properties of intermediates, this work develops a machine learning model with high accuracy (R2 = 0.88), which underscores the pivotal roles of SA electronegativity and local coordination environment in determining adsorption strength, offering valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts.

Using high-throughput screening of various SA-modified S-MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S-MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene-based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA-induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d-band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates. To elucidate the intrinsic adsorption properties of intermediates, this work develops a machine learning model with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.88), which underscores the pivotal roles of SA electronegativity and local coordination environment in determining adsorption strength, offering valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biophysical&#8208;Inspired Interpenetrated Fibrillar and Reticular Collagen Scaffold with Vascular Endothelial Cell Membrane Incorporation for Guided In Situ Spleen Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spleen's complex structure limits its regenerative capacity after injury, significantly impacting patient quality of life. This work develops an inducible scaffold mimicking spleen parenchyma, enhancing in situ regeneration. This scaffold reduces oxidative stress, recruits cells, and promotes tissue integration, while proteomics reveal activation of key metabolic pathways, enhancing splenic function and blood vessel regeneration.








Abstract
The spleen's complex structure and limited regenerative ability hinder its regrowth at the site of injure, affecting patient quality of life and risk severe complications. The spleen's stroma primarily consists of reticular and fibrillar collagen, supporting its microvascular network. Inspired by such biophysical environment, this work develops an inducible scaffold featuring an interpenetrating network structure of fibrous and reticular collagen, which is loaded with vascular endothelial cell membranes to facilitate in situ regeneration. The regenerated parenchyma includes red pulp, white pulp, and a vascular system. The scaffold effectively reduces oxidative stress at the injury site, recruits cells to degrade the scaffold, and promotes tissue integration, thereby accelerating spleen regeneration. Additionally, the regenerated tissue compensates for the spleen's functions, enhancing its ability to clear abnormal red blood cells and platelets. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses reveal that the scaffold induced the upregulation of key pathways, including the Wnt signalling pathway, Statin pathway, and amino acid metabolism pathway. This activation mobilizes splenic cells metabolism, enhances immune cell activity, and facilitates the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, the incorporated cell membrane components promote splenic blood vessels regeneration by upregulating the neural crest cell differentiation pathway within the tissue.

         <title>A Microphase Separation&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Tissue Adhesive with Instantaneous Dry/Wet Adhesion, Alcohol&#8208;Triggered Debonding, and Antibacterial Hemostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separation&#8208;driven supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane exhibits instantaneous adhesion in both dry and wet environments. In the meantime, this material demonstrates the capacity for antibacterial hemostasis upon application to biological tissues and can be readily removed from tissue surfaces through wet wiping with medical&#8208;grade alcohol.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising materials for expeditious hemorrhage control, while it remains a grand challenge to engineer a superior formulation with instantaneous adhesion, on&#8208;demand debonding, and the integration of multiple desirable properties such as antibacterial and hemostatic capabilities. Herein, a multifunctional supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is introduced, driven by a reversible microphase separation mechanism. By optimizing the content of guanidinium ions, precise control over cohesive strength, adhesion, and wettability is achieved, resulting in strong instantaneous adhesion under both dry and wet conditions. Notably, the supramolecular nature of the adhesive allows for convenient on&#8208;demand removal using medical&#8208;grade alcohol, offering a critical advantage for easy debonding. Additionally, the adhesive exhibits remarkable antimicrobial properties while maintaining excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Its underwater injectability supports minimally invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, the adhesive's ability to incorporate solid particles enhances its versatility, particularly for the development of drug&#8208;embedded bioadhesives. This work addresses key challenges in tissue adhesive design via a microphase separation&#8208;driven working principle, thereby opening promising new avenues for the development of advanced bioadhesives with tailored properties and enhanced surgical and wound care outcomes.

         <title>Lowering Toxicity of Solvent in Organic Solar Cells Manufacturing for 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acute toxicological properties of the solvents commonly used in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) are evaluated. The preparation technology of devices and micro&#8208;modules by developing solvent processing methods are committed to optimizing with low ecological impact. Finally, an optimized solvent formulation of TCE:OXY blend is arrived to yield a module efficiency of 17.6% with area of 18.4 cm2.








Abstract
Thin film organic photovoltaics (OPVs) aim to harness solar energy environmentally friendly, highly efficient, and cost&#8208;effective means, thereby offering a sustainable solution for energy production and ecological preservation. Efforts are undertook to optimize engineering preparation technology for OPV devices and mini&#8208;modules, through the development of low&#8208;ecological&#8208;impact solvent processing method. A newly developed solvent engineering strategy employing environmentally benign o&#8208;xylene (OXY) with synergistic dual additives (DIM and DIB) achieved an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% (JSC of 26.6 mA cm&#8722;2, VOC of 0.935 V, FF of 80.3%) alongside exceptional stability metrics (82%&#8211;1500h). The mini&#8208;module processed with optimized TCE:OXY (1:3 v/v) solvent demonstrated scalable performance reaching 17.6% (18.4 cm2), representing the highest performance achieved in the development safe solvent based OPVs. Suitable microscale patterns contributed to a broader range of receiving angles, enabling more flexible installation geometries for building&#8208;integrated applications.

         <title>Photoinduced, Swift, and Reversible Spatiotemporal Programming of Double Dynamically Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating anthracene&#8208;based dynamic bonds into a supramolecular liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) enables swift and reversible alternation of its local nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperature and global actuation strain. The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (TNI) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An&#8208;A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the TNI of the LCE, into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An&#8208;A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the TNI, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom&#8208;designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.

         <title>Efficient Kinetic Separation of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene Using Mordenites Featuring Modified 1D Channels with Excellent Selectivity and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes while maintaining high gas diffusivity through the modification of the 1D channels of micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. The weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) exhibits remarkable carbon dioxide/acetylene kinetic selectivity (534.3), and high carbon dioxide capacity and diffusion constant.








Abstract
The design of physical adsorbents for a precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes is of importance as adsorptive separation can serve as an alternative to energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes. However, it is challenging to balance the selectivity, capacity, and adsorption kinetics of the adsorbents. Herein, an efficient kinetic separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide is reported, which have nearly identical kinetic sizes, achieved through modification of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels of a micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. Under ambient conditions, the weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite denoted as NaAlO2@MOR(0.5), exhibits a remarkable kinetic separation selectivity of 534.3 while retaining an excellent diffusivity for CO2. Compared to other adsorbent materials, its dynamic column performance for carbon dioxide significantly exceeds those of molecular sieve materials. In terms of separation selectivity, it is superior to thermodynamic separation adsorbents. The high efficiency of NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) in CO2/C2H2 kinetic separation is validated by column breakthrough experiments. Furthermore, NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) has a low cost and high thermal stability. This study can guide the design of adsorbents that balance selectivity, capacity, and gas diffusivity, to provide a highly efficient kinetic separation of gas molecules with similar kinetic diameters.

         <title>Parallel Regulation of Charge Dynamics on Bipolar Ferroelectric Surfaces Breaks the Limits for Water Splitting Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by synergistically modulating carrier dynamics, both the separation efficiency and the quantity of electrons and holes transferred to ferroelectrics are optimized in parallel. As a result, the highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5.78% at 365 nm for overall water splitting among ferroelectric materials is achieved and reported to date.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, known for their non&#8208;inversion symmetry, show promise as photocatalysts due to their unique asymmetric charge separation, which separates hydrogen and oxygen evolution sites. However, the strong depolarized field induces a relaxed surface structure, which in turn directly leads to slow hole charge transfer dynamics, hindering their efficiency in water splitting. In this study, a fundamental breakthrough in dramatically enhancing the overall water&#8208;splitting activity is presented, through the synergistically regulating of the surface behaviors of photogenerated carriers,&#160;resulting in nearly perfect parallel dynamics and balanced amounts. By depositing atomic layers of TiO2 onto the surface of PbTiO3, surface vacancies are effectively passivated, significantly prolonging the hole lifetime from 10&#8722;6 to 10&#8722;3 s. Spatially resolved transient photovoltage spectroscopy showed that improved hole dynamics led to a 180&#176; phase shift between photogenerated electrons and holes, indicating nearly identical extraction dynamics. Notably, hole and electron concentrations increased to equivalent levels. This leads to a nearly 578&#8208;fold increment in the apparent quantum yield, resulting in significantly increased overall water&#8208;splitting rates, with a quantum yield of 5.78% at 365&#160;nm. The strategy is also effective with Al2O3 and SiO2, demonstrating its versatility across varied materials, providing&#160;a valuable method for creating high&#8208;performance ferroelectric photocatalysts.

         <title>Active Hydrogen Enrichment on Cu6Sn5&#8208;type High Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 high entropy intermetallic compound achieves excellent performance for ammonia electrosynthesis, allowing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction in a wide concentration range, excellent stability, and direct production of ammonium product. The high intrinsic catalytic activity is attributed to improved H* generation, inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction, and low reaction free energy of the hydrogenation process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides a feasible strategy for green ammonia production and the treatment of nitrate pollution in wastewater. The generation of active hydrogen (H*) plays an important role in improving the selectivity, yield rate, and Faradaic efficiency of ammonia products. Here, structurally ordered nanoporous Cu6Sn5&#8208;type high entropy intermetallics (HEI) with extremely superior performance toward NO3RR is demonstrated. The optimal nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 HEI delivers a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.09 &#177; 1.15% and excellent stability of 120 h at the industrial level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2, accordingly directly converting NO3&#8210; to high&#8208;purity (NH4)2HPO4 with near&#8208;unity efficiency. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental results reveal that the ordered multi&#8208;site nature of the nanoporous HEI can simultaneously promote water dissociation, reduce the reaction&#8208;free energy of the hydrogenation process, and suppress hydrogen evolution. This work provides the design of the precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free HEI for sustainable NH3 synthesis and paves insights into the H* enrichment mechanism.

         <title>A Durable and Highly Active Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Cells: New Insight into Segregation Suppression of Layered Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted significant attention in the field of Solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their outstanding advantages. However, there is a lack of studies on mechanism through which entropy increases in HEO oxygen electrodes affects segregation suppression. Based on PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF), a novel (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode is designed and fabricated in this work to claim the mechanism of entropy&#8208;enhanced in layered perovskite.








Abstract
One challenge to realize the commercialization of solid oxide cell technology is the instability and poor catalytic activity of the oxygen electrode during stack operation caused by Cr&#8208;containing alloy interconnect. Particularly well&#8208;known Sr/Ba&#8208;containing perovskite oxides can easily segregate Sr/Ba to the surface, reacting with vaporized Cr and causing Cr poisoning. To address this challenge, this work designs an entropy&#8208;driven layered structural strategy to suppress the surface segregation of cations and realize substantial enhancement of catalysis activity and Cr tolerance. The investigations suggest that the planar strain generated by entropy increase in the rare earth layer plays a pivotal role in suppressing alkaline earth segregation. Consequently, the half&#8208;cells with (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode exhibit significantly improved stability in various operation conditions with Cr containment. Furthermore, LPNSBSCF shows the high power density of 2.12 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.41 W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C in the single cells of oxygen ion and proton type, respectively. This paper provides new insights into segregation suppression in layered perovskite and offers theoretical guidance for the rational design of oxygen electrodes to achieve high Cr&#8208;tolerance and catalytic activity.

         <title>In Situ Formation of a Bi/Mg&#8208;Based Hybrid Interphase for Highly Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer is formed on the Mg foil via an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8722;solid redox reaction. Magnesiophilic components enhance Mg ion transfer, desolvation, and nucleation kinetics, whereas magnesiophobic species confer passivation&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;resistant properties. Consequently, the smooth anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase facilitates homogeneous charge/ion distribution, promoting a highly reversible Mg plating/stripping process.








Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is a promising anode material for magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) owing to its high specific capacity, excellent safety profile, and abundant availability. However, pristine Mg anodes suffer from uneven plating/stripping and surface passivation/corrosion, limiting the safety and cycling stability of MMBs. This study introduces a Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer on Mg foil (denoted Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg) through an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid redox reaction by immersing the foil in a bismuth oxybromide suspension. The resulting interphase layer consists of magnesiophilic components (Bi metal and Bi2Mg3 alloy) and magnesiophobic species (MgO, MgBr2, and BiBr3). These components synergistically enhance the desolvation, nucleation, and deposition kinetics, mitigate side reactions, and promote uniform electric field and ion flux distributions. As a result, the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg electrodes exhibit superior Mg plating/stripping reversibility, maintaining stable performance for over 4100&#160;h in the all&#8208;phenyl complex electrolyte and 2900&#160;h in the Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte, significantly outperforming pristine Mg electrodes. Furthermore, full cells paired with Mo6S8 and S cathodes demonstrate excellent capacities, rate capabilities, and long lifespans, highlighting the exceptional electrochemical performance of the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg anode. This study offers a promising strategy for developing highly reversible Mg anodes, paving the way for practical long&#8208;cycle MMBs.

         <title>Bioinspired O2&#8208;Evolution Catalysts with Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Pathway for Portable Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>

Bioinspired Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide (Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x) is developed as an O2&#8208;evolution catalyst with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for efficient and low&#8208;energy O2 generation. The lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x optimizes Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thereby enhancing O2 production performance. This technique ensures an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability, providing significant societal benefits.









Abstract
Producing high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) has a wide range of applications across diverse sectors, such as medicine, tunnel construction, the chemical industry, and fermentation. However, current O2 production methods are burdened by complexity, heavy equipment, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability to harsh environments. Here, to address this grand challenge, the de novo design of Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide is proposed to serve as bioinspired O2&#8208;evolution catalysts with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and portable O2 generation. The comprehensive studies confirm that the lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;based O2&#8208;evolution catalyst can trigger a PCET pathway to optimize Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thus ultimately reducing reaction energy barriers and improving the activities and durabilities. Consequently, the prepared Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;loaded membrane catalysts exhibit rapid and long&#8208;term stable O2 production capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed material design strategy of lattice H&#8208;species shows remarkable universality and adaptability to broad Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxides. This efficient, portable, and cost&#8208;effective O2 generation technique is suggested to ensure an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability or air pollution, thus offering significant societal benefits in broad applications.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of a Single Chain Polymorph of a 2D Solid within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb2Te3, with a blue&#8208;shifted band gap in the short&#8208;wave infrared regime.








Abstract
The discovery and synthesis of atomically precise low&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials have led to numerous unusual structural motifs and nascent physical properties. However, access to low&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW)&#8208;bound analogs of bulk crystals is often limited by chemical considerations arising from structural factors like atomic radii, bonding or coordination, and electronegativity. Using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as confinement templates, we demonstrate the synthesis of a short&#8208;wave infrared&#8208;absorbing quasi&#8208;1D (q&#8208;1D) chain polymorph of Sb2Te3 ([Sb4Te6]n) that is structurally and electronically distinct from its 2D counterpart. It is found that the q&#8208;1D chain polymorph has both three&#8208; and five&#8208;coordinate Sb atoms covalently bonded to Te and is thermodynamically stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the encapsulated chain and the model SWCNT. The complementary experimental and computational results demonstrate the synthetic advantage of vdW nanotube confinement in the discovery of low&#8208;dimensional polytypes with drastically altered physical properties and potential applications in energy conversion processes.

         <title>Mechanophysical Synthesis of Core/Shell Hybrid Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collision&#8208;driven mechanophysical synthesis enables rapid, chemical&#8208;free assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) by embedding inorganic nanomaterials onto polymer microparticles. Governed by collision and interfacial energies, this scalable, solvent&#8208;free method accommodates diverse material combinations, allowing multifunctional HSPs for pollutant removal with easy recovery and reuse&#8211;offering a sustainable alternative to conventional surface modification techniques, which often require excessive chemicals and multi&#8208;step processes.








Abstract
Surface modification of polymer microparticles (MPs) is often essential to impart functionalities beyond their inherent properties. However, decorating these surfaces typically requires complex, multi&#8208;step wet chemistry processes to direct assembly and bonding between surfaces, which are not only challenging to control and scale up but also pose significant environmental concerns. Inspired by asteroid impact events, assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) is demonstrated via collision&#8208;driven, one&#8208;step dry mixing of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;and polymer MPs with a significant contrast in elastic moduli&#8212; a process termed &#8220;mechanophysical synthesis.&#8221; Through the interplay of interfacial energy and collision energy, NPs are stably embedded onto the MP surface. The degree of surface coverage depends on mixing velocity and duration, aligning with results from particle collision simulations. HSPs can be created from a diverse combination of MPs and NPs, regardless of their shapes or chemistry. Furthermore, different types of functional NPs&#8212;such as magnetic, photocatalytic, and ion&#8208;adsorptive&#8212;can be simultaneously introduced onto the MPs. The resulting HSPs can not only remove toxic water pollutants, but also be easily recovered and reused. The mechanophysical synthesis approach opens a new direction for sustainable and versatile self&#8208;assembly of heterogeneous MPs, minimizing the use of excessive chemicals and solvents.

         <title>Decoding Directional Control in Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching via Catalyst Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) enables silicon nanostructure fabrication but suffers from isotropic undercutting. This study highlights the critical role of catalyst morphology in etching directionality. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts induce lateral etching, while thermal treatment at 450&#160;&#176;C stabilizes catalyst geometry, promoting vertical etching. These findings offer a strategy for precise silicon nanostructure control, advancing semiconductor and nanofabrication applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating silicon nanostructures, yet the presence of anomalous isotropic etching poses significant challenges for precise dimensional control. Here, it is demonstrated that catalyst morphology, particularly its aspect ratio, plays a crucial role in determining etching directionality. Through systematic investigation of the initial stages of MaCE, it is revealed that significant undercutting occurs within seconds of etching initiation, persisting across all solution compositions. This phenomenon is quantitatively analyzed using the Degree of Undercutting (DoU) and Degree of Anisotropy (DoA) metrics, establishing that conventional solution chemistry control alone cannot suppress lateral etching. These findings reveal that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio dendrite catalysts, formed at elevated AgNO3 concentrations, undergo physical separation during etching, leading to residual catalysts that promote localized isotropic etching. To address this, a thermal treatment approach is developed that effectively transforms these problematic structures into stable, low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts. A critical transition at 450&#160;&#176;C, where enhanced silver atom mobility coincides with surface defect formation, enables nearly perfect vertical etching. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the relationship between catalyst geometry and etching behavior but also presents a practical solution for achieving precise control over silicon nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Enabling Targeted Zinc Growth via Interface Regulation Toward Binder Free and High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D self&#8208;assembled SiO2@SiO2/C nanorods crosslinked nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (SSA/NCF) networks are prepared by electrostatic spinning to promote the preferential deposition of (101) crystalline surfaces to obtain dense and flat zinc anodes. Uniform zinc ion transport and enhanced ion transfer kinetics are also achieved toward flexible, binder&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance APLs.








Abstract
Owing to the low redox potential, abundant nature, and widespread availability, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted extensive investigation. Nevertheless, the commercialization of the batteries is severely hindered by negative side reactions, catastrophic dendrite growth, and uneven Zn2+ diffusion. Here, 3D self&#8208;assembled necklace&#8208;like nanofibers are developed by a simple electrospinning technique, in which SiO2@SiO2/C nanospheres are sequentially aligned on interconnected nitrogen/carbon networks (SSA/NCF) to achieve binder&#8208;free, high&#8208;performance, and dendrite&#8208;free growth of APLs. The design structure combines excellent interfacial ion transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation. The protective layer of SSA/NCF paper exhibits a high affinity for Zn2+, thereby reducing the nucleation barrier of Zn2+ and ensuring a more homogeneous Zn deposit. More importantly, this multifunctional interfacial layer induces preferential crystalline (101) oriented electroplating growth and promotes oriented dense Zn deposition. Consequently, the SSA/NCF paper layer endowed the cell with remarkable cycling stability, achieving an extended cycle life of 3000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study offers novel insights into the development of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Grain Boundary Phase toward Superior Thermoelectric Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of grain boundary phases with low resistivity can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an in situ engineering approach inducing TiO2&#8208;n to reduce interfacial barriers, which is attributed to the formation of Ti3Sb. These secondary phases significantly enhance the power factor while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity, thereby resulting in a superior figure of merit (zT) and conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As a promising thermoelectric material for electronic cooling and power generation, Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 has received extensive attention. Despite efforts to enhance its performance through composite modulation, challenges such as secondary phase refinement, dispersion, and interfacial mismatch, particularly at grain boundaries, remain critical. In this work, by incorporating TiO2&#8208;n into the Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;based matrix, the grain boundary phases are in situ engineered, yielding a superior figure of merit (zT) exceeding 2 at 798 K. The electrical conductivity is significantly enhanced with only slight changes to the Seebeck coefficient over the entire temperature range, mainly due to the contribution to carrier concentration and mobility from the newly generated Ti3Sb at grain boundaries. Benefiting from the remarkably enhanced power factor and the diminished lattice thermal conductivity, the zT value shows an overall increase within the temperature range of 300&#8211;798 K, leading to a considerable conversion efficiency of 15% for the single&#8208;leg device.

A torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy utilizing cyano&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) achieves intramolecular decoupling and intermolecular polarization, optimizing exciton dissociation and charge transport. The single&#8208;component phototransistor based on 2CNTT exhibits ultralow energy consumption, high photoresponse, and synaptic functionalities, providing an efficient design strategy for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Organic optoelectronic devices are advancing toward miniaturization and integration, demanding high performance, low energy consumption, and simplified manufacturing. The development of single&#8208;component phototransistors is still in its early stages, particularly for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Here, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) is developed and a cyano&#8208;mediated torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy is proposed to construct conjugated polymers via direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. This structural modification promotes intramolecular decoupling and enhances intermolecular interactions, enabling intra&#8208;/interchain charge distribution to be regulated. N&#8208;type copolymers based on 2CNTT exhibited broad visible&#8208;light absorption range and small exciton binding energy, capable of stable exciton generation and stepwise dissociation. The PFIID2NTT&#8208;based single&#8208;component phototransistor showed stable unipolar electron mobility and strong photoresponse with light&#8208;current/dark&#8208;current ratio as high as 9.02 &#215; 104, and a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index over 236% under visible light. The devices also operate at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption (13.23 aJ), mimicking neural synapse behavior and enabling long&#8208;term memory functionality. The strategy optimizes charge distribution and exciton utilization in n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, presenting a new paradigm for developing multifunctional organic optoelectronics.

A further developed fluorescence temperature endoscopy system overcomes the light penetration limitation, realizing real&#8208;time temperature guidance during liver tumor ablation in rabbit model.








Abstract
Thermal ablation is a common treatment option for early&#8208;stage cancers, but the lack of real&#8208;time temperature imaging feedback method increases the risk of incomplete or excessive ablation. Although ratiometric nanothermometer offers a rapid temperature imaging solution, accurate in vivo signal extraction remains challenging due to the autofluorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering. Herein, a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer composed of europium and iridium complex with identical working wavelength but distinguishing lifetimes is reported, whose well&#8208;designed structures enable 450&#160;nm excitation of both complexes with a high quantum yield (57.8%). Based on the nanothermometer, accurate signal extraction is realized in whole blood, beneath a 2 cm tissue phantom and a 5 mm pork slice through a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric method. By leveraging the exceptional thermal sensitivity (6.9% K&#8722;1), high temperature resolution (0.02 K), and clinically relevant temperature range (30&#8211;96&#160;&#176;C) of the nanothermometer, a fluorescence temperature endoscopy system is further designed with a real&#8208;time temperature imaging speed of 10 fps, which is applied to minimally invasive temperature monitoring during microwave ablation of liver tumors in rabbits, realizing precise ablation control through dynamic ablation power adjustment. The real&#8208;time and accurate temperature imaging performance of the nanothermometer may offer a new perspective for intraoperative guidance.

         <title>Robust Imaging through Light&#8208;Scattering Barriers via Energetically Modulated Multispectral Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines universal strategies for electron&#8208;blocking layers in high&#8208;performance organic photodetectors by introducing a newly designed self&#8208;assembled monolayer. These strategies enable robust imaging of objects across thick light&#8208;scattering barriers under near&#8208;infrared illumination, a previously only theorized challenge in photodetection.








Abstract
Emerging technologies, such as biomedical imaging and autonomous driving, rely on low&#8208;noise near infrared (NIR) photodetectors. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) offer tremendous potential for these applications because of their seamless integration and NIR photosensing capabilities; however, their high noise levels have constrained widespread commercialization. Herein, the study demonstrates a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) NIR OPD featuring an ultralow noise current of 2.18 fA, enabled by a newly synthesized electron&#8208;blocking layer (EBL), ((2,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8208;diyl)bis(propane&#8208;3,1&#8208;diyl))bis(phosphonic acid) (3PAFCN). Through diverse energetic modulative design strategies, 3PAFCN enables the OPD to achieve homogenous surface properties, an elevated interfacial energy barrier, and optimized BHJ morphology, culminating in a notable specific detectivity of 2.50 &#215; 1014&#160;cm Hz0.5&#160;W&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm illumination under white&#8208;noise conditions. These EBL design principles are broadly applicable for various photoactive materials. Demonstrations in single&#8208;pixel imaging highlight the exceptional clarity of the 3PAFCN&#8208;based OPD in low&#8208;light and foggy environments, underscoring the potential of OPD technology for advanced imaging applications.

         <title>Nanofibrous Guidance Conduits with Multiple Gradient Cues for Spinal Cord Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel guidance conduits are fabricated through electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, integrating topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues to promote cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation, and axonal extension. In rat models, these conduits inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, and promoted neuronal regeneration, significantly improving functional recovery and offering a promising strategy for spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that leads to severe disabilities and imposes significant economic and social burdens. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on symptom management, with limited success in promoting full neurological recovery. In response to this challenge, the design of novel guidance conduits incorporating multiple gradient cues, inspired is reported by biological processes, to enhance spinal cord repair. These conduits are fabricated using electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, a simple yet effective method that integrates topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues into a single scaffold. The synergy of these cues significantly promoted cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, and axonal extension, resulting in substantial improvements in spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model. Single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing further demonstrated that the guidance conduit inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, restored cellular proportions, and facilitated the regeneration of neuronal axons, dendrites, and synapses. This work presents an innovative, versatile platform for fabricating tissue scaffolds that integrate multiple gradient cues, offering a promising strategy for SCI treatment and broader tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Crosslinked Hetero&#8208;Chain Polymeric Interphase Enables the Stable Cycling of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of &#8220;crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI&#8221; (CHP&#8208;CEI) is particularly tailored for LRMO cathode. This CHP&#8208;CEI is homogeneous and shows a balanced combination of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation ability, which can not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release, and transition metal dissolution are largely mitigated during cycling at aggressive voltages.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxide (LRMO) cathode shows grar promise for high&#8208;energy density and environment&#8208;friendly batteries due to its cation and anion redox. However, it suffers from continuous electrolyte consumption and capacity decay, especially at high mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm&#8722;2). Conventional electrolyte/interphase strategies fail to address the structural characteristics of LRMO, limiting its practical application. Here, we reveal the specific requirements for cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) of LRMO and accordingly design a non&#8208;fluorinated additive, 2,4,6&#8208;trivinyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylcyclotrisiloxane (TVTMS). TVTMS could form a crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI (CHP&#8208;CEI) through ring&#8208;opening polymerization and ethylene group crosslinking, offering a unique balance of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation, which could not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release and transition metal dissolution were effectively mitigated. It should be noted that, for the first time to our knowledge, we employed the single&#8208;particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) to study CEI components, especially the organic/polymer species. The Li|LRMO cells based on CHP&#8208;CEI display a lifespan &gt;825 cycles with remained capacity of 204 mAh g&#8722;1 and the cells with high&#8208;loading cathode (12 mg cm&#8722;2) achieve stable cycling &gt;145 cycles with 80% capacity retention, which surpasses the performance of previously reported electrolytes.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse&#8208;Inspired Bionic Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical&#8208;sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO&#8208;targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well&#8208;known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration.

     alt="Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse-Inspired Bionic Niche"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next-generation ECO-driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical-sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO-targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well-known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration. Taken together, this study introduces prospective concepts for designing next-generation ECO-driven biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substitution Index&#8208;Prediction Rules for Low&#8208;Potential Plateau of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution index of precursor (&#916;) is established as an effective predictor for the low&#8208;potential plateau performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Three carbon models&#8212;disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon&#8212;are constructed to validate the accuracy of &#916; and investigate the mechanisms of closed pore formation and sodium storage.








Abstract
Establishing prediction rules for the low&#8208;potential plateau (LPP) of hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). While current studies suggest that the closed pores of HC can enhance the LPP performance, the rules for directly predicting the LPP from precursors have yet to be established. Here, prediction rules for the LPP of HC anodes in SIBs&#8212;the substitution index (&#916;) of precursor are introduced. Three carbon models (disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon) are constructed to verify the accuracy of &#916; and to explore the closed&#8208;pore formation and LPP mechanism. In detail, as the &#916; increases from 0.06 to 0.22, the LPP capacity rises from 25 to 278&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, revealing a strong linear correlation between &#916; of precursor and LPP capacity. In situ XRD, Raman, and ex situ SAXS, EPR further confirm that sodium storage in HC can be categorized into adsorption (&gt;0.4&#160;V), interlayer storage (0.4 to 0.15&#160;V), and pore&#8208;filling (below 0.15&#160;V). This work not only elucidates the sodium storage mechanisms, but also provides one efficient design guideline for advanced carbon anodes in SIBs.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Controlled Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>

The study explores how interfacial redox mediation influences Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion, focusing on local environmental regulation. It is found that the VO2&#8314;/VO&#8322;&#8314; redox couple stabilizes pH, controls H&#8322;O activity, and mediates Mn3&#8314;, enabling 100% Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion. This approach suppresses Mn degradation, extends electrode lifespan, and achieves record&#8208;high electrode capacity (100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), offering a breakthrough for static Mn2+/MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) deposition/dissolution (Mn2+/MnO2) chemistry, involving a two&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, holds promise for safe and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, challenges like electrode/electrolyte interface environment fluctuations (H+ and H2O activity), irreversible Mn degradation, and limited understanding of degradation mechanisms hinder the reversibility of the Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. This study demonstrates a vanadyl/pervanadyl (VO2+/VO2+) redox&#8208;mediated interface designed for high&#8208;energy Mn2+/MnO2 batteries. Unlike flow systems, this work uncovers, for the first time, the mechanism of a static redox&#8208;mediated interface in regulating interfacial H+ and H2O activities. Significantly, the VO2+/VO2+ chemical redox mediation targets Mn3+ intermediates, suppressing their hydrolysis and enabling 100% Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. The redox&#8208;mediated interface enhances the Mn redox electron transfer process, achieving a stable &#8776;95% coulombic efficiency and ultrahigh capacity of 100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal energy density of 111&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming flow systems. The electrode also exhibits an average specific capacity of 593&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit of 616&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a specific energy density of 721&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at high MnO2 loadings (50&#8211;150&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The findings highlight the critical role of interfacial redox mediation in regulating H+ and H2O activities and underscore the significance of interface dynamics.

         <title>Weak Dipole Effect Customized Zinc Ion&#8208;Rich Protective Layer for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic protective layer is engineered on Zn surface by weak dipole effect of TMAO. The weak dipole effect realizes Zn ion&#8208;rich environment to alleviate the concentration polarization on electrolyte/Zn interface and exhibits short range interaction with free water to inhibit side reactions, thereby achieving enhanced performance for both symmetrical and full batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.








Abstract
The industrial development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries requires high performance even with lean&#8208;electrolyte. Nevertheless, lean&#8208;electrolyte can exacerbate concentration polarization at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, leading to significant Zn corrosion and battery failure. Here, a stable Zn ion&#8208;rich protective layer (TMAO&#8208;Zn) is constructed by a unique zwitterion structure of trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO). The TMAO is characterized by the direct connection between positive and negative charges (N+&#8208;O&#8722;) with minimal dipole moment, which renders weak dipole interactions to form the TMAO&#8208;Zn layer with Zn2+, thereby reducing concentration polarization and promoting the rapid and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Furthermore, the O of TMAO&#8208;Zn exhibits the higher electrophilic index, indicating a stronger propensity for stable hydrogen bond interactions with active free water in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL), thereby mitigating corrosion under extreme conditions of low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C ratio). Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with TMAO&#8208;Zn enables stable cycling for over 250&#160;h with lean&#8208;electrolyte of 15&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1. Additionally, Zn/I&#8322; pouch battery with a low E/C ratio of 21.2&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1 provides ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 96&#160;mA&#160;h for over 250 cycles (capacity retention rate of 98.3%). This study offers a new concept to propel the practical application of Zn batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.

         <title>Quantifying Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Induced Enhancement on Metal@Cu2O Composites for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal@Cu2O composites are developed as platforms to investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced enhancement on photoelectrocatalysis. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon&#8208;induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent are quantified using different bands of incident light, providing a quantitative understanding of the role of PIRET and HET in boosting photoelectrocatalysis.








Abstract
The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles can substantially enhance the activity of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactions. However, quantifying the respective contributions of different LSPR mechanisms to the enhancement of PEC performance remains an urgent challenge. In this work, Cu@Cu2O composites prepared by annealing Cu2O under an inert atmosphere and electrodeposited metal@Cu2O composites (MED@Cu2O, MED = CuED, AuED, AgED, PdED, PtED) are employed as platform materials to investigate the LSPR effect on the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). All the composites exhibited remarkably LSPR&#8208;enhanced activity toward PEC HER. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent on Cu@Cu2O and CuED@Cu2O are quantified by using different bands of incident light. Moreover, using MED@Cu2O composites, the effects of both the metal species and the applied potential on HET are quantitatively investigated. The results reveal that a pronounced HET enhancement occurs only when the LSPR peak energy is lower than the semiconductor bandgap energy (Eg) and that HET strengthens as the applied potential becomes more negative for PEC HER. This work therefore provides a quantitative understanding of the roles of PIRET and HET in boosting PEC activity.

         <title>Gradient Doping for Stress&#8208;Relief in Vapor&#8208;deposited Perovskite Film to Achieve High&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells with a 23% Efficiency</title>

A gradient doping strategy based on vapor deposition is proposed, which effectively reduces the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, promotes uniform crystallization, and applies pre&#8208;compressive stress to the surface of the perovskite film, thereby effectively alleviating the residual stress and achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;deposited p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present key advantages such as low cost, excellent stability, low&#8208;temperature fabrication, and compatibility with tandem architectures, positioning them as strong contenders for industrial&#8208;scale solar applications. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains lower than that of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Herein, a gradient doping strategy to alleviate the stress in vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite films is introduced. Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor&#8208;deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large&#8208;area and perovskite&#8208;textured silicon tandem solar cells.

         <title>Highly Coupled Dynamically Modulated Electrocatalysts on Wafer&#8208;Scale InGaN/GaN Nanowires on Silicon for Successive Acidic Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water oxidation kinetics on photoanodes under strongly acidic conditions not only limit the photocurrent but also induce severe photocorrosion. Here, loading a CoRuOX cocatalyst&#8212;exhibiting a unique dynamic electron modulation effect&#8212;onto wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires achieves a dual breakthrough in both oxidation activity and stability for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation under strongly acidic conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway for sustained PEC water oxidation in acidic environments.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is considered one of the most promising paths for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the water oxidation reaction and poor stability of the photoanode significantly limit the overall performance of the photoelectrochemical device, particularly under acidic conditions, which poses great challenges for practical applications. Herein, the coupling of unique CoRuOx nanoclusters with dynamic electronic modulation effects to wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires is proposed, demonstrating superior photoelectrochemical activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. Compared with InGaN nanowires loaded with typical RuO&#8322; cocatalysts, CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes achieve a remarkable improvement in applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency from 0.77% to 2.25%, with stable operation for over 500&#160;min under strongly acidic conditions. Such boosted performance is attributed mainly to Co induced dynamic electronic modulation, which enhances oxygen evolution while maintaining the stable operation of CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes. Initially, the Co sites increased the oxidation state of Ru, enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution. Moreover, during PEC operation, the Co sites stabilized the Ru sites, preventing dissolution of cocatalyst. This unique self&#8208;adaptive process significantly enhances the stability and activity of the photoanode, opening an effective avenue to achieve efficient and durable photoanodes for PEC applications.

         <title>Dual Doping of N and F on Co3O4 to Activate the Lattice Oxygen for Efficient and Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel plasma strategy is reported to introduce N and F in Co3O4 (N, F&#8208;Co3O4) simultaneously as the heteroatoms, which enables the OER to occur via the lattice oxygen mechanism. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 sample exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential and superior stability.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal process in numerous renewable energy conversion technologies. However, its sluggish intrinsic kinetics and intricate transfer process impede the efficient conversion of energy. Activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is of paramount importance to break through the theoretical scaling relationship and boost the oxygen evolution catalytic activity. In this contribution, N and F are successfully introduced into Co3O4 simultaneously as heteroatoms via a controllable plasma strategy to modulate the covalency property of metal&#8208;oxygen. Theoretical simulations and experiment results demonstrated that the covalency of the cobalt&#8208;oxygen bond is significantly enhanced under the synergistic effect of N and F, successfully triggering the LOM pathway and facilitating the OER process. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 composite displays an impressive OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 254&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability at 20, 150, and 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 also exhibits&#160;a low overpotential of 285&#160;mV at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH + 0.5&#160;m NaCl solution, and remarkable performance on overall water splitting. This work offers profound insights into the OER mechanism and a crucial strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxides.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Closed&#8208;Pore Size on Rate Capability of Hard Carbon for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between closed&#8208;pore size and Na&#8208;filling potentials and their influence on fast charging performance is unveiled. Smaller closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, thereby preventing Na plating at high current rates. A 2.2 Ah pouch cell incorporating optimizes hard carbon material with closed micropores (1.6 nm) and P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes enables 10 min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity.








Abstract
The sluggish Na ion diffusion kinetics and Na metal plating in hard carbon negative electrodes restrict the fast&#8208;charging of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is intricately entwined with the crystal structure and pore structure. Here, the pore structures of hard carbon materials are focused on and reveal that the pore size significantly affects the Na&#8208;filling potentials during the sodiation process. Specifically, the micro closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, which reduces risks of Na metal plating at high current densities, thus enabling improved rate performance. As a result, the optimized hard carbon with closed micropores (1.6&#160;nm) achieves an initial capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a plateau retention rate of 73.3% at a current density of 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Paired with P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes, the 2.2 Ah pouch cell shows 10&#160;min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity and &#8776;90% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at a 6C rate. This work establishes a bridge between pore size and rate performance, offering guidance for the design of fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>V&#8208;O&#8208;Ru Heterogeneous Interphase Reversible Reconstruction Endowing Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O/0.65RuO2 Cathode Robust H+/Zn2+ Storage</title>

A ZVO/RuO2 cathode is designed by coupling Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO) and RuO2 through interfacial V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds in which a dynamic reversible breakage and reconstruction of V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru, which provide a reversible electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO, making RuO2 as an additional electron acceptor and donor, accelerating the migration kinetics of H+/Zn2+ in ZVO.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type layered vanadium oxides have been widely explored as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, attaining both high power density and superior stability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, layered vanadium oxides are pre&#8208;intercalated with Zn2+ to form Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO), which is then combined with RuO2 nanoparticles to construct a ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure featuring interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds. ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure exhibits a dynamic stable coupling at the interphase via V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru chemical bonds reconstruction during discharging/charging processes. The dynamically reversible reconstruction of interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds provides a fast electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO cathode, as demonstrated by ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, making RuO2 an additional electron acceptor and donor, and accelerating the migration of H+/Zn2+ in layered ZVO cathode. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;high capacity (411 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (a retention of 92.2% at 20 A g&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles) performances are achieved. This interphase reversible reconstruction route provides a promising approach to achieving excellent cycling stability in cathode materials.

         <title>Promoting Phase Transition in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites For High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films have a wide phase component distribution. Yu et&#160;al. show that introducing acetate anions promote the in situ phase transition from low&#8208;n to high&#8208;n phases. The enhanced phase transformation efficiency enables high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission peak of 641 nm and peak external quantum efficiency of 25.3%.








Abstract
Layered quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D)&#160;halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence. Narrowing the multi&#8208;quantum well distribution and eliminating wide&#8208;bandgap 2D phases are crucial for achieving a flat energy landscape, minimizing energy loss, and ensuring high&#8208;color&#8208;purity emission. Here, it is demonstrated that solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with broad component distributions arise from an incomplete kinetic transition from low&#8208;n (n, quantum well thickness) to high&#8208;n phases. To address this, an acetate anion treatment strategy is proposed, which induces competitive coordination between the acetate anion, the bulky spacer cation, and the inorganic layer, thereby facilitating the insertion of octahedral precursor ions and promoting phase transition. This treatment results in quasi&#8208;2D films with enhanced color purity, efficient energy transfer, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi&#8208;2D films for different emission wavelengths.

         <title>Pairing N&#8208;Vacancy and Adjacent Ni&#8208;Sites in the Local Microenvironment to Regulate the Urea Oxidation Reaction Pathway With Enhanced Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nitrogen vacancies&#8208;rich nickel nitride (Ni3N&#8208;VN), a local microenvironment of nitrogen vacancies and adjacent Ni sites is formed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites can be converted to NiOOH at a lower potential, and urea adsorption on the electron&#8208;deficient nitrogen vacancy region is conducive to its partial dissociation, conceiving to efficient urea oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites on Ni3N (Ni3N&#8208;VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward &#8220;NCO&#8315;&#8221; formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N&#8208;VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.

Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Perspective on the Origin of High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolytes</title>

This perspective critically examines HE approaches in SEs, highlighting how compositional complexity induces system disorder and local&#8208;structure evolution to enhance stability and properties. While HE concepts are attractive, establishing rigorous structure&#8208;property relationships requires further investigation. The discussion aims to guide future research in this promising field by clarifying key challenges and opportunities in HE&#8208;based electrolyte design.








Abstract
As the key material for the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted increasing attention. Recently, a novel design strategy&#8722;high&#8208;entropy (HE) approach is frequently reported to improve the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of SEs. However, the fundamental understandings on the HE working mechanism and applicability evaluation of HE concept are deficient, which would impede the sustainable development of a desirable strategy to enable high&#8208;performance SEs. In this contribution, the essence of HE&#8208;related approaches and their positive effects on SEs are evaluated. The reported HE strategy stems from complex compositional regulations. The derived structural stability and enhanced property are originally from the modulated system disorder and subtle local&#8208;structure evolutions, respectively. While HE ardently describes the increased entropy/disorder during the modification of prevailing SEs, rigorous experimental formulations, and direct correlations between the HE structures and desired properties are necessary to be established. This perspective would be a timely and critical overview for the HE approaches in the context of SEs, aiming to stimulate further discussion and exploration in this emerging research direction.

         <title>Halide Chemistry Boosts All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide chemistry is an emerging approach in promoting the kinetics of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs). In this perspective, the distinct roles of halide chemistry are discussed at both the cathode and anode, analyzing the atomic arrangement, phase composition, and morphology evolution in various halogenation strategies. further research and broad discussion of halogenation strategies are expected to inspire ASSLSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost and high energy density. Their solid&#8208;state configuration effectively eliminates the notorious shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides in conventional liquid electrolytes. However, the heterogeneous solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid interfaces introduce significant challenges, including sluggish ion/electron transport and interfacial instability among electrode materials, conductive additives, and solid electrolytes (SEs). Recently, halide&#8208;based strategies have gained attention for enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs. This perspective highlights these strategies, emphasizing the role of halide chemistry in enhancing ASSLSB kinetics. It is contended that halides (e.g., iodides) in sulfur&#8208;based cathode composites&#8212;such as Li2S and transition metal sulfides&#8212;can activate S/Li2S redox reactions, improving both ionic and electronic conductivities. This &#8220;catalytic effect&#8221; of halides accelerates the reversible transition, even in the absence of conductive additives like SEs or conductive carbons. Moreover, halides at the anode interface play a crucial role in preventing Li dendrite formation and SE degradation, owing to their large polarizability and high interfacial energy. This perspective provides a timely and insightful summary of halide chemistry's impact on ASSLSB kinetics, offering inspiration for further research and broader adoption of halide&#8208;based strategies in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitation&#8208;Modulated Multi&#8208;Color Three&#8208;photon Excited Luminescence in Ln&#8208;MOF Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy toward realizing multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework heterostructure has been developed through a novel hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping method. The as&#8208;obtained heterostructure with wide MPEL color gamut and great up&#8208;conversion luminescent anisotropy is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation is of great application value for optoelectronics, especially MPEL with the characteristics of multi&#8208;color emission and optical anisotropy. However, it still suffers from the obstacles in highly&#8208;integrating and orientedly&#8208;assembly of various MPEL units. Herein, a hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping strategy is proposed to establish a novel lanthanide&#8208;graded metal&#8208;organic framework based heterostructure. Well&#8208;designed ligand and Ln3+ ions are respectively selected as the MPEL energy donor and acceptor units (MEDU and MEAU). Through utilizing the effective energy transfer between them, the as&#8208;obtained triblock heterostructure displays multi&#8208;dimensional three&#8208;photon excited luminescence (3PEL) modulation, where the emission band and intensity can be switched by manipulating excited regions and excitation polarization based on a single pump source. This is attributed to the precise integration and orientation of photonic units. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits multi&#8208;color 3PEL with a record&#8208;high MPEL color gamut (&gt;30% of sRGB area) in MOFs and high degree of linear polarization values (max &#8776;88.6%). Such anisotropic 3PEL modulation shows promising potential in nonlinear optical switches, programmable logic gates, and multi&#8208;level optical barcodes. These findings open up an intriguing way to develop up&#8208;conversion luminescent materials with functions on demand toward photonic modulation.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Sustainable 4D Printing of Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composites for Autonomous Task Execution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur&#8208;rich polymer composites is demonstrated for the first time using loosely crosslinked poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic composites (MPSNs). 3D&#8208;printed PSNs and MPSNs exhibit shape&#8208;morphing capabilities and can be directly reprinted into new form factors and magneto&#8208;responsive soft robots. 3D&#8208;printed MPSNs can serve as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasable stirring bar for chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;programmable polymer networks derived from waste elemental sulfur hold great potential for diverse applications such as 4D printing and soft robotics. However, their crosslinked nature makes it challenging to 3D print complex geometry for soft robots. Herein, a closed&#8208;loop 4D printing strategy is reported of poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic particle composites (MPSNs) to fabricate multi&#8208;functional soft robots with programmable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities. The dynamic S&#9472;S bonds within the loosely crosslinked PSNs impart shear&#8208;thinning behavior, enabling hot&#8208;melt extrusion of both PSNs and MPSNs into complex architectures. After shape&#8208;programming, 3D&#8208;printed PSN and MPSN structures exhibit heat&#8208; or light&#8208;triggered shape recovery and allow modular assembly for spatially selective shape&#8208;morphing governed by the distinct glass transition temperatures of the PSN series. These architectures can be readily reprinted into new form factors, demonstrating a closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing. With multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness and solvent resistance provided by the PSN composites, the MPSN capsule serves as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasing magnetic stirring bar in a reagent&#8208;containing solution, autonomously releasing catalysts at a preset temperature to facilitate carbamate synthesis. The 4D printable MPSNs offer a sustainable platform not only for adaptable shape&#8208;morphing and dynamic actuation but also for autonomous task execution in next&#8208;generation soft robotic applications.

         <title>Graphdiyne Production in a Flash: High&#8208;Yield Direct Synthesis by Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work creatively introduces an electron beam irradiation strategy that enables the deprotection&#8208;free synthesis of GDY directly from HEB&#8208;TMS under ambient conditions, achieving almost 100% yields within seconds&#8212;the shortest time reported to date, to the best of the&#160;knowledge. This ultrafast and efficient method significantly improves over traditional approaches, which often require hours or days of thermal treatment.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, holds immense potential for diverse applications but is severely constrained by relatively complex and time&#8208;intensive synthesis methods. Here, a novel electron beam irradiation strategy is reported that enables the ultrafast and scalable synthesis of GDY directly from its protected monomer, hexakis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS), under ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of the direct use of electron beam irradiation in carbon materials synthesis, achieving the shortest synthesis time for GDY from HEB&#8208;TMS reported to date. This unprecedented efficiency arises from the rapid in situ formation of copper acetylide intermediates, followed by electron&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage to generate alkynyl radicals that undergo efficient homo&#8208;coupling into GDY. Moreover, this flash approach enables the in situ formation of uniformly dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles on GDY, resulting in a composite with exceptional efficiency and stability for the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. By providing a green, scalable, and efficient synthetic route, this work not only marks a leap toward GDY production but also establishes a versatile platform for designing GDY&#8208;based catalysts, paving the way for broader applications and industrial&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Grayscale Digital Light Processing for Mechanically Robust 3D&#8208;Printed Gradient Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning&#8208;driven grayscale digital light processing (g&#8208;DLP) platform integrates optimization of gradient structures and photocurable resin materials with extensive tunability. The optimized gradient structure, fabricated from developed polyurethane acrylates with enhanced damping and customizable stiffness, reduces stress concentration, confirming the mechanical robustness of the g&#8208;DLP platform. This technology offers versatile solutions for applications, ranging from biomedical to automotive.








Abstract
Grayscale digital light processing (g&#8208;DLP) is gaining recognition for its capability to create material property gradients within a single resin system, enabling programmable mechanical responses, enhanced shape accuracy, and improved toughness. However, research on the mechanical robustness of g&#8208;DLP is constrained by the limited range of tailorable properties in photocurable resins and insufficient exploration of structural optimization for complex geometries. This study presents a synergistic g&#8208;DLP strategy that integrates the synthesis of dynamic bond&#8208;controlled polyurethane acrylate (PUA) with a machine learning&#8208;based multi&#8208;objective optimization, enabling mechanically robust 3D&#8208;printed gradient materials. A PUA&#8208;based resin system is developed that expands the achievable elastic modulus from 8.3&#160;MPa to 1.2&#160;GPa, while maintaining superior damping performance, making it suitable for diverse applications. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization framework is constructed to efficiently identify optimal gradient structures, reducing strain concentrations and controlling effective stiffness. This approach is applicable to various 3D and arbitrary geometries, achieving a significant strain concentration reduction of up to 83% and demonstrating delayed crack initiation. By combining the developed material with this optimization framework, a versatile platform is established for creating mechanically robust g&#8208;DLP printed components, applicable in areas ranging from biomimetic artificial cartilage to automotive energy&#8208;absorbing structures.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode by Ion Flux Regulation and Micro&#8208;Corrosion Zone Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited reversibility of Zn anodes remains a key challenge impeding the practical development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous strategies&#8212;such as solvation&#8208;regulating additives and water&#8208;blocking surface coatings&#8212;are explored, they often face inherent limitations. In this work, a novel additive, ZnABL, synthesized via keto&#8208;enol isomerization, is introduced. ZnABL exhibits strong adsorption on the zinc surface and function through dual mechanisms: regulating Zn ion flux and spatially isolating micro&#8208;corrosion zones to mitigate zinc anode corrosion, finally improving the Zn anode reversibility. The method introduced in this paper offers valuable insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are receiving continuous attention as candidates for the next generation batteries, but the poor reversibility of the Zn anode limits their further development. In recent years, researchers are obsessed with modifying the surface of the Zn anode and adjusting the solvation structure of Zn2+ to address these challenges. Here, we propose a novel strategy to improve the reversibility of the Zn anode by simultaneously regulating the Zn ion flux and dividing micro&#8208;corrosion zones on the Zn anode surface, thereby manipulating the deposition behavior of Zn2+ and relieving the corrosion of the Zn anode. This approach exploits the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (ABL) to develop a specifically designed additive: Zn2+ coordinated &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone complex (ZnABL). With this innovative additive, the Zn anodes show excellent reversibility: Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves a long cycle life of 7780&#160;h (&#8776;11 months). Furthermore, the Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;H2O near&#8208;ampere&#8208;hour pouch cell, featuring a high areal capacity of 7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2, achieved an energy density of 106.17&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and sustained more than 350 cycles. The success of ZnABL in modulating the Zn ion flux and compartmentalizing the micro&#8208;corrosion zone provides a novel option for the reversibility improvement of Zn anodes.

         <title>Biomimetic Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Scaffolds for Enhanced Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the development and use of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds in tissue engineering. Bioinspired phospholipid and glycocalyx coatings enhance anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;thrombogenic, and selective molecular recognition properties. Native cell membrane coatings further support cell&#8208;specific interactions, immune modulation, and reduced bacterial adhesion. Recent advances in skin, bone, neural, and vascular regeneration highlight their broad therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Cell membranes are emerging as valuable models for regulating scaffold&#8208;cell interactions in tissue engineering. Their unique structure and function provide an ideal template for creating biomimetic surfaces that support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This has led to the development of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds (CMCSs), a new class of biomaterials designed to mimic native cellular interfaces and improve therapeutic outcomes. This review begins with an overview of cell&#8211;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, highlighting their key roles in tissue remodeling and healing. It then introduces ECM&#8208;inspired coatings before focusing on CMCSs. A detailed analysis of scaffolds coated with specific membrane components or entire cell membranes is presented, with applications in skin and wound healing, bone regeneration, neural repair, and vascular grafts. Techniques for membrane extraction, surface functionalization, and preservation of membrane integrity and orientation are analyzed. CMCSs demonstrate advantages over traditional scaffolds, including improved homotypic cell attraction, immune modulation, and resistance to non&#8208;specific protein and bacterial adhesion. However, several challenges persist, such as standardizing membrane isolation methods, optimizing coating density, and evaluating the stability and reproducibility of coatings, especially when using hybrid membranes from multiple cell types. Overcoming these barriers could significantly advance scaffold technologies for regenerative medicine.

LPBC stimulates transcriptional enhancement for biohydrogen production, and targets NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase to catalyze intracellular tandem reactions for directional electron modulation, achieving a 103% production rate increase with 30&#8208;day long&#8208;lasting performance.








Abstract
Biohydrogen production offers a promising pathway for developing clean and renewable energy sources. However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy&#8208;efficient and output&#8208;sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self&#8208;assembling intermetallic (L10) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with Clostridium pasteurianum. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare C. pasteurianum system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Alternating Interlayered Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Heterojunction Boosts Sono&#8208;Piezocatalytic Pyroptosis Oncotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrative alternating&#8208;layered piezoelectronic nano&#8208;architecture has debuted, markedly enhancing ultrasound&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency and electron&#8208;storage capacity via robust electron confinement and heterojunction&#8208;mediated charge separation. Demonstrating catalytic and piezoelectric superiority over 29 benchmark nanocatalysts, this approach elevates microregional bio&#8208;responsiveness by amplifying atomic&#8208;level piezocatalytic mechanisms. These findings not only bridge catalysis with biomedical applications but also hold substantial promises for renewable energy conversion, environmental remediation, and advanced electron&#8208;transfer technologies.








Abstract
Recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers is a major barrier hindering the effectiveness of piezocatalytic oncotherapy. Herein, ultrathin oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered self&#8208;heterojunction bismuth oxysilicate (Ov&#8208;BOS) nanosheets with alternating hetero&#8208;layered nanostructure are constructed for enhanced sono&#8208;piezocatalytic tumor therapy. Benefiting from its out&#8208;of&#8208;plane asymmetry, Ov&#8208;BOS features an exceptional electromechanical strain coefficient (d*33 = 203 pm/V), highlighting its outstanding capability as a piezoelectric heterojunction for energy conversion. Particularly, the oxygen vacancy engineering facilitates the spatial redistribution of bands across the alternating [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers in Ov&#8208;BOS, promoting effective charge separation and stratified charge storage, thereby further suppressing recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers in a manner analogous to heterojunctions. Leveraging this strategy, Ov&#8208;BOS demonstrates efficient reactive oxygen species production and exhibits superior peroxidase and catalase&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional piezoelectric nanocatalysts. Consequently, the enhanced radical generation induced the specific cancer&#8208;cell pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 mediated gasdermin E&#8208;dependent pathway. Therefore, the engineered interlayer self&#8208;heterojunction provides an efficient strategy for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance piezoelectric nanocatalysts.

         <title>Fibrous Pressure Sensor with Unique Resistance Increase under Partial Compression: Coaxial Wet&#8208;Spun TiO2/Graphene/Thermoplastic Polyurethane Multi&#8208;Wall Multifunctional Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TGTMW fibers are designed to show a sharp resistance increase under pressure, as the multi&#8208;wall structure in the transition region between compressed and uncompressed areas bends and forms microcracks. This design breaks the physical sensitivity limit of conventional fiber&#8208;shaped pressure sensors, which usually show resistance reduction under pressure and are constrained by their series structure under partial compression.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure&#8208;sensitive sensors are rare. Although fibers are widely used in strain sensors owing to their structural advantages, developing fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure sensors is challenging. This challenge arises because the fiber acts as a series circuit along its axis, requiring increased resistance in the compressed region for a significant signal. Coaxial wet&#8208;spinning is used to create a multi&#8208;walled fiber. The outer layer, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/TiO2 slurry, ensured a smooth surface, while the inner core, containing 4% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), is extruded at 20&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1. Unlike conventional resistance&#8208;increasing pressure sensors, TGTMW fiber shows rising resistance under compression due to microcracks in its multi&#8208;wall structure. Its pressure sensitivity is evaluated using various 3D&#8208;printed indenters and showcasing its excellent performance. This sensor has found promising applications in remote motion detection, press or slide differentiation through wavelet transforms applied to high&#8208;speed sensing data, and real&#8208;time signal acquisition from a multi&#8208;channel sensing array. Additionally, intuitive visualization software is developed for the sensing array application and implemented a CNN&#8208;based machine learning algorithm for data analysis. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of &#8776;99.6% for 12 different compression modes. This work is believed to propose a new mechanism and design for fiber&#8208;based pressure sensors.

         <title>Giant Circularly Polarized Luminescence Driven by Excited&#8208;State Hybridization Between Molecular Emitters and Chiral Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental chiroptical response amplification mechanism is revealed to massively enhance molecular helicene chiral emitters. The luminescent dissymmetry factor of the helicene emitter is amplified by 133 times through excited&#8208;state hybridization with a polymeric chiral environment. The amplification mechanism does not rely on a specific energy transfer process, therefore offering new paths for the design of chiral emissive systems.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) light is extensively used in various fields such as asymmetrical synthesis, sensing, and advanced displays. Consequently, significant efforts have been made to develop chiral materials that intrinsically emit CP light with a large dissymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). It is widely considered that the dissymmetry factor for individual organic emitters, due to the amplitude offset between their electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, is limited to &#8776;10&#8722;2, which is inadequate for practical applications. Recent efforts to enhance CP light emission have therefore focused on amplifying the dissymmetry of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), often via specific energy transfer processes. Here, a fundamental mechanism is discovered &#8211; excited&#8208;state hybridization, which amplifies CPL through excitonic coupling without relying on energy transfer processes. Through this wavefunction hybridization, both the amplitude and sign of the rotatory strength related to the molecular emitter's electronic transition are modified to align with its chiral environment, remarkably boosting the CP luminescence from an intrinsic dissymmetry factor of &#8722;10&#8722;3 up to +0.40. This breakthrough allows for more versatile design strategies for chiral emissive systems, moving beyond designs limited to energy transfer processes and paving the way for new approaches to achieve strong CP emissive materials.

Abstract
Solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) hold significant promise as a sustainable energy conversion technology due to their high efficiency and minimal environmental impact. However, their development faces critical challenges, particularly in achieving dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes necessary to fully leverage state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cobaltite&#8208;based oxygen electrodes. In this study, a microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering process is successfully employed as a transformative alternative to the conventional, time&#8208;intensive sintering approach, enabling the fabrication of highly dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes. This innovative method reduced processing time by over 30&#8208;fold compared to convection sintering and achieved a record&#8208;low sintering temperature of 1200&#160;&#176;C. SOCs fabricated with these volumetric heating&#8208;engineered bilayer electrolytes demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance, delivering a maximum power density of 2.43&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.16&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 750&#160;&#176;C in electrolysis mode, alongside excellent long&#8208;term durability. Furthermore, advanced digital twin analysis revealed the critical correlation between microstructural features and electrochemical performance, providing new insights into SOC optimization. This work highlights the potential of microwave&#8208;assisted sintering as a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for advancing high&#8208;performance SOC technologies.

         <title>Quantitatively Predicting Angle&#8208;Resolved Polarized Raman Intensity of Anisotropic Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops comprehensive methodologies to predict angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity profiles of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), spanning from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit. By considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference, the complex refractive indexes and intrinsic Raman tensors are determined, offering a robust framework for ARPR analysis of ALM flakes across various dielectric structures.








Abstract
Angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy provides insights into optical anisotropy and symmetry&#8208;related electron&#8211;photon/electron&#8211;phonon couplings of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs). However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (&#10878;20 nm) flakes and four&#8208;layer Td&#8208;WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically&#8208;thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in&#8208;plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, are derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer&#8208;dependent electronic&#160;properties.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Like&#8208;Phase Confined Interfacial Polymerization: A Universal Platform for the Controlled 2D Growth of COP Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic abstract illustrates a solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) mechanism, which modulates substrate hydration, solvent density, and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions to localize Tp monomers at the substrate surface. This SLCIP strategy stabilizes the reaction interface, enabling confined 2D polymerization of the COP membrane within a restricted zone, ensuring controlled membrane growth and enhanced separation performance.








Abstract
The scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance covalent organic framework/polymer (COF/COP) membranes faces persistent challenges due to interfacial instability in conventional liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial polymerization (LLIP). Here, a transformative solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) strategy is developed that synergizes substrate hydration&#8208;induced confinement and functionalization&#8208;enabled monomer anchoring for synthesizing ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COP membranes. By orchestrating the hydration barrier and solvent density modulation at functionalized substrates, SLCIP converts the dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid interface into a stable solid&#8210;like phase confined interface. This interfacial confinement engineering enables the ambient synthesis of unique ultrathin COP membranes (&lt;40&#160;nm) via confined 2D reaction zones (1.2&#160;nm thickness via MD simulations). The resulting membranes achieve a record water permeance (161 L m&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; bar&#8315;&#185;, 3.7&#8208;fold enhancement over LLIP), with &gt;98.8% Congo red rejection. Systematic implementation across three solvent systems and five structurally diverse amine monomers demonstrates the universality and chemical adaptability of SLCIP. Industrial scalability is validated through pilot&#8208;scale fabrication of A4&#8208;sized membranes with &lt;5% spatial performance deviation. This work establishes an ambient&#8208;processable interfacial engineering paradigm, offering a sustainable platform for next&#8208;generation molecular separation technologies.

         <title>Robust Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered Co(OH)2/Cu Heterostructures Boost Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia beyond 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy is proposed to engineer robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched Co(OH)2/Cu heterostructures, which boosts hydrogen supply and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting *NO2 to *NOOH step via oxygen vacancy incorporation, thereby enabling high&#8208;current&#8208;density, scalable, and practical NH3 electrosynthesis. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a sustainable paradigm for green NH3 synthesis and NO3&#8722; wastewater valorization. However, overcoming sluggish NO3RR kinetics under industrial&#8208;current operation persists as a critical challenge. Herein, robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched heterostructures (Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2/Cu) are engineered through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. By coupling Cu&#8208;mediated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion with Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;accelerated NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation, this heterostructured system delivers an unprecedented NH3 yield rate of 167.8 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and 97.7% Faradaic efficiency at &gt;2 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining exceptional current tolerance over 25 h. Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ov in Co(OH)2 synergistically accelerates water dissociation to ensure continuous hydrogen supply and optimizes *NOOH adsorption, reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting step (*NO2 to *NOOH). To demonstrate practical viability, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer integrating NO3RR with glycerol oxidation reaction achieves highly effective co&#8208;production of NH3 and formate alongside wastewater treatment. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for scalable and practical NO3RR applications.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Achieving Efficient Phosphorescent Carbon Nanodots in Aqueous Solution by Suppressing Triplet Electron Leakage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning reveals that increasing matrix thickness reduces triplet exciton leakage, establishing a data&#8208;guided design paradigm for water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent CNDs with ultrahigh efficiency. 








Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted synthesis has emerged as a prevalent strategy for the fabrication of solid&#8208;state phosphorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs), yet achieving efficient liquid&#8208;phase CND systems remains challenging due to complex underlying mechanisms. The knowledge gap poses a substantial barrier to translating phosphorescent CND systems between solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;phase configurations. Herein, the critical role of triplet electron leakage is elucidated in reducing the phosphorescent performance of CNDs and demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can be applied to suppress this leakage, achieving efficient phosphorescent CNDs in aqueous solution. By integrating experimental datasets from hundreds of systematically designed syntheses, an interpretable ML model capable of predicting and tuning phosphorescence lifetimes in CND systems is developed. The quantitative relationships between features and lifetimes using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are established, revealing an inverse correlation between matrix thickness and the probability of triplet electron leakage.

     alt="Machine Learning-Driven Achieving Efficient Phosphorescent Carbon Nanodots in Aqueous Solution by Suppressing Triplet Electron Leakage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning reveals that increasing matrix thickness reduces triplet exciton leakage, establishing a data-guided design paradigm for water-soluble phosphorescent CNDs with ultrahigh efficiency. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix-assisted synthesis has emerged as a prevalent strategy for the fabrication of solid-state phosphorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs), yet achieving efficient liquid-phase CND systems remains challenging due to complex underlying mechanisms. The knowledge gap poses a substantial barrier to translating phosphorescent CND systems between solid-state and liquid-phase configurations. Herein, the critical role of triplet electron leakage is elucidated in reducing the phosphorescent performance of CNDs and demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can be applied to suppress this leakage, achieving efficient phosphorescent CNDs in aqueous solution. By integrating experimental datasets from hundreds of systematically designed syntheses, an interpretable ML model capable of predicting and tuning phosphorescence lifetimes in CND systems is developed. The quantitative relationships between features and lifetimes using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are established, revealing an inverse correlation between matrix thickness and the probability of triplet electron leakage. Guided by the developed ML model, efficient phosphorescent CNDs are achieved in aqueous solution with an emission duration lifetime of exceeding10&#160;s and a phosphorescent quantum yield of over 10%. This study establishes a conceptual and methodological framework for engineering high-performance phosphorescent nanomaterials in liquid-phase systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Coordination Engineering to Boost Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Economic Zr&#8208;Based Halide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a coordination&#8208;driven amorphization strategy is employed to construct oxide&#8208;halide composite electrolytes by integrating Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) into Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO). The resulting composite electrolyte delivers high ionic conductivity, improved oxidative stability, and excellent cycling performance in ASSLBs, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable route toward high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (HSEs) have seen rapid progress in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), offering favorable lithium&#8208;ion transport properties, broad electrochemical stability, and strong interfacial compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. However, developing HSEs that simultaneously offer high ionic conductivity and low cost remains a significant challenge. Most high&#8208;conductivity halides rely on expensive metal elements, whereas cost&#8208;effective Zr&#8208;based halides are limited by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In this study, a new composite electrolyte (LA/LZCO) is developed via an interfacial coordination reaction between Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP). The coordination between PO43&#8722; groups in LATP and Zr4+ in LZCO induces local structural disorder, promoting LZCO amorphization. As a result, the ionic conductivity of LA/LZCO composite electrolyte is enhanced by more than twofold compared to LZCO, reaching 2.81 mS cm&#8722;1, among one of the highest reported for Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes. When integrated into ASSLBs with NCM83125 cathodes, the composite electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability, with 92.4% and 87.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C under 4.25&#160;V. Even at an elevated cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, 85.1% capacity is retained after 380 cycles, highlighting the promise of this composite strategy for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLBs.

         <title>Exploring Anionic Redox Chemistry of Battery Cathodes with Resonant Inelastic X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering is a crucial technique for energy storage and energy sustainability due to its superior resolution and uniqueness for studying the anionic redox in cathode materials. This Perspective presents the powerful edges of RIXS as well as its promising capabilities such as imaging and in situ options that further advance the development of battery research.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity and reversible cathodes are important for sustainable energy development. Layered oxides present promising options, achieving a high capacity while maintaining manageable production costs. Despite the redox activity of transition metal primarily contributes to the capacity, anionic redox offers additional potential, as evidenced by the subtle voltage plateau at high voltage. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the reversibility of anionic redox, resulting in voltage fade, hysteresis, and the formation of undesired oxygen species. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (RIXS) captures not only the charge transfer processes between oxygen ligands and transition metals but also the formation of molecular oxygen, elucidating the chemical transformations of oxygen during electrochemical cycles. Mapping capability allows for the generation of spectral patterns with quantitative measures that surpass those achievable by other characterization techniques. Though early reports on its advantages, a comprehensive discussion of RIXS and its perspectives on anionic redox processes in cathode materials remains absent but necessary. This perspective aims to provide a systematic overview of RIXS, emphasizing its unique contributions to cathode material research. It also serves as a valuable reference for energy researchers and RIXS practitioners, featuring the advancements and future possibilities of this powerful technique.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Borohydride Doping in Electrochemical Stability of Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how LiBH4 doping in argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte improves electrochemical stability by forming a tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that promotes ion transport and blocks electrons. In situ XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS show thinner SEI, enhanced Li electrodeposition, and better interfacial wetting compared to baseline LPSCl, highlighting the role of B&#8208;rich layers in interface engineering.









Abstract
This work elucidates the mechanism by which lithium borohydride (LiBH4) doping into argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl (LBH&#8208;LPSCl) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) enhances electrochemical stability. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance is achieved with 5 wt% borohydride. Symmetric cells achieve critical current density (CCD) of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2, versus 2.6 mA cm&#8722;2 for baseline&#8208;LPSCl. All solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing lithium metal and NMC811 cathode are stable over 400 cycles at 0.5C, with capacity retention of 83%. An anode&#8208;free ASSB (AF&#8208;ASSB) is stable over 600 cycles, with capacity loss of 0.04% per cycle. 5LBH&#8208;LPSCl allows for enhanced low temperature operation, down to &#8722;14&#160;&#176;C. Yet the difference in electrolytes&#8217; bulk microstructures and hardnesses are minimal, while ionic conductivity is incrementally improved (&#8776;50%). Theoretical modeling indicates limited effect of substitution on thermodynamic stability of PS43&#8722; units, which decompose when contacting Li. Instead, enhanced electrochemical stability is site&#8208;specific kinetic effect: In situ electrodeposition experiments using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) reveal tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that blocks electrons while facilitating ion transport. This SEI manifests reduced interface resistance and accelerated nucleation and growth of metallic Li. With baseline&#8208;LPSCl the SEI based on Li3P/Li2S is substantially thicker, generating localized stresses that promote interfacial cracking while cycling.

         <title>A Gas Nanobomb to Promote Drug Penetration and Amplify TACE Therapy for Orthotopic Liver Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional embolic agent is successfully synthesized with the introduction of magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanoparticles into lipiodol (Lip) &amp;tirapazamine (TPZ) dispersion for efficient supply H2, OH&#8722;, and Mg2+. The L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension demonstrates effective elimination of primary tumors, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and recurrence when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transarterial embolization by L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.








Abstract
The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH2) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co&#8208;dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH2 nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH2 nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&#8722; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H2) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen&#8208;based chemotherapy; and Mg2+ synergistically regulates T&#8208;cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H2 and Mg2+&#8208;induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH2 nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.

Transarterial embolization by L-MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co-dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L-MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen-based chemotherapy; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; synergistically regulates T-cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L-MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creep Localization Empowering High&#8208;Capacity Alloy Anodes for Durable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible In0.32Sn0.48Bi0.20 alloy anode with a titanium mesh having a high area moment of inertia is introduced. This approach effectively addresses electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation in ASSLBs under industrial conditions, enabling LiCoO2||Ti&#8208;InSnBi full&#8208;cells with exceptional energy densities exceeding 350 Wh kg&#8722;1, fast&#8208;charging capabilities up to 30.57 mA cm&#8722;2, and low stack pressures (3 MPa).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity alloy anodes (Si, Al, and Sn) promise critical materials for developing high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, their implementation remains fundamentally constrained by severe interfacial stress, large volume changes, and high stack pressures. Here, a novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy is proposed to address these intrinsic limitations by coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible (InSn4)0.37&#183;(InBi)0.63 alloy anode with a titanium mesh possessing a high area moment of inertia. The investigations reveal a synergistic interface stabilization mechanism: InSnBi undergoes adaptive creep to maintain ionic&#8208;electronic interpenetrating networks, while the titanium framework, through its flexural rigidity, redistributes localized stress and prevents heterogeneous stress concentrations from driving InSnBi creep toward the cathode. This hierarchical stress management mechanism ensures stable cycling by accommodating substantial volume fluctuations, thereby enabling ASSLBs to realize stable cycling at high loading (23.05 mAh cm&#8722;2) and low stack pressures (3&#160;MPa), respectively. Remarkably, the as&#8208;assembled LiCoO2||InSnBi full&#8208;cell with a capacity of 5.56 mAh cm&#8722;2 maintains a retention of 81.6% over 3000 cycles at a 2C rate. This work presents a new paradigm for addressing the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling degradation of ASSLBs, representing a milestone advancement for developing high&#8208;energy ASSLBs.

A schematic illustration of how noble metals can be used to create nanoparticles (NPs) or nanoclusters (NCs).

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons. This has opened the path toward more powerful biomedical applications, including surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing. A comprehensive outlook on the evolution of plasmonic&#8208;based materials for the next therapies is provided.

         <title>Cottonseed&#8208;Derived Reusable Bio&#8208;Carbon Gel Ink for DIW Printing Soft Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

Pressure Sensors
The cover image illustrates how side&#8208;chain&#8208;doped polymers undergo molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbation under pressure. This pressure&#8208;induced phenomenon enhances carrier lifetime, leading to improved electrical conductivity in the material. The sensor is further integrated with convolutional neural networks to create an intelligent vocal recognition system, achieving over 96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pressure Sensors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover image illustrates how side-chain-doped polymers undergo molecular rearrangement and charge-density perturbation under pressure. This pressure-induced phenomenon enhances carrier lifetime, leading to improved electrical conductivity in the material. The sensor is further integrated with convolutional neural networks to create an intelligent vocal recognition system, achieving over 96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles.

Photoimmunotherapy
In article number 2501184, Yuqi Tang, Dan Xiang, and Quan Li report a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles. These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. This unique structural transformation enhances the nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.

Friction Behavior of Hydrogels
In article number 2417177, Kai Zhang, Jiuling Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal that water evaporation from hydrogel surfaces in open&#8208;air conditions reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. Optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. This work provides guidelines for designing hydrogel materials with excellent lubrication properties.

Sprayable Hydrogel
This study designs a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) to treat non&#8208;compressible hemorrhage. Functionalized with GFOGER and GGQQLK peptides, PLNs synergistically mimic natural hemostasis via platelet adherence and aggregation, Ca2+/DSPS&#8208;mediated prothrombin activation and fibrin network stabilization. The biomimetic system enables rapid clot formation by sequential coordinating primary hemostasis, coagulation amplification and fibrin reinforcement. More details can be found in article number 2500908 by Yang Li, Chenhui Zhu, Daidi Fan, and co&#8208;workers.

Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron
In article number 2417793 by Nazek El&#8208;Atab and co&#8208;workers, a multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS2/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 108 with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in&#8208;situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Engineering Magnetotactic Bacteria as Medical Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are living microorganisms that produce magnetosomes for navigation using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for making future living and programmable microrobots. This review highlights recent advances in MTB&#8208;based microrobotics, detailing their interactions with magnetic fields, propulsion mechanisms, motion control, and emerging strategies for engineering and functionalizing MTB for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nature's ability to create complex and functionalized organisms has long inspired engineers and scientists to develop increasingly advanced machines. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram&#8208;negative prokaryotes that biomineralize iron and thrive in aquatic environments, have garnered significant attention from the bioengineering community. These bacteria possess chains of magnetic nanocrystals known as magnetosomes, which allow them to align with Earth's geomagnetic field and navigate through aquatic environments via magnetotaxis, enabling localization to areas rich in nutrients and optimal oxygen concentration. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for future medical microrobots. Leveraging an externally applied magnetic field, the motion of MTBs can be precisely controlled, rendering them suitable for use as a new type of biohybrid microrobotics with great promise in medicine for bioimaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatment, and detoxification. This mini&#8208;review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent advancements in MTB microrobots, delineates the interaction between MTB microrobots and magnetic fields, elucidates propulsion mechanisms and motion control, and reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for modifying and functionalizing MTB for medical applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials and Soft Robotic Actuators for Bioelectronic Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the integration of responsive materials and soft robotic actuators with implantable electronics to address key challenges in bioelectronic medicine. By enabling shape actuation, these technologies improve deployment, adaptability, and accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. The review discusses actuation mechanisms, device designs, and future opportunities for intelligent, responsive implants with enhanced therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities.








Abstract
Bioelectronic medicine uses implantable electronic devices to interface with electrically active tissues and transform the way disease is diagnosed and treated. One of the biggest challenges is the development of minimally invasive devices that can be deployed to patients at scale. Responsive materials and soft robotic actuators offer unique opportunities to make bioelectronic devices with shape actuation, promising to address the limitations of existing rigid and passive systems, including difficult deployment, mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, and limited adaptability in minimally invasive settings. In this review, an overview is provided of smart materials and soft robotic technologies that show promises for implantable use, discussing advantages and limitations of underlying actuation mechanisms. Examples are then presented where soft actuating mechanisms are combined with microelectrodes to create shape actuating bioelectronic devices. Opportunities and challenges for next&#8208;generation intelligent bioelectronic devices assisted by responsive materials and soft robotic actuators are then discussed. These innovations may allow electronic implants to safely navigate to target areas inside the body and establish large area and spatiotemporally controlled interfaces for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are minimally invasive.

         <title>Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and nanoscale, and mitigation strategies by controlling the catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface. Moreover, the challenges and prospects of efficient SACs for long&#8208;term use are proposed. This review can provide a unique perspective as well as rational guidelines, with emphasis on stability/durability issues, for future large&#8208;scale applications of SACs and beyond.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine&#8208;tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208; and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal&#8208;support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

         <dc:description>
A contemporary and critical review on carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics. The common thermoplastic and carbon fiber applied in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics are summarized, and the processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. The typical applications of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics in industry are also highlighted.








Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTs) have witnessed a resurgence in recent times since their first industrial use over five decades ago, with revitalized interest from aerospace companies and other key sectors including energy and automotive sectors. CFRTs are increasingly gaining footholds in high volume rapid manufacturing in aerospace and nonaerospace sectors owing to their inherent recyclability. However, there has been a lack of contemporary and critical review on this topic so far. This work aims to review the recent advances in CFRTs with emphasis on high performance thermoplastics. Both continuous and discontinuous fiber forms in tape, organosheet and short/long fiber architectures are discussed, their processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. Typical applications of CFRTs in industry are examined, including fuselage, pressure vessel, and automotive components. Finally, insights are provided into ongoing challenges, future development, and a roadmap for expediting the development of high&#8208;performance CFRTs.

         <title>Materials Advances in Devices for Heart Disease Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the crucial role of materials in heart disease interventions, focusing on strategies for monitoring, managing, and repairing heart conditions. It discusses the material requirements for medical devices, highlighting recent innovations and their impact on cardiovascular health. It aims to provide insights into the challenges in cardiovascular interventions and the essential role of materials in developing effective solutions.








Abstract
Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, and conditions that affect the heart muscle. Intervention strategies can be categorized according to when they are administered and include: 1) Monitoring cardiac function using sensor technology to inform diagnosis and treatment, 2) Managing symptoms by restoring cardiac output, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics, and often serving as bridge&#8208;to&#8208;recovery or bridge&#8208;to&#8208;transplantation strategies, and 3) Repairing damaged tissue, including myocardium and heart valves, when management strategies are insufficient. Each intervention approach and technology require specific material properties to function optimally, relying on materials that support their action and interface with the body, with new technologies increasingly depending on advances in materials science and engineering. This review explores material properties and requirements driving innovation in advanced intervention strategies for heart disease and highlights key examples of recent progress in the field driven by advances in materials research.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Retaining/Ion&#8208;Regulating Bi&#8208;Layers for Highly Durable, All&#8208;Climate, Efficient Moisture Electric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>Wearable Photonic Device for Multiple Biomarker Sampling and Detection without Blood Draws</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable photonic device (PiED) is developed by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and multiple blood biomarker detection without blood draw. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595 nm into skin, evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis and inducing biomarker extravasation.








Abstract
Needle&#8208;based blood draws or phlebotomy practice in clinics for centuries, often causing pain, discomfort, and inconvenience. Here, a wearable photonic device is presented by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and detection. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595&#160;nm into skin through the OMNA, bypassing the light&#8208;absorbing melanin in the epidermal layer, and evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis independent of the skin colors. The 595&#160;nm light is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen&#8208;Hb within the capillaries, triggering thermal dilation of capillaries without damaging them or causing petechiae. The light illumination remarkably increases in the concentrations of various blood biomarkers in the skin through biomarker extravasation. These biomarkers bound specifically to the capture antibodies on&#160;OMNA with each microneedle covalently immobilized with one specific antibody. The OMNA is extensively modified to amplify the immunobinding signals and achieve sensitivity superior to that of enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. As proof of concept, the functionality of the prototype for minimally invasive sampling and precise multiplexed blood biomarker detection in two mouse models is validated to quantify acute inflammation and specific antibody production.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

         <title>Friction Behavior and Microscopic Mechanism of Hydrogels in an Open&#8208;Air Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open&#8208;air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.









Abstract
Hydrogels composed of a solvent&#8208;saturated, cross&#8208;linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open&#8208;air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication. The findings elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the friction behaviors of hydrogels and provide guidelines for designing hydrogel systems with sustained exceptional lubrication properties in open&#8208;air applications.

         <title>Radical p&#8208;Doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient, Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing nitroxide redical, DT&#8208;TEMPO, has been used to address slow oxidation and mechanical stability limitations of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, achieving good power conversion efficiency of 25.69% (rigid, certified 25.30%), 21.23% (rigid mini&#8208;module), and 24.19% (flexible). Most impressively, the flexible devices with DT&#8208;TEMPO show remarkable machnical stability, maintaining &#8764;95% of initial efficiency after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles through a dynamic disulfide bond cleavage and reformation mechanism.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is the primary hole transport material (HTM) for high&#8208;efficiency and stable flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). However, the slow oxidation rate and susceptibility to film cracking under stress in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD lead to reduced device stability and efficiency. In this paper, a multi&#8208;functional novel self&#8208;healing nitroxide radical monomer, 4&#8208;[[5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolane&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;oxopentyl]amino]&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (DT&#8208;TEMPO), has been introduced to address these challenges. DT&#8208;TEMPO, on one side, enhances the hole mobility and conductivity by p&#8208;doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, while boosting the charge transfer process from perovskite to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD with an optimized energy level alignment on the other side. Additionally, DT&#8208;TEMPO endows a self&#8208;healing capability to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through the introduction of dynamic breaking and reconstructing disulfide bond. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies, 25.69% on rigid substrates (certified 25.30%), 21.23% on rigid mini&#8208;modules, and 24.19% on flexible substrates. Remarkably, the FPSCs with DT&#8208;TEMPO retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles (r = 6&#160;mm) and recover to &#8776;95% of their initial value through the self&#8208;healing process.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Color Tunability from a Single Electrochromic Device through In Situ Reconstruction of Optical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate electrochromic devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single electrochromic device that almost spans the entire visible region.








Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) displays, as non&#8208;emissive (passive) displays with low energy consumption, have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Nevertheless, traditional EC technology faces challenges in achieving full&#8208;color displays within a single device due to its limited color gamut, even though full&#8208;color capability is highly desirable for eliminating the need for complex RGB subpixel mosaics. Herein, a new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate EC devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single EC device that almost spans the entire visible region (&#916;hue approaches 360&#176;). Apart from the super&#8208;wide color tunability, the devices also have small working voltage window (0.2&#8208;1.8 V), outstanding bistability (&gt;8&#160;h), extremely low power consumption (&#8776;2.3 mW cm&#8722;2) and good cycling ability (&#8776;4.3% decay rate after 1,000 cycles). Moreover, the super&#8208;wide color tunability of these EC devices has been demonstrated in diverse applications, including shifting rainbow flower images, color palettes, and information displays.

         <title>Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>

Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing (HyFAM) integrates formative processes into additive manufacturing. HyFAM 3D&#8208;prints exterior walls and complex geometries, then formatively fills interior material. By tuning rheological properties, the study can achieve both 3D&#8208;printable ink and self&#8208;leveling, moldable ink of the same material. HyFAM speeds up part production and eliminates internal defects by replacing interior 3D&#8208;printed sections with bulk&#8208;filled material.








Abstract
Material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) provides extensive design flexibility and exceptional material versatility, enabling the fabrication of complex, multifunctional objects ranging from embedded electronics to soft robotics and vascularized tissues. The bottom&#8208;up creation of these objects typically requires discretization into layers and voxels. However, the voxel size, determined by the nozzle diameter, limits extrusion rate, creating a conflict between resolution and speed. To address these inherent scalability challenges, the study proposes a hybrid formative&#8208;additive manufacturing technology that combines the respective strengths of each method&#8212;speed and quality with complexity and flexibility. The approach involves 3D&#8208;printing complex geometries, multimaterial features, and bounding walls of bulky, lower&#8208;resolution volumes, which are rapidly filled via casting or molding. By precisely controlling the materials&#8217; rheological properties&#8212;while maintaining similar solidified properties and high interfacial strength&#8212;several typical AM flaws, such as bulging and internal voids, are eliminated, achieving exponentially faster production speeds for objects with varying feature sizes.

Amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybridis developed through a rapid alternating current electrodeposition method under ambient conditions. The unique architecture integrates the advantages of amorphous and crystalline phases, resulting in exceptional electrochemical performance, including a remarkable specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, and 100% Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

         <title>A Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron Based on a MoWS2/VOx Heterojunction for Vision and Respiratory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS&#8322;/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 10&#8312; with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2&#160;V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable non&#8208;contact respiratory sensing and vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Advancements in computing have progressed from near&#8208;sensor to in&#8208;sensor computing, culminating in the development of multimodal in&#8208;memory computing, which enables faster, energy&#8208;efficient data processing by performing computations directly within the memory devices. A bio&#8208;inspired multimodal in&#8208;memory computing system capable of performing real&#8208;time low power processing of multisensory signals, lowering data conversion and transmission across several modules in conventional chips is introduced. A novel Cu/MoWS2/VOx/Pt based multimodal memristor is characterized by an ON/OFF ratio as high as 108 with consistent and ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 surpassing conventional single&#8208;mode memory functions. Apart from observing electrical synaptic behavior, photonic depression and humidity mediated optical synaptic learning is also demonstrated. The heterojunction with MoWS2 also enables reconfigurable modulation in both memory and optical synaptic functionalities with changing humidity. This behavior provides tunable conductance modulation capabilities emulating synaptic transmission in biological neurons while showing potential in respiratory detection module for healthcare application. The humidity sensing capability is implemented to demonstrate vision clarity using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with different humidity levels applied as a data augmentation preprocessing method. This proposed multimodal functionality represents a novel platform for developing artificial sensory neurons, with significant implications for non&#8208;contact human&#8211;computer interaction in intelligent systems.

         <title>Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors found that the overwhelming apoptotic cells after myocardial infarction (MI) result in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. To address this challenge, an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) is developed to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability.








Abstract
Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR&#8208;M&#934;) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in&#8208;house customized macrophages&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis&#8208;boosted fibrosis&#8208;specific CAR&#8208;M&#934;s by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti&#8208;fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR&#8208;M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR&#8208;M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Like Polymers Targeting Keap1/Nrf2 as Therapeutics for Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a Keap1 targeting protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) which activates Nrf2, an important&#160;cytoprotective transcription factor for&#160;relieving myocardial infarction&#8208;induced oxidative stress. This PLP increases cell survival in vitro in multiple relevant cardiac cell types and elicits pro&#8208;reparative responses, improving cardiac function in a preclinical model. Keap1 inhibiting PLPs&#160;show translational potential for ischemia reperfusion injury.









Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) results in oxidative stress to the myocardium and frequently leads to heart failure (HF). There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutics that address the inflammatory stress response and prevent negative left ventricular remodeling. Here, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein&#8211;protein interaction is specifically targeted, as Nrf2 activation is known to mitigate the inflammatory response following MI. This is achieved using a Nrf2&#8208;mimetic protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) to inhibit the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction. The PLP platform technology provides stability in vivo, potent intracellular bioactivity, and multivalency leading to high avidity Keap1 binding. In vitro and in vivo assays to probe cellular activity and MI therapeutic utility are employed. These Keap1&#8208;inhibiting PLPs (Keap1i&#8208;PLPs) impart cytoprotection from oxidative stress via Nrf2 activation at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations in primary cardiomyocytes. Single&#8208;digit mg kg&#8722;1, single&#8208;dose, intravenous PLP administration significantly improves cardiac function in rats post&#8208;MI through immunomodulatory, anti&#8208;apoptotic, and angiogenic mechanisms. Thus Keap1i&#8208;PLPs disrupt key intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions following intravenous, systemic administration in vivo. These results have broad implications not only for MI but also for other oxidative stress&#8208;driven diseases and conditions.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Observation of Conductive Interstitial Ga Line Defects in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using near&#8208;field infrared and atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron imaging, a novel phenomenon is observed: the presence of conductive interstitial Ga line defects within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes. These defects lead to an associated increase in conductivity, which in turn results in a broadband infrared response and the quenching of cathodoluminescence. Functioning as an antenna, these defects can excite phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride cladding layers, offering exciting prospects for applications in nanophotonic devices.








Abstract
Beta&#8208;phase gallium sesquioxide (&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3), possessing an ultrawide bandgap and high breakdown voltage, exhibits strong potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetection and high&#8208;power electronics. However, nanometer&#8208;scale line defects, prevalent in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 growth, degrade device performance by increasing leakage currents and reducing breakdown voltages, thus termed &#8220;killer defects&#8221;. Critically, the impact of these defects at the atomic scale remains unclear due to limited characterization and a lack of detailed understanding. Here, the observation of novel conductive atomic line defects is reported within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes using near&#8208;field infrared imaging. Combining atomic&#8208;resolution imaging with density functional theory calculations, these defects are identified as interstitial Ga atoms migrating along the c&#8208;axis. These atomic line defects exhibit a broadband infrared response and quenched cathodoluminescence, indicative of significantly enhanced local conductivity. This elevated conductivity enables subsurface near&#8208;field detection of the defects and remote excitation of phonon polaritons in a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. These findings underscore the distinct conductivity of atomic&#8208;scale line defects, emphasizing the need for their controlled management during material synthesis and device fabrication, while simultaneously suggesting opportunities for their exploitation in nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Inhomogeneity and Epitaxial Strain Control Metallicity in Single Crystalline Thin Films of High Entropy Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high&#8208;entropy regime.








Abstract
Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high-entropy regime.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high-entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications. However, very little is known about the metallic phase of HEOs even in bulk form. This work delves into the interplay between global and local structural distortion and electronic properties of single crystalline thin films of (La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Nd&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sm&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)NiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibit metal-insulator transition under tensile strain. Employing electron microscopy and elemental resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneities at the rare-earth site, leading to a broad distribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles. However, the octahedral rotation pattern remains the same throughout. The metallic phase consists of insulating patches with more distorted Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles, responsible for higher resistance exponents with increased compositional complexity.

         <title>Hybrid Lipoplex Boosts Neuron&#8208;Microglia Crosstalk for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease through A&#946;&#8208;Targeted&#8208;Autophagy and ApoE2 Gene Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>

A hybrid lipoplex (RMC/pApoE2) composed of guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS), oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2), and pApoE2 restores neuron&#8208;microglia crosstalk to eliminate A&#946; deposits from temporal and spatial multidimensions. It induces neuronal and microglial autophagy at the upstream and downstream of A&#946; metabolism, along with enhanced pApoE2 transfection for intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular elimination of A&#946; aggregates.








Abstract
Efficient clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co&#8208;assembled with oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro&#8208;autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons&#8208;microglia crosstalk for A&#946; elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine&#8208;rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A&#946; into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A&#946;. The lipoplex&#8208;boosted neuron&#8211;microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular A&#946; aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates &#8776;86.9% of A&#946; plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A&#946; clearance in AD treatment.

         <title>Phosphatidylcholine Liposome Accelerated Platinum Nanomachines (PLANEs) With Enhanced Penetration Capability for Thrombus Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome coating strategy for nanomotors. The isotropic and lubricating PC liposome enhances the linear motion and reduces friction of platinum nanomotors, improving their performance in complex physiological environments. Besides enabling non&#8208;pharmacological thrombolysis, this approach can refine nanomotor delivery systems and boost drug therapy effectiveness.








Abstract
Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus&#8208;targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy. This work presents a novel surface modification strategy for optimizing the motion behavior of platinum nanomotors, offering a promising non&#8208;pharmaceutic approach for thrombotic disease treatment.

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

         <title>Rational Ligand Design of Conjugated Coordination Polymers for Efficient and Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated coordination polymer (CoN4&#8208;pyrr) of single&#8208;atom cobalt coordinated with the nitrogen atom of pyrrole ligand can work as an electrocatalyst for efficient and selective nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3), where a fast transfer of hydrogen (*H) radicals is induced to accelerate the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate on the cobalt active site of CoN4&#8208;pyrr at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers an attractive route for converting nitrate pollutants to ammonia under mild conditions. Among other catalysts, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal&#8208;atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and low&#8208;coordinated metal sites hold immense potential to be extensively applied, which unfortunately encounter a formidable challenge to obtain simultaneous improvement of NRA activity and selectivity. Here, a novel and general strategy is reported to achieve efficient and selective NRA catalysis on conjugated coordination polymers featuring with high&#8208;density and well&#8208;defined nitrogen (N)&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom metal sites via precise regulation of N&#8209;heterocyclic ligands toward accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics necessitated in the NRA pathway. Taking cobalt (Co) as an example, two CoN4&#8208;centered conjugated coordination polymer electrocatalysts (CoN4&#8208;pyrr and CoN4&#8208;pyri) are synthesized with pyrrole and pyridine ligands are investigated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. As revealed, the CoN4&#8208;pyrr can markedly outperform the CoN4&#8208;pyri toward NRA electrocatalysis. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that, relative to the N atoms of pyridine ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyri, the N atoms of pyrrole ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyrr can enable a faster transfer of hydrogen radicals to the Co active sites for accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate at the rate&#8208;determining step of NRA pathway.

     alt="Rational Ligand Design of Conjugated Coordination Polymers for Efficient and Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conjugated coordination polymer (CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyrr) of single-atom cobalt coordinated with the nitrogen atom of pyrrole ligand can work as an electrocatalyst for efficient and selective nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), where a fast transfer of hydrogen (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;H) radicals is induced to accelerate the hydrogenation kinetics of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO intermediate on the cobalt active site of CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyrr at the rate-determining step.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers an attractive route for converting nitrate pollutants to ammonia under mild conditions. Among other catalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal-atom-utilization efficiency and low-coordinated metal sites hold immense potential to be extensively applied, which unfortunately encounter a formidable challenge to obtain simultaneous improvement of NRA activity and selectivity. Here, a novel and general strategy is reported to achieve efficient and selective NRA catalysis on conjugated coordination polymers featuring with high-density and well-defined nitrogen (N)-coordinated single-atom metal sites via precise regulation of N&#8209;heterocyclic ligands toward accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics necessitated in the NRA pathway. Taking cobalt (Co) as an example, two CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-centered conjugated coordination polymer electrocatalysts (CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyrr and CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyri) are synthesized with pyrrole and pyridine ligands are investigated as a proof-of-concept study. As revealed, the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyrr can markedly outperform the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyri toward NRA electrocatalysis. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that, relative to the N atoms of pyridine ligand in CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyri, the N atoms of pyrrole ligand in CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyrr can enable a faster transfer of hydrogen radicals to the Co active sites for accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO intermediate at the rate-determining step of NRA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Tunable Time&#8208;Dependent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color tunable time&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is achieved via a self&#8208;doping strategy for simultaneous modulation of their carbon core N&#8208;related and surface oxygen&#8208;related emissive centers. The broad emission color, long lifetime, and excellent luminescence stability of these dynamic afterglow materials promote their practical applications in multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption, as well as time&#8208;delay light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).








Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color time&#8208;dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full&#8208;color TDTP has been realized in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self&#8208;doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state and the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow&#8208;decaying blue afterglow (453&#160;nm) and the fast&#8208;decaying green to red afterglow (513&#8211;609&#160;nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red&#8208;shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C&#9552;O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix&#8208;free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365&#160;nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, as well as time&#8208;delayed light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Upcycling Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Constructing Bifunctional Catalysts Featuring Long&#8208;Range Order and Short&#8208;Range Disorder for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, an interesting strategy is proposed for upcycling Ni, Co, and Mn valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into a bifunctional catalyst for lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries by a rapid Joule&#8208;heated thermal shock method. This is a well&#8208;defined catalyst combining both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. Benefiting from the unique atomic arrangement, the long&#8208;range order L12 structure significantly enhances the long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst, while the short&#8208;range disorder character of the M site triggers the cocktail effect and further activates the Pt catalytic kinetics. Experiments and theoretical results disclose that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. This distinctly lowers both the energy barriers of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Upcycling of high&#8208;value metals (M = Ni, Co, Mn) from spent ternary lithium&#8208;ion batteries to the field of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries is highly appealing, yet remains a huge challenge. In particular, the alloying of the recovered M components with Pt and applied as cathode catalysts have not yet been reported. Herein, a fresh L12&#8208;type Pt3&#160;M medium&#8208;entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yMnxCoyO2 cathode. This well&#8208;defined catalyst combines both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. Specifically, the L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The work provides important insights for the recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into advanced catalyst&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Superhigh Magnetostriction in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Grown Fe&#8208;Ga Single&#8208;Crystals by Rapid&#8208;Directional&#8208;Solidification</title>

An innovative strategy of rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification is developed to unexpectedly grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals of Fe&#8208;Ga magnetostrictive material with the supersaturation of Tb, leading to an unprecedentedly giant magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals. This study paves the way for realizing revolutionary material performance by innovating the concept and fabrication method of non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals.








Abstract
The non&#8208;equilibrium microstructure characterized by Tb supersaturation within Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals is deduced to induce a substantial enhancement in magnetostriction. However, the growth of the non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal remains a formidable obstacle, as existing methods can only produce either non&#8208;equilibrium polycrystal or near&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal, leading to the stagnation in magnetostriction. Herein, a rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification (RDS) strategy is devised to grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals. The RDS is realized through achieving an ultrahigh temperature gradient of &#8776;106 K&#160;m&#8722;1 at S&#8208;L interface front, accompanied by an ultrafast growth velocity. This results in single&#8208;crystal growth under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions with a giant cooling rate of 102&#8211;103 K&#160;s&#8722;1, which is &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude greater than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of directional&#8208;solidification methods. A non&#8208;equilibrium Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystal, featured with traces of Tb supersaturation, is successfully grown with a significantly enhanced magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm. This magnitude of magnetostriction sets a record in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga materials, surpassing the maximum value reported for Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals by 60%. The advent of RDS strategy opens an avenue for fabricating non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals with revolutionary performance, and paves the way for fabricating currently unattainable single&#8208;crystals for engineering applications.

         <title>Hybrid Additive Manufacturing of Shear&#8208;Stiffening Elastomer Composites for Enhanced Mechanical Properties and Intelligent Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve anisotropic structural design of shear stiffening materials, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy is proposed to create a lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composite (TPR&#8208;SSE composite) with enhanced mechanical properties. Based on this, an intelligent sports shoe is developed, demonstrating the potential application of the TPR&#8208;SSE composite material in wearable smart protective equipment.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;stiffening materials, renowned for their rate&#8208;dependent behavior, hold immense potential for impact&#8208;resistant applications but are often constrained by limited load&#8208;bearing capacity under extreme conditions. In this study, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy that successfully achieves anisotropic structural design of shear&#8208;stiffening materials is proposed. In this strategy, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is synergistically combined with direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composites (TPR&#8208;SSE composites) with enhanced mechanical properties. Through quasistatic characterization and dynamic impact experiments, complemented by noncontact optical measurement and finite element simulation, the mechanical enhancement mechanisms imparted by the lattice architecture are systematically uncovered. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional load&#8208;bearing capacity under quasistatic conditions and superior energy dissipation under dynamic impacts, making them ideal for advanced protective systems. Building on this, smart sports shoes featuring a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based smart sensing module that integrates structural customizability, buffering capacity, and gait recognition, are developed. This work provides a transformative structure design approach to shear&#8208;stiffening materials systems, paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable protection applications.

         <title>Enabling High Reversibility of Both Cationic and Anionic Redox in Layered Oxide Cathodes via NiMn6 Superlattice Topology for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material (NNLMO) with the LiMn6 and NiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is constructed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, realizing the reversible cationic and anionic redox. The Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the redox activity, while the NiMn6 topology provides topological protection to reinforce the superstructure stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox provides a transformative opportunity to achieve high energy density of batteries. However, it is challenging to guarantee the reversibility of both cationic and anionic redox for layered transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials due to the high oxygen&#8208;redox reactivity and the complex structural rearrangements. Herein, a honeycomb&#8208;layered Na0.78Ni0.12Li0.18Mn0.7O2 (NNLMO) cathode material with the NiMn6 and LiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the cationic and anionic redox activity by enlarging the energy gap between O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals, while the NiMn6 topology renders the LiMn6 topology delocalized in the TM layers to reinforce the superstructure stability through suppressing the intralayer Mn migration and O2 formation. As a result, NNLMO delivers a highly reversible capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 with the mitigated voltage hysteresis and exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 92.2% over 50 cycles within the wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V. The findings suggest a new insight into the topological superstructure design of high&#8208;energy oxide cathode materials for sustainable batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Integrated Micro&#8208;Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb&#8208;Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellular cell micro&#8208;vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb&#8208;like structured nano&#8208;networks is created by a unique electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly technique. Due to the micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano&#8208;scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;resistance PM0.3 removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade&#8208;off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high&#8208;performance integrated micro&#8208;vortex filter is created using honeycomb&#8208;like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self&#8208;assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one&#8208;step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large&#8208;scale. The resultant micro&#8208;vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &gt;99.97% PM0.3 removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&#8722;2 dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.

         <title>Relaxor Antiferroelectric Dynamics for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel 2D relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) material CuBiP2Se6 (CBPS)&#160;showcases unique AFE and optoelectronic properties. These properties enable CBPS devices to mimic synaptic plasticity through reversible polarization switching under electrical stimuli. Moreover, they can replicate key characteristics of biological synapses in response to optical stimuli, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor computing applications such as image restoration.








Abstract
Relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) materials display a gradual polarization response and high energy storage density with polarization slowly reverting after removing an external field. This distinctive polarization&#8208;switching behavior closely resembles synaptic plasticity in biological nervous systems, presenting substantial potential for neuromorphic computing applications. Especially, its 2D scenario exhibits unique physical properties and maintains stability at atomic thickness due to their antipolar alignment, which effectively eliminates the depolarization field effect. Such stable 2D relaxor AFE materials offer significant advantages for integrating these materials into modern electronic devices for neuromorphic computing. In this study, the potential of a novel quaternary layered AFE material, CuBiP&#8322;Se&#8326; (CBPS), is explored for neuromorphic device applications. CBPS exhibits a broad range of light absorption and stable relaxor AFE behavior, rendering it an outstanding candidate for optoelectronic synaptic devices. High&#8208;quality CBPS is synthesized and its AFE properties through various characterization techniques are verified. CBPS&#8208;based synaptic devices demonstrate dual&#8208;mode tunable resistance plasticity stimulated by both electrical and optical inputs, demonstrating the capacity to perform in&#8208;sensor computing for image restoration tasks. These findings suggest that relaxor AFE materials like CBPS could provide a robust platform for various brain&#8208;inspired applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Neuromorphic Transistors Integrating Photo&#8208;Sensor, Optical Memory and Visual Synapses for Artificial Vision Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic transistor integrating sensing, memory, and computing in one device to address the challenges of commercial artificial vision system. By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo&#8208;sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1), a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level optical memory (&gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.








Abstract
In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate&#8208;tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the device achieves the multi&#8208;mode integration of photo&#8208;sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (VTG), a strong photo&#8208;gating effect enables highly sensitive photo&#8208;response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 1014 Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level (&gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 106. At zero or positive VTG, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi&#8208;mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration and manufacturing complexity.

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Perovskite Composite Air Electrode With Thermal&#8208;Expansion Offset and Mechanical Support Functions for Highly Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell perovskite composite with a highly durable electrochemical activity for oxygen catalysis is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) via a unique solid&#8208;state reaction. This work also demonstrates a new pathway to developing highly durable air electrode materials for RPCCs technology, accelerating RPCCs&#8217; commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) offer a promising pathway to efficient and reversible energy conversion, accelerating the global shift to renewables. However, the RPCCs&#8217; commercialization faces limitations in air electrode materials. Traditional cobalt&#8208;based perovskite air electrodes, while effective, suffer from high cost and environmental concerns. Alternative materials, such as SrFeO3&#8208;&#948; (SF)&#8208;based perovskites, offer potential, yet durability issues, including thermal&#8208;expansion mismatch and mechanical instability, hinder their practical application. Here, a unique solid&#8208;state reaction between SF and negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) material is demonstrated to yield a core&#8208;shell perovskite composite as a highly durable RPCCs air electrode. Specifically, by calcining a mixture of SF and an NTE material, ZrW2O8 (ZWO), the in situ incorporation of ZWO into the SF lattice is achieved, resulting in a non&#8208;closed core&#8208;shell composite, comprising single perovskite SraFebZrcWdO3&#8208;&#948; (SP&#8208;SFZW) core and B&#8208;site cation ordered double perovskite SrxFeyZrmWnO6&#8208;&#948; (DP&#8208;SFZW) shell. Both SP&#8208;SFZW and DP&#8208;SFZW serve as oxygen catalysts, while DP&#8208;SFZW shell additionally acts as a thermal expansion suppressor and mechanical support structure, effectively mitigating electrode cracking and delamination from other cell components during RPCC operation. Consequently, the composite electrode demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to SF, coupled with significantly enhanced durability. This work illustrates a novel approach for developing robust RPCCs air electrode.

         <title>Toward Switching and Fusing Neuromorphic Computing: Vertical Bulk Heterojunction Transistors with Multi&#8208;Neuromorphic Functions for Efficient Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zou et al propose a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor, integrating three functions of the synapse, artificial spiking neuron, and artificial self&#8208;activation neuron for the first time. By simply changing the program, it can switch between spiking neurons and self&#8208;activating neurons, which effectively facilitates seamless switching and fusion computation of artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) holds great promise for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the reported ANN and SNN computational architectures are independent and require a large number of auxiliary circuits and external algorithms for fusion training. Here, a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor (VHNT) capable of emulating both ANN and SNN computational functions is presented. TaOx&#8208;based electrochemical reactions and PDVT&#8208;10/N2200&#8208;based bulk heterojunctions are used to realize spike coding and voltage coding, respectively. Notably, the device exhibits remarkable efficiency, consuming a mere 0.84 nJ of energy consumption for a single multiply accumulate (MAC) operation with excellent linearity. Moreover, the device can be switched to spiking neuron and self&#8208;activation neuron by simply changing the programming without auxiliary circuits. Finally, the VHNT&#8208;based artificial spiking neural network (ASNN) fusion simulation architecture is demonstrated, achieving 95% accuracy for Canadian&#8208;Institute&#8208;For&#8208;Advanced&#8208;ResearchResearch&#8208;10 (CIFARResearch&#8208;10) dataset while significantly enhancing training speed and efficiency. This work proposes a novel device strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and environmentally adaptive AGI.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics With Simultaneously High Piezoelectricity and High Mechanical Quality Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are critical for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between d33 and Qm. This work reports a novel strategy involving the introduction of defect dipoles into quadruple point compositions to break the conventional trade&#8208;off and simultaneously enhance d33 to 710 pC/N and Qm to 929 in designed lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are vital for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging, particularly for lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, because a high d33 value relies on mobile domain walls, which increase dissipative losses and reduce Qm. In this study, this longstanding trade&#8208;off is overcome by introducing defect dipoles (via Mn doping) into the quadruple point (QP) composition of the lead&#8208;free Ba(Sn, Ti)O3 system. The resultant 0.5%Mn&#8208;doped Ba(Sn0.11Ti0.89)O3 (BST&#8208;0.5%Mn) ceramic exhibits a high d33 value of 710 pC/N and high Qm value of 929, while the BST&#8208;1%Mn ceramic achieves a d33 value of 614 pC/N and Qm value of 1138. These values represent a 10&#8208;fold increase in Qm and 1.6&#8208;fold increase in d33 for BST&#8208;0.5%Mn, compared to those for undoped BST. High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the enhanced d33 and Qm are attributable to the coexistence of multiple phases of QPs with symmetry&#8208;conforming defect dipoles, challenging the long&#8208;held notion of physical incompatibility between high d33 and high Qm. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco&#8208;friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high&#8208;power applications.

&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco-friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high-power applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structured Light Projection Using Image Guide Fibers for In Situ Photo&#8208;biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based biofabrication is typically performed with single wavelength light sources and within benchtop devices. This work demonstrates FaSt&#8208;Light (Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light) as a new approach to achieve multiwavelength image projection using flexible image guide fibers, which enables a variety of applications for in situ biofabrication.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light (FaSt&#8208;Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image&#8208;guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt&#8208;Light allows control over the cross&#8208;section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.

         <title>Deep Learning Empowered Parallelized Metasurface Computed Tomography Snapshot Spectral Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshot spectral imaging faces challenges in miniaturization due to cascading optics. Here, an ultracompact parallelized metasurface tomography spectral imaging system synergized with generative deep learning is presented. Parallel sub&#8208;metasurfaces capture multi&#8208;angle spectral projections, while a trained adversarial network reconstructs spectral images with high resolution in milliseconds. This sub&#8208;mm3&#8208;scale innovation enables endoscopic/microscopic integration, promising to transform real&#8208;time biomedical diagnostics.









Abstract
Snapshot spectral imaging is an emerging technology for fast data acquisition in dynamic environments, capturing high&#8208;volume spatial&#8208;spectral information in a single snapshot. However, it suffers from bulky cascading optics and cannot be directly used in space&#8208;restricted scenarios such as endoscope&#8208;assisted brain microsurgery and real&#8208;time cellular tissue imaging. In this work, an ultracompact strategy of parallelized metasurface computed tomography empowered by generative deep learning is proposed, which can effectively reduce the optics volume in snapshot spectral imaging from cm3 scale to sub&#8208;mm3 scale while retaining high resolution and speed of imaging so that the above&#8208;mentioned pain point problem is well addressed. The system comprises seven multifunctional sub&#8208;metasurfaces simultaneously acquiring multi&#8208;angle spectral projection and integration information of the target, uses the system&#8208;calibrated point spread functions as wavelength and spatial position distributions, and incorporates a generative adversarial deep neural network for fast reconstruction of spatial&#8208;spectral multiplexed images. Experimental results show that single snapshot imaging can be achieved in 38&#160;ms with a spectral resolution of 10&#160;nm in the spectral range of 450&#8211;650&#160;nm. This technique paves the way for snapshot spectral imaging integration into various highly miniaturized microscopy and endoscopic imaging systems in applications such as advanced medical diagnosis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Thermal Charging Cells Enabled by Ca&#8211;Li Dual&#8208;Cationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes and Anionophilic Separators</title>

         <dc:description>
Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%. The dual&#8208;cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca2+ and Li+ ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&#8722;1, and an outstanding Carnot&#8208;relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service&#8208;temperature range of i&#8208;TEs, holding significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.

         <title>Strut&#8208;Buckling Transformation Enabling Anomalous Density&#8208;Scaling Toughening Law in Ultralight Lattice Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers an anomalous density&#8208;scaling toughening law in discrete lattices, where ultrahigh&#160;specific fracture toughness can be achieved at ultralow relative density, thereby filling gaps in material property space. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying sizes, topologies, and component properties.








Abstract
Lightweight lattice metamaterials attract considerable attention due to their exceptional and tunable mechanical properties. However, their practical application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to inevitable&#160;manufacturing defects. Traditional fracture mechanics of lattice metamaterials are confined to localized tensile failure of a crack&#8208;tip strut, overlooking the toughening effect of buckling instability in discrete struts around the crack front. Here, via a combination of additive manufacturing, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis, this work identifies an anomalous power scaling law of specific fracture energy with relative density, where the scaling exponent shifts to negative values below a critical relative density. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying length scales, crack orientations, node connectivity, and component properties. By strategically harnessing strut buckling mechanisms, exceptionally high specific fracture toughness can be achieved at extremely low relative density, thereby addressing gaps in the material property design space. These findings not only provide physical insights into discrete lattice fracture but also offer design motifs for ultralight, ultra&#8208;tough lattice metamaterials.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Emission and Weak Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in 2D Layered Germanium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and photophysical properties of the 2D layered metal halides (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 are reported. For the Ge composition, reduced exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is found and the absence of bound&#8208;exciton emission, present for the Pb composition. The narrowest reported emission linewidth from a Ge&#8208;based 2D metal halide is measured, to date, suggesting that Ge&#8208;based materials offer a promising, less&#8208;toxic alternative for light&#8208;emitting applications.








Abstract
The photophysical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide semiconductors and their tunability make them promising candidates for light&#8208;absorbing and emitting applications. Yet, the germanium&#8208;based halide perovskites to date lack desirable light&#8208;emitting properties, with so far only very broad, weak, and unstructured photoluminescence (PL) reported due to significant octahedral distortion. Here, the photophysical properties of the 2D layered Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper semiconductors (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 (4F&#8208;PMA: 4&#8208;F&#8208;phenylmethylammonium) are characterized and compared. Using a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, variable temperature time&#8208;resolved PL, and density functional theory, structure&#8208;property relations are correlated. Specifically, the results indicate that (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 features stronger coupling to longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, assisting emission from a broad bound&#8208;exciton state due to a soft, deformable lattice. In contrast, (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4, benefitting from intermolecular bonding to scaffold a rigid octahedral structure, shows weaker LO&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in the longest PL lifetime and most narrow linewidth (&#8776;120 meV linewidth at 2 K) reported for a Ge&#8208;halide perovskite yet, without the occurrence of any additional bound&#8208;state emission at low temperatures. These results highlight the potential of germanium halide perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhalable Ce Nanozyme&#8208;Backpacked Phage Aims at Ischemic Cerebral Injury by M1&#8208;Microglia Hitchhiking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a bio&#8208;active, inhalable nanozyme&#8208;backpacked M13 phage (CZM) which specifically delivers to the ischemic core via the olfactory bulb pathway. Leveraging M1&#8208;microglia hitchhiking, CZM accumulates specifically at the lesion site, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, providing a safe and effective strategy for the precise treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.








Abstract
There is a desperate need for precise nanomedications to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Yet, the drawbacks of poor delivery efficiency and off&#8208;target toxicity in pathologic parenchyma for traditional antioxidants against ischemic stroke result in inadequate brain accumulation. M13 bacteriophages are highly phagocytosed by M1&#8208;polarized microglia and can be carried toward the neuroinflammatory sites. Here, a bio&#8208;active, inhalable, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2&#8208;backpacked&#8208;M13 phage (abbreviated as CZM) is developed and demonstrates how M13 bacteriophages are taken up by different phenotypes&#8217; microglia. With the M1 microglia's proliferating and migrating, CZM can be extensively and specifically delivered to the site of the ischemic core and penumbra, where the surviving nerve cells need to be shielded from secondary oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). With non&#8208;invasive administration, CZM effectively alleviates oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons by eliminating ROS generated by hyperactive M1&#8208;polarized microglia. Here, a secure and effective strategy for the targeted therapy of neuroinflammatory maladies is offered by this research.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Tethered Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Program Robust and Tumor&#8208;Responsive Enhancement of Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored tumor&#8208;responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.

         <title>An Optimized Aerogel&#8208;Based Apheresis Device for Targeted Lipid Clearance in Elderly Hyperlipidemia Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an aerogel apheresis device specifically designed for hyperlipidemia management in elderly patients. Leveraging the unique properties of aerogels, LipClean achieves selective lipid adsorption from plasma while maintaining efficiency and biocompatibility. The optimized hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic network ensures effective water permeability and reduces the unintended removal of essential plasma components.








Abstract
Elderly patients with hyperlipidemia often exhibit resistance to conventional hypolipidemic treatments, underscoring the need for more effective strategies to address lipid imbalances in this high&#8208;risk group. This study introduces LipClean, an aerogel&#8208;based apheresis device specifically designed to remove harmful plasma lipids. LipClean is constructed using hydrophilic cellulose fibers, which serve as a supramolecular platform for synthesizing hydrophobic conjugated polymers through a Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara reaction. These conjugated polymers are then cross&#8208;linked with the cellulose fibers via phosphorylation, generating an aerogel monolith with an interpenetrating network of hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymers. Unlike bilayer aerogels that separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, LipClean's interpenetrating structure is precisely engineered through polymer design and gradient cross&#8208;linking. This optimization enhances both bodily fluid flow and lipid adsorption while minimizing the removal of essential plasma components and ensuring unobstructed cell passage. In preclinical testing, LipClean significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in an elderly rat model of hyperlipidemia and normalized lipid levels in blood samples from hypertensive patients. Importantly, purified blood maintained normal levels of blood cells and physiological and biochemical indicators after apheresis, highlighting LipClean's potential for managing hyperlipidemia&#8208;related disorders. This study, therefore, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving medical device innovation.

         <title>Inverse Opal Photonic Crystal Structured Bifacial&#8208;Iridescent Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifacial&#8208;iridescent solar cell is developed using an inverse opal perovskite photonic crystal. It exhibited unique iridescent structural colors on both sides and achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency of 18.00% for small cells and 12.77% for mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Colorful perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which increase the utilization of clean power. However, their efficiencies are lower than those of uncolored devices. Moreover, traditional mono&#8208;facial colored devices cannot satisfy diverse BIPV scenarios. Here a bifacial iridescent solar cell (BFI&#8208;SC) is developed,&#160;constructed by inverse opal (IO) perovskite photonic crystals and transparent front and rear electrodes. The developed BFI&#8208;SC exhibited bright vivid colors on both sides, which originate from the reflection at the photonic stop band of the IO perovskite photonic crystal. Moreover, this unique IO photonic crystal decreased the interfacial Fresnel reflection and generated a slow&#8208;photon effect, which increases the material light absorption and utilization to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, the BFI&#8208;SC can harvest light from both sides, considerably enhancing the device efficiency. Thus, the BFI&#8208;SC achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency (&#951;eq) of 18.00%, which is the highest value achieved for the reported multicolored (or iridescent) solar cell. A larger&#8208;scale BFI&#8208;SC module is successfully assembled, achieving a champion &#951;eq of 12.77%. In addition, another perovskite material with an IO structure and wide&#8208;bandgap components exhibited vivid colors on both sides, indicating the universality of this coloring strategy and its independence of the perovskite components.

         <title>Electroadhesion Suction Cups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups are electrically operated soft grippers that can pick up a wide range of objects from the top. A soft membrane, driven by electrostatic forces, conforms to surfaces, creating a passive vacuum when lifted. EA suction cups eliminate bulky vacuum systems, offering a compact, efficient, and portable alternative for industrial and service robotics.








Abstract
Suction cups are the light bulbs of robotics and automation. They are simple, reliable, yet energy&#8208;hungry, and require a bulky and noisy vacuum infrastructure. This work reports Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups: soft, silent, monolithic, electrically&#8208;driven grippers, with a power consumption of only 1.5&#160;W, that can grasp flat and curved objects, with smooth or rough surfaces, holding payloads up to 1.5&#160;kg. This performance is enabled by a deeper understanding of the contact mechanics of electroadhesion systems. A thin and soft membrane containing interdigitated electrodes zips onto the object driven by electrostatic forces, conforming to the object's shape and thus establishing large&#8208;area contact. The lifting force is transmitted to a robot arm through a small pillar connected at the center of the membrane. This design maximizes the peeling force and enables the formation of passive vacuum inside the conical chamber formed when the membrane stretches during lifting. Object release is obtained by turning off the voltage and optionally by opening a valve to quickly break the vacuum. EA suction cups address many shortcomings of widely used vacuum&#8208;driven grippers, offering a compact, fully electric, and energy&#8208;efficient solution that meets the needs for efficiency and portability in both industrial and service robotics.

         <title>Octopus Tentacle&#8208;Inspired In&#8208;Sensor Adaptive Integral for Edge&#8208;Intelligent Touch Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the octopus cerebellum on its tentacles, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent touch sensor is proposed. It epitomizes touch strategic innovation by integrating a geometric progression structure that not only enhances deformability but also embeds an integral in&#8208;sensing mechanism. The work provides ground&#8208;breaking insight into the in&#8208;sensor computing and adaptive structure design strategies for advancing deformable multitouch electronics.








Abstract
Electronics continue to drive technological innovation and diversified applications. To ensure efficiency and effectiveness across various interactive contexts, the ability to adjust operating functions or parameters according to environmental shifts or user requirements is highly desirable. However, due to the inherent limitations of nonadaptive device structures and materials, the current development of touch electronics faces challenges, e.g., limited hardware resources, poor adaptability, weak deformation stability, and bottlenecks in sensing data processing. Here, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent (RAI) touch sensor is proposed, inspired by octopus's tentacle cognitive behavior. It realizes remarkable deformability and highly efficient multitouch interactions. The geometric progression structure of the sensing element equips the RAI touch sensor with a unique integrated&#8208;in&#8208;sensing mechanism and programmable logic. This greatly compresses sensing data dimensionality at the edge, yielding concise and undistorted interactive signals. By leveraging the advantages of hard&#8208;soft bonding and interface modulation of functional materials, the adaptability is achieved with a 200% strain range a 180&#176; twist tolerance, and exceptional deformation stability of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles. The diverse application&#8208;specific configurations of the RAI touch sensor, enable a dynamic intention recognition accuracy of over 99%, advancing next&#8208;generation Internet of Things and edge computing research and innovation.

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure&#8208;shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto&#8208;transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.

         <title>A Simple Optical Convolution Strategy Based on Versatile Adjustable Optical Convolution Kernel for All&#8208;Optical Convolution Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optical convolution strategy leveraging continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as convolution kernel is proposed for all&#8208;optical computing. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD array successfully demonstrates parallel and highly efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. The system achieves convolution computing in a non&#8208;von Neumann architecture, exhibiting structural simplicity, high computational efficiency, and powerful image processing and segmentation capabilities.








Abstract
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is currently one of the most important artificial neural networks. However, traditional CNN hardware architectures suffer from significant increases in energy consumption and processing time as the demand for artificial intelligence tasks grows. Here, a novel optical convolution computing strategy is proposed that leverages a continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as the optical convolution kernel, enabling parallel, all&#8208;optical convolution computing and greatly simplifying the traditional convolution process. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD exhibits visible long&#8208;afterglow emission characteristics due to the charge trapping and retention effects. This allows for continuously adjustable light weights, facilitating arbitrary convolution operations. Building on this, parallel and efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations have been successfully demonstrated using CA&#8208;PLD arrays with different weight combinations. Moreover, space&#8208;transformable CA&#8208;PLD units enable applications in dilated convolution. In a semantic segmentation task with 20 categories, the CA&#8208;PLD units achieve higher Intersection over Union (IoU) values and accuracy. Therefore, the weight&#8208;adjustable and spatial transformable CA&#8208;PLD proposed in this work holds promise for future applications in intelligent optical computing systems and optical implementations of non&#8208;von Neumann architectures.

Building on this, parallel and efficient multiply-accumulate operations have been successfully demonstrated using CA-PLD arrays with different weight combinations. Moreover, space-transformable CA-PLD units enable applications in dilated convolution. In a semantic segmentation task with 20 categories, the CA-PLD units achieve higher Intersection over Union (IoU) values and accuracy. Therefore, the weight-adjustable and spatial transformable CA-PLD proposed in this work holds promise for future applications in intelligent optical computing systems and optical implementations of non-von Neumann architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uniaxiality&#8208;Induced Reduced&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;type sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon, is synthesized at 16 GPa (vs. 30 GPa in previous reports) via uniaxial stress&#8208;induced collapse of C60 at lower pressures. By integrating experimental and computational insights, this work opens avenues for designing novel materials through controlled stress environments under pressure and offers a strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure material production.








Abstract
Synthesizing fully sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp3 bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;form sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face&#8208;centered cubic C60 at 30&#160;GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large&#8208;scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature&#8208;pressure phase diagram of C60. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C60 cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C60 cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced&#8208;pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure materials.

         <title>Pressure Induced Molecular&#8208;Arrangement and Charge&#8208;Density Perturbance in Doped Polymer for Intelligent Motion and Vocal Recognitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sidechain doped polymer is investigated to have great potential for pressure detection due to the advantages including molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbance induced by micro&#8208;mechanical deformation. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template&#8208;full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich&#8208;structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.

         <title>Stable and Ultrasensitive X&#8208;Ray Detectors Based on Oriented Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Rods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC single crystal rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. The oriented FAPbI3 SCR shows high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity. Therefore, the SC detectors realize record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging at a low dose rate of 12 nGy s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals (SCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors. X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated using perovskite FAPbI3 SCs exhibit high detection sensitivity. However, two pressing issues still need to be addressed for practical applications: the orientation&#8208;controlled growth and environmentally friendly acquisition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 SCs. In this study, large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. Owing to the high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity of the oriented FAPbI3 SCRs, the SC detectors realize a record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high sensitivity to dark current density ratio (1.93 &#215; 109&#160;Gy&#8722;1 s). Furthermore, the detectors exhibit both ultralow dark and X&#8208;ray current drifts, as well as a detection limit of 2 nGy s&#8722;1. These characteristics enable the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, even at dose rates as low as 12 nGy s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes a new technical solution for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detection, but also establishes a new approach for the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly production of core materials for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Signal Converter&#8208;Based Therapy Platform Promoting Aging Bone Healing by Improving Permeability of the Mitochondrial Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GelMA microspheres integrated with polydopamine&#8208;coated gold nanorods (GMPG) respond to ultrasound stimulation, converting it into biochemical signals that stimulate senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to highly express HSP70, thereby improving mitochondrial membrane permeability by inhibiting BAX activation, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and ultimately promoting aging bone regeneration.








Abstract
The aging microenvironment promotes persistent inflammation and loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity. These are major obstacles to effective bone tissue repair in older adults. This study aims to explore how physical thermal stimulation can effectively delay the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) aging process. Based on this, an implantable physical signal&#8208;converter platform is designed as a therapeutic system that enables stable heat signals at the bone injury site under ultrasound stimulation (US). It is found that the therapeutic platform controllably reduces the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization of aging BMSCs, bidirectionally inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. The leakage ratio of mtDNA decreases by 22.7%. This effectively mitigates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and its downstream NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling induced by oxidative stress in aging BMSCs, thereby attenuating the pathological advancement of chronic inflammation. Thus, it effectively restores the metabolism and osteogenic differentiation of aging BMSCs in vitro, which is further confirmed in a rat model. In the GMPG/US group, the bone mineral density increases 2&#8211;3 times at 4 weeks in the rats femoral defect model. Therefore, this ultrasound&#8208;based signal&#8208;conversion platform provides a promising strategy for aging bone defect repair.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging.

         <title>In Situ Secondary Self&#8208;Assembly of Near&#8208;Infrared II J&#8208;Aggregates: A Novel Phototheranostic Strategy for Inducing Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared II J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine has been observed to target tumor tissue and achieve effective penetration and prolonged retention in tumor tissue using an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy. These nanomedicines induce tumor pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species (superoxide anions), facilitating robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and activating tumor photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that bypasses apoptosis resistance and triggers tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, has gained much attention as a promising approach to cancer therapy. Despite enhancing tumor accumulation and extending the circulation of small&#8208;molecule drugs, nanomedicines still face significant challenges, including poor tissue penetration, tumor resistance, and hypoxic microenvironments. To overcome these challenges, a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine is designed, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles (MSDP NPs). These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that MSDP NPs achieve efficient tumor penetration and prolong tumor&#160;retention, which is facilitated by the J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;driven formation of microscale spindle&#8208;shaped fibrillar bundles through in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly at the tumor site. This unique structural transformation enhances nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. This study provides an innovative phototheranostic strategy that utilizes the in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to induce tumor pyroptosis, offering a potential solution to the limitations of current nanomedicines in cancer therapy.

         <title>Pushing the Limits: Maximizing Energy Density in Silicon Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy silicon solid&#8208;state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro&#8208;Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathode. Optimized dry/wet processing and interface engineering enable excellent cell cycling stability. Key degradation mechanisms are identified, providing strategies to enhance long&#8208;term performance of solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
For the first time, we demonstrate a silicon solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) architecture that achieves &gt;400 Wh kg&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit for silicon&#8208;based SSBs. This configuration features a 99.9 wt% micro&#8208;Si, a thin sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE), and a high&#8208;loading NMC811. Key to these results is strategically selecting and evaluating the processing techniques, whether wet or dry, for the negative electrode, positive electrode and thin sheet&#8208;type SSE. Excessive lithium incorporation into the silicon host, beyond the Li3.75+Si phase to form a LiSi composite, is essential to match the high capacity of the positive electrode. This SSB achieves over 1000 cycles for a 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 with &#8776;80% capacity retention and 94% capacity retention for 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 500 cycles at 25 &#176;C. Post analysis identifies the primary capacity decay mechanisms as oxidation at the NMC/SSE interface and structural disruptions within NMC. Meanwhile, the Si electrode maintains a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer, minimizing capacity decay. This study highlights the necessity for improved NMC coatings, lattice oxygen stabilization, and a durable positive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to improve the long&#8208;term stability of SSBs. Strategies leading to a single&#8208;layer pouch cell SSB exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 are developed.

         <title>Ultrahigh Conductive MXene Films for Broadband Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of nitrogen&#8208;substituted MXene films, spanning the full composition range, achieves record&#8208;high conductivity (35&#8201;000 S cm&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding across X, Ka, and W bands, even in ultrathin layers. These solution&#8208;processable, lightweight films outperform metals and open new possibilities for high&#8208;frequency electronics and wireless communication systems of the future.








Abstract
Broadband and ultrathin electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials are crucial for efficient high&#8208;frequency data transmission in emerging technologies. MXenes are renowned for their outstanding electrical conductivity and EMI&#8208;shielding capability. While substituting nitrogen (N) for carbon (C) atoms in the conventional MXene structure is theoretically expected to enhance these properties, synthesis challenges have hindered progress. Here, it is demonstrated that TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene films with optimized N content achieve a record&#8208;high electrical conductivity of 35&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1 and exceptional broadband EMI shielding across the X (8&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz), Ka (26.5&#8211;40&#160;GHz), and W (75&#8211;110&#160;GHz) bands&#8212;outperforming all previously reported materials even at reduced thicknesses. By synthesizing a full series of high&#8208;stoichiometric TixAlCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1 MAX phases without intermediate phases, the impact of N substitution on the physical and electrical properties of TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene flakes is systematically explored, achieving complete composition tunability in both dispersion and film forms. These findings position TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXenes as promising candidates for applications spanning from conventional lower&#8208;frequency domains to next&#8208;generation sub&#8208;THz electronics.

         <title>Reconstruction of the Buried Interface of Triple&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (WBG) with potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK), a graded heterojunction is formed between the buried thin layer and the bulk, thereby improving the quality of the WBG perovskite film. Ultimately, an all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.30% is achieved.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) paired by wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites holds the potential to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation. However, the severe phase segregation and non&#8208;radiative recombination of WBG perovskite put on a shadow for their power conversion efficiency and stability. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy is introduced into the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. Potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK) is utilized to reconstruct the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. The distribution of (chlorine) Cl&#8722; changes from perovskite bulk toward the buried interface due to the TfOK addition. Therefore, a wider bandgap perovskite thin layer is formed at buried layer, which can form a graded heterojunction with bulk WBG perovskite to improve carrier separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the (potassium) K+ of TfOK diffuses into WBG perovskite bulk to suppress halide phase segregation. Consequently, the 1.78&#160;eV WBG PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.47% and an extremely high fill factor over 85%. Furthermore, the resultant two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieves a champion efficiency of 28.30%. This strategy provides a unique avenue to improve performance and photostability of WBG PSCs, a new function of Cl&#8722; in triple&#8208;halide is illustrated.

         <title>Spectrally Engineered Coatings for Steering the Solar Photons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrum&#8208;splitting energy synergy: a spectrally engineered radiative cooling (RC) coating with photoluminescence is integrated with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels to construct a hybrid biPV&#8208;RC system. By controlling solar photon conversion pathways and guiding light transport, the system enables synergistic power generation and daytime radiative cooling, offering a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral buildings.








Abstract
The spectral properties of radiative cooling (RC) and photovoltaic (PV) govern their capacity to utilize solar photons at distinct energy levels. However, spectral mismatches with the solar spectrum result in significant inefficiencies: non&#8208;photovoltaic heat losses in PV panels and wasted energy from reflected solar radiation in RC systems. To address this, a photoluminescent RC coating with spectrally selective reflectivity is developed to be&#160;integrated it with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels. The high reflectivity of the RC coating directs photons to the rear side of the PV panels, while its spectral selectivity optimizes the energy distribution of photons reaching the rear side, resulting in a 32% increase in the overall power output of the bifacial PV system. Additionally, the incorporation of photoluminescent materials enables the conversion of absorbed photons into luminescence rather than heat by suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This reduces effective solar absorption by 14% and enhances radiative cooling performance. Simulated urban rooftop deployment demonstrates that this dual&#8208;harvesting system meet &#8776;18.1% of Hong Kong's annual electricity demand, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon&#8208;neutral cities.

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.








Abstract
Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

         <title>Selective Lower&#8208;Occupied Through&#8208;Bond Interactions for Efficient Organic Phosphorescence Enabling High&#8208;Resolution Long&#8208;Wavelength Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective low&#8208;occupancy carbon&#8208;sulfur through&#8208;bond interactions enhance the organic red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to 46% yield with an emission lifetime of 0.43 s from materials without containing elements from the 4th period or higher. This significant improvement in organic red RTP yield enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow emission detection from individual nanoparticles even in the long wavelength region without relying on ambient autofluorescence. 








Abstract
Persistent organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow bioimaging, independent of autofluorescence. However, the yield of organic RTP in the long&#8208;wavelength region is generally low, which limits the high&#8208;resolution information that can be obtained from the long&#8208;wavelength region. Moreover, this makes it impossible to obtain multicolor and high&#8208;resolution afterglow images. This report describes a molecule containing no atoms from the fourth or higher period that exhibits efficient red RTP in high yield. A molecule with red phosphorescent chromophores substituted with multiple phenylthio groups reached an RTP yield of 46.3% and an RTP lifetime of 0.43 s in an appropriate crystalline host medium. The selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions among molecules significantly enhance the phosphorescence in the long&#8208;wavelength region. The highly efficient and bright red persistent RTP induces a red afterglow from individual nanoparticles. Tuning the selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions allows for the design of high&#8208;performance RTP dyes and offers a novel approach to explore high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color afterglow imaging.

     alt="Selective Lower-Occupied Through-Bond Interactions for Efficient Organic Phosphorescence Enabling High-Resolution Long-Wavelength Afterglow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective low-occupancy carbon-sulfur through-bond interactions enhance the organic red room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to 46% yield with an emission lifetime of 0.43 s from materials without containing elements from the 4th period or higher. This significant improvement in organic red RTP yield enables high-resolution afterglow emission detection from individual nanoparticles even in the long wavelength region without relying on ambient autofluorescence. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) enables high-resolution afterglow bioimaging, independent of autofluorescence. However, the yield of organic RTP in the long-wavelength region is generally low, which limits the high-resolution information that can be obtained from the long-wavelength region. Moreover, this makes it impossible to obtain multicolor and high-resolution afterglow images. This report describes a molecule containing no atoms from the fourth or higher period that exhibits efficient red RTP in high yield. A molecule with red phosphorescent chromophores substituted with multiple phenylthio groups reached an RTP yield of 46.3% and an RTP lifetime of 0.43 s in an appropriate crystalline host medium. The selective lower-occupied through-bond or through-space interactions among molecules significantly enhance the phosphorescence in the long-wavelength region. The highly efficient and bright red persistent RTP induces a red afterglow from individual nanoparticles. Tuning the selective lower-occupied through-bond or through-space interactions allows for the design of high-performance RTP dyes and offers a novel approach to explore high-resolution full-color afterglow imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Symmetric PbSe&#8208;Based Device for Thermoelectric Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from seven pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type), which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8, 36.9, and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303, 323, and 343 K, respectively.








Abstract
Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low&#8208;cost symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device exhibits superior cost&#8208;effectiveness (&#916;T/cost) for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi2Te3&#8208;based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb0.988Cu0.002Se act as strong p&#8208;type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room&#8208;temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Finally, the room&#8208;temperature figure of merit (ZT) and average ZT value in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p&#8208;type PbSe&#8208;based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost&#8208;effective PbSe compound for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature cooling applications.

Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.








Abstract
During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB&#8208;like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB&#8208;like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&#8208;trans conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.

         <title>Modulating Crystal Growth with Sacrificial Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via Intense Pulsed Light Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DodecylMSO, a sacrificial Lewis base additive, modulates perovskite crystallization during intense pulsed light annealing by strongly binding PbI&#8322; and volatilizing at high temperatures. This results in larger grains, lower defect density, and minimum trace residues, achieving the highest efficiency in its class.








Abstract
Intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing has emerged as a transformative technology for the high&#8208;throughput, low&#8208;cost fabrication of perovskite films, enabling the rapid conversion of precursor wet films into perovskite films within milliseconds. Despite their potential, the efficiencies of IPL&#8208;processed devices have yet to match those achieved through conventional thermal annealing (TA), primarily due to the challenges of uncontrolled crystallization and defect formation during the IPL process. In this study, a solid Lewis base additive, dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DodecylMSO) is introduced, to modulate perovskite crystal growth and improve film morphology and uniformity under IPL conditions. DodecylMSO acts as a sacrificial additive, with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirming the majority of it is removed in the final films. Compared to the control films, DodecylMSO&#8208;modified films exhibited significantly reduced defect densities and enhanced carrier extraction and transport properties. Leveraging this approach, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated with a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.5% fabricated via IPL. This sacrificial coordination strategy not only addresses key challenges in IPL processing but also opens new avenues for advancing the manufacturability and scalability of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;DodecylMSO, a sacrificial Lewis base additive, modulates perovskite crystallization during intense pulsed light annealing by strongly binding PbI&#8322; and volatilizing at high temperatures. This results in larger grains, lower defect density, and minimum trace residues, achieving the highest efficiency in its class.

         <title>Bifunctional Compound Induced Dual Back Surface Fields for Efficient Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer&#8208;free perovskite solar cells present a cost&#8208;effective and stable photovoltaic alternative but suffer from low efficiency due to the absence of back surface field (BSF). In this work,&#160;trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate&#160;is utilized to engineer&#160;dual BSFs, significantly enhancing open&#8208;circuit voltage and leading to a&#160;champion efficiency of 20.79%&#8212;marking a substantial improvement in device performance.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based hole transport layer&#8208;free (C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for low&#8208;cost and stable photovoltaics, but the HTL absence deteriorates their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the lack of back surface field (BSF). In this work, the benefits of forming dual BSFs in improving the PCE of C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs are first investigated by simulation. Then, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Tr+TPFB&#8722;) is introduced into the C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs by post&#8208;treatment for the first time, which enables the formation of dual BSFs. TPFB&#8722; passivates n&#8208;doping defects in perovskite and leads to the formation of perovskite n&#8208;p homojunction, while Tr+ extracts electrons from carbon and lowers its work function, which succeeds realizing dual BSFs. This improves the separation and extraction of photocarriers within the device, which is evidenced by the photoluminescence lifetime imaging of the device cross&#8208;section for the first time. As a result, the average open&#8208;circuit voltage increases significantly by about 70&#160;mV, which largely contributes to the improvement of PCE with a champion value of 20.79% obtained.

         <title>Functional Group Engineering Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Passivating Defects for Operationally Stable and Highly Reproducible Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of perovskite precursors is suppressed by modulating the position and type of functional groups in stabilizers. 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA), with the lowest pKa, effectively improved stability, passivated grain boundary defects, and increased carrier lifetime, leading to a maximum PCE of 26.79% in inverted PSCs fabricated by vacuum flash technology under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The pKa plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine&#8208;cation addition&#8208;elimination reaction. The 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA) with the lowest pKa is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Superior Energy Storage Performance in a Self&#8208;Organized Trirelaxor&#8208;Antiferroelectric Nanocomposite Over a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized nanocomposite addresses the challenge of energy storage materials degrading at high temperatures. The nanocomposite maintains exceptional performance from room temperature to 200&#160;&#176;C, with enhanced energy density and efficiency. Through the trirelaxor matrix and nanointerface with antiferroelectric nanoparticles, it offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, overcoming polarization and breakdown degradation at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
A fundamental paradox in energy storage dielectrics lies in the challenge of achieving superior performance consistently across both room and elevated temperatures. This is addressed by designing a self&#8208;organized nanocomposite (1&#8722;x)(Ba,Sr)(Ti,Sn)O3&#8208;xBi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 composed of nano&#8208;sized antiferroelectric(AFE) particles embedded into a trirelaxor(TRE) matrix through nanoscale phase separation process. The optimal composition at x = 0.11 exhibits outstanding energy storage performance from room temperature (energy density = 8.5 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency = 94.8%, and figure of merit of 167 J&#160;cm&#8722;3) up to 200&#160;&#176;C (energy density = 4.85 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency &gt;90% and figure of merit of 49 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), outperforming existing Pb&#8208;free dielectrics. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffractometry reveal that the coexisting nanometric antiferroelectric particles and the trirelaxor nanodomains sustain over a wide temperature range. Piezoresponse force microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulation show that hysteresis&#8208;free switching of trirelaxor nanodomains enables enhanced polarization and low hysteretic loss. Resistivity shows a 2&#8211;3 order of magnitude increases accompanying significant increase in breakdown strength up to high temperatures, attributable to deep charge trapping effect at high&#8208;density TRE/AFE interfaces as evidenced by thermally stimulated depolarization current. These favorable effects in the nano&#8208;composite are responsible for its high energy storage performance up to high temperatures.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

     alt="Full-Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full-color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning-based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single-detector designs. Acquiring high-dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning-based reconstruction, a full-color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembling Octahedral Pt2Ag4 Clusters for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of alloy clusters composed of two Pt2Ag4 monomer are synthesized. Chiral structural transformations occurred in response to solvent stimuli, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast chiroptical switching. By manipulation of such chiral clusters, a chiral cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence is achieved. Further, the application in the information encryptions is explored.








Abstract
Establishing atom&#8208;precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters to achieve high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is especially fascinating, yet it creates considerable challenges. Here, two enantiomeric pairs of dimer clusters R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;green and R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange composed of two octahedral Pt2Ag4 monomers through Pt&#8211;Pt bonds are constructed, which show a 28&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) compared with the reported monomer in solution. The solid&#8208;state chiral dimer R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange shows a PLQY of 87% without an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. The intercluster distances and arrangements of the chiral cluster can be modulated through the ligand configuration and solvent stimuli, giving rise to the reversible transformations between chiral single crystals, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast optical/chiroptical switching. Additionally, by further assembling chiral Pt&#8208;Ag clusters with Ag+, a chiral 3D cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency red&#8208;emitting CPL is achieved. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency luminescence, intrinsic chirality, and the adjustable assembly behaviors of these chiral cluster assemblies bestow them with excellent smart CPL switching properties. This work opens a new avenue for high&#8208;efficiency CPL&#8208;active metal clusters by regulating metal&#8208;metal interactions.

         <title>Tunable Bipolar Photothermoelectric Response from Mott Activation for In&#8208;Sensor Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a gate&#8208;tunable bipolar photothermoelectric detector using a vanadium dioxide film transistor. The device offers broadband photoresponse, linear light&#8208;intensity dependence, adjustable responsivities, low energy use (8 pJ&#160;per spike), and high stability (over 5000 cycles). An integrated convolutional network excels in broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, highlighting its potential for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor image preprocessing, a subset of edge computing, offers a solution to mitigate frequent analog&#8208;digital conversions and the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional digital hardware. However, an efficient in&#8208;sensor device array with large&#8208;scale integration capability for high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power sensory processing is still lacking and highly desirable. This work introduces an adjustable broadband photothermoelectric detector based on a phase&#8208;change vanadium dioxide thin&#8208;film transistor. This transistor employs a vanadium dioxide/gallium nitride three&#8208;terminal structure with a gate&#8208;tunable phase transition at the gate&#8208;source junctions. This design allows for modulable photothermoelectric responsivities and alteration of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent's polarities. The devices exhibit linear gate dependence for the broadband photoresponse and linear light&#8208;intensity dependence for both positive and negative photoresponsivities. The device's energy consumption is as low as 8 pJ per spike, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of previous Mott materials&#8208;based in&#8208;sensor preprocessing devices. A wafer&#8208;scale bipolar phototransistor array has also been fabricated by standard micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;fabrication techniques, exhibiting excellent stability and endurance (over 5000 cycles). More importantly, an integrated in&#8208;sensor convolutional network is successfully designed for simultaneous broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, delivering exceptional performance and paving the way for future smart edge sensors.

The combination of metal single atoms and heterojunctions creates a ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field, providing a novel and innovative photocatalyst structure for improving photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterojunctions can significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, among which Z&#8208;type heterojunctions are more conducive to photocatalysis due to their special transfer paths and strong oxidizing and reducing properties. However, introducing efficient active sites has always been a significant challenge in the improvement of heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, through in&#8208;depth analysis of the reaction mechanism and structural characteristics, single atom catalysts and heterojunctions are ingeniously integrated using built&#8208;in electric fields. For the first time, the suitable metal single atom active sites are successfully designed under the special electronic structure at the N&#8208;terminal, utilizing low electronegativity non&#8208;metallic element doping to counteract local electron migration from heterojunctions. Ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field composed of the divergent and parallel built&#8208;in electric fields from single atom catalysts and heterojunctions respectively, which introduces a new carrier separation path. AgPCN/BCN heterojunction reaches a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yield 559.5&#160;&#181;M&#8729;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 17.8% through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. Photoelectrochemical tests indicate the importance of 4e&#8722; water oxidation reaction as an auxiliary reaction. This novel and innovative photocatalyst structure brings new approaches for photocatalysts improvement, and new insights into the role of built&#8208;in electric fields in photocatalytic reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Cellular Glycocalyx Affects Nanoparticle Access to Cell Membranes and Uptake</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cellular glycocalyx is a dense and negatively charged layer of carbohydrates that ubiquitously coats cells. Nanoparticles must permeate through the glycocalyx to access receptors on the cell surface. The glycocalyx layer regulates cellular access to nanoparticles via charge&#8208;charge interactions. By varying nanoparticle surface charges, researchers can control nanoparticle uptake to enhance the specificity of targeted drug delivery systems.









Abstract
Understanding nanoparticle interactions with cells is fundamental to designing them for medical applications. Nanoparticles must interface with the cell surface to be bound and taken up. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate layer coating the cell surface, rendering it negatively charged. Many researchers have noted that the glycocalyx affects nanoparticle uptake, but the mechanism remains unknown,&#160;Here, we investigate the interaction between the glycocalyx and nanoparticles at the cell surface in different cell types. The glycocalyx reduced the interactions between the nanoparticles and cells, thereby reducing cellular access, binding, and uptake. The magnitude of the effect is dependent on the nanoparticle charge. Fine&#8208;tuning the charge of nanoparticles can enhance the specificity of nanoparticle targeting. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in nano&#8208;bio interactions will allow researchers to control the interactions of nanoparticles with the cell surface.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Rare Earth Oxides Anchoring Tunable Cu&#948;+ Nanochimneys for Self&#8208;Tandem C&#8208;C Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for 2D high&#8208;entropy rare earth oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) featuring lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies is developed, representing an emerging platform for anchoring Cu&#948;+ nano&#8208;domains with tunable oxidation states. The HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts exhibit largely exposed synergistic sites that facilitate *CO spillover, while stabilized optimal Cu&#948;+ chimneys promote C&#9472;C couplings and interfacial channels that delocalize electrons, thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based materials are promising for carbon&#8208;carbon bond (C&#9472;C) coupling catalysis, but they are limited to poor structural stability, high activation energy, and low selectivity toward C2+ products. Here a customized synthetic protocol is defined for the fabrication of 2D ultrathin high&#8208;entropy rare earth (RE) oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) with rich lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies, which act as robust supports for anchoring Cu&#948;+ serial domains with tunable oxidation states. The rationally integrated HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ heterostructures feature largely exposed synergistic multi&#8208;site driving rapid *CO spillover, and multiple stabilized Cu&#948;+ chimneys promoting cascade *CO coupling, together with intrinsic electron activation channels enabling RE 4f electron delocalization to lower the energy barrier. The optimal CeZrZnAgPbO&#8208;Cu0.44+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 51.7% for C2+ gaseous products at a low potential of &#8208;0.9&#160;V versus (vs) reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in H&#8208;type cell. The study proposes an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; design principle for advanced RE&#8208;based catalysts through integrating advantageous individuals in a predictable manner.

         <title>Modular Design of T Cell Nanoengagers for Tumor Immunotherapy via Genetically Engineered Lipid&#8208;Tagged Antibody Fragments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; strategy for constructing T cell nanoengagers by directly embedding genetically engineered lipid&#8208;tagged antibodies into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This versatile approach enables the design of both bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;specific nanoengagers, which effectively recruit T cells to tumor cells, enhance T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and mitigate T cell exhaustion.









Abstract
T cell engagers, which bind tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell specific molecules, represent a promising class of immunotherapies for enhancing targeted immune responses. Here, a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; platform is introduced for engineering T cell nanoengagers by anchoring antibody fragments into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This approach utilizes a genetically engineered lipoprotein fused with single&#8208;chain variable fragments (scFv) and nanobodies, which spontaneously integrate into lipid bilayer of the nanoparticles, achieving a high surface density of at least 0.102&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2 (&#8776;3200&#160;scFv per particle). Modular bi&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;BiTE) and tri&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;TriTE) immunoliposomes are designed to enhance anti&#8208;tumor T cell immune responses. The Lipo&#8208;BiTE, integrating anti&#8208;CD3 and anti&#8208;HER2 scFv at an optimized surface density of 1.28&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2, exhibits enhanced CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity in HER2&#8208;positive tumor models by simultaneously engaging tumor cells and T cells. Incorporating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanobodies to create Lipo&#8208;TriTE further addresses T cell exhaustion. This modular platform provides a robust foundation for designing immune cell engagers, with broad applications in targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Fluorine Engineering Induces Phase Transformation in NiCo2O4 for Enhanced Active Motifs Formation in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely manipulating the reconstruction process to generate specific active motifs remains challenging during the alkaline OER. NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn, structured with NiCo2O4 cores and (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shells, facilitate the dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase with Ov forming at a lower voltage than the single&#8208;metal NiOOH in NiCo2O4, which is demonstrated by in situ Raman and XAFS. The NiCoOOH generation is attributed to the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 hydroxide in electrolyte without bias. Consequently, NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn exhibits enhanced OER intrinsic activities compared to NiCo2O4.









Abstract
Dynamic reconstruction of catalysts is key to active site formation in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but precise control over this process remains challenging. Herein, F&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn), consisting of a NiCo2O4 core and a (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shell is reported, which promotes the formation of a dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the NiCoOOH, rich in oxygen vacancies (Ov), forms at 1.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for NiCo2O4&#8208;F1, in contrast to the NiOOH phase formation at 1.4&#160;V versus RHE for undoped NiCo2O4. This is facilitated by the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into amorphous NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte without bias. Electrochemical tests show that NiCo2O4&#8208;F1 exhibits a 14&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity compared to NiCo2O4. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ov&#8208;induced unsaturated Co and Ni sites enhance electroactivity by promoting *OH intermediates adsorption and conversion, lowering the OER energy barrier. The oriented control of NiCoOOH active motifs in NiCo2O4 spinel, achieved through fluorine engineering, paves a new avenue for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Oriented SnO2 Nanocrystals for Air&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.87%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAC&#8208;AA into SnO2 colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high&#8208;oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO2 lattice matching. The f&#8208;PSCs fabricated in full&#8208;air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.








Abstract
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n&#8208;type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs).

&lt;p&gt;DAC-AA into SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high-oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice matching. The f-PSCs fabricated in full-air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin (IV) oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n-type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs). The (110) facet-dominated SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; colloids are readily created, whereas other best-performing (101) and (200) facets-dominated ones with superior potential in interface modulation and lattice matching remain insufficiently explored. Here water-soluble acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride-acrylamine (DAC-AA) doping into SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; colloids produces more (101)- and (200)-oriented crystal domains through lowering surface absorption energy and offering additional thermodynamic driving force. Theoretical and experimental analyses corroborate that the grain preference orientation induced by DAC-AA modification strengthens heating transfer rate on the flexible substrate and favors lattice matching of perovskite (100) plane on SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (101) and (200) facets.

         <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband polycrystalline lithium niobate platform is developed for highly versatile and scalable fabrication of nonlinear metasurfaces. This work demonstrates simultaneous second harmonic generation and wavefront&#8208;shaping via a metalens on this platform. The high effective optical nonlinearity enables broadband frequency doubled light focusing for power density enhancement from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared spectral range.








Abstract
Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost&#8208;effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top&#8208;down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom&#8208;up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution&#8208;derived material with high effective second&#8208;order nonlinearity deff of 5&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1. On this platform, second&#8208;harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low&#8208;cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Screening Natural Cholesterol Analogs to Assemble Self&#8208;Adjuvant Lipid Nanoparticles for Antigens Tagging Guided Therapeutic Tumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol analogs ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 are screened to assemble lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver nucleic acid antigens to tumors and lymph nodes for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells activation, thus guiding CTL to accurately recognize and kill tumor cells. Besides, ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 can reshape tumor microenvironment by inhibiting STAT3. Collectively, this work has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.








Abstract
The clinical progress of tumor nucleotide vaccines is limited due to insufficient recognition and killing of tumor cells with low antigen expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, natural cholesterol analogs are screened to assemble self&#8208;adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC) activation. First, a library of ginsenosides are collected, and then screened according to their anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Then, ginsenoside&#8208;Rg3 based&#8208;LNPs loaded with antigens (Rg3&#8208;LNPs) are identified as the optimal formulation by investigating the physicochemical and biological properties. Finally, Rg3&#8208;LNPs and granulocyte&#8208;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GM&#8208;CSF) are co&#8208;loaded into a macroporous hydrogel for long&#8208;term immune response. Rg3&#8208;LNPs could accumulate into both tumors and LNs. Rg3&#8208;LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter&#8208;1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3&#8208;LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM&#8208;CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.

Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields
The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS2 basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number 2411211 by Hyeong&#8208;U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202411211"&gt;2411211&lt;/a&gt; by Hyeong-U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co-workers.

All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In article number 2414596 by Emre B. Boz, Ameya Bondre, Ronald de Bruijne, and Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.

Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks
The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod&#8208;shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co&#8208;workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number 2501946.

Flame Treatment
A rapid and scalable high&#8208;temperature flame technique is developed to enable surface reconstruction of sulfide semiconductor photoelectrode for enhanced photoelectrochemical(PEC) performances. In article number 2403164, Sung Sik Shin, Xiaolin Zheng, Sun Cho, and their team demonstrate rapid surface reconstruction of Indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode using the flame process. The flame process transforms the In2S3 surface into a 5 nm&#8208;thin In2O3 layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2.

The flame process transforms the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface into a 5 nm-thin In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys natural biomaterials and nature&#8208;inspired artificial materials as additives for metal halide perovskite films in optoelectronics, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. It discusses how these biomaterials differ from conventional materials in terms of their impact on device performance from both mechanistic and functional viewpoints. Although solar cell applications dominate, reports on other applications are rapidly increasing.








Abstract
This comprehensive review meticulously categorizes and discusses the applications of diverse biomaterials, specifically natural and nature&#8208;inspired synthetic materials in metal halide perovskite optoelectronics. Applications range from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. Emphasis is placed on the intricate interactions between bio&#8208;additives and perovskite crystals, highlighting their influence on the grain size, crystal orientation, grain boundaries, and surface passivation. This review also explores the advantages and disadvantages of each natural or nature&#8208;inspired material and their unique properties compared with conventional additives. Special attention is given to the mechanistic and functional viewpoints, showing how these biomaterials enhance device performance. Through additive engineering with ecofriendly biomaterials, defects in metal halide perovskite thin films can be effectively passivated, thus extending the photostability or in some cases mechanical flexibility of devices. This review provides valuable insights for selecting and designing next&#8208;generation biomaterial additives, offering new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite layers and advancing the field of peorvskite&#8208; based optoelectronics.

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Material Selection and Device Design of Scalable Flexible Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces: A Balance Between Electrical and Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

This review explores the balance between electrical and mechanical performance of flexible BCIs through the careful selection of electronic materials and probe design to achieve long&#8208;term stable neural recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) hold the potential to revolutionize brain function restoration, enhance human capability, and advance our understanding of cognitive mechanisms by directly linking neural signals with hardware. However, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid BCIs and soft brain tissue limits long&#8208;term interface stability. Next&#8208;generation BCIs must achieve long&#8208;term biocompatibility while maintaining high performance, enabling the integration of millions of sensors within tissue&#8208;level flexible and soft, stable neural interfaces. Lithographic fabrication techniques provide scalable thin&#8208;film flexible electronics, but traditional electronic materials often fail to meet the unique requirements of BCIs. This review examines the selection of materials and device design for flexible BCIs, starting with an analysis of intrinsic material properties&#8212;Young's modulus, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant. It then explores the integration of material selection with electrode design to optimize electrical circuits and assess key mechanical factors. Next, the correlation between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed to guide material selection and device design. Finally, recent advances in neural probes are reviewed, highlighting improvements in signal quality, recording stability, and scalability. This review focuses on scalable, lithography&#8208;based BCIs, aiming to identify optimal materials and designs for long&#8208;term, reliable neural recordings.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

&lt;p&gt;The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure-guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget-stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo-electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <title>Conductive Polymer Coatings Control Reaction Selectivity in All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Targeted Nanoparticles with PI3K/mTOR Dual Inhibitor Downregulate P&#8208;Glycoprotein and Inactivate Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self&#8208;doped PEDOT (S&#8208;PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&#8722;3), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Mechanically resilient hydrogels with ion&#8208;electron mixed transport properties effectively bridge biology with electronics. An ideal bioelectronic interface can be realized through introducing electronically conductive polymers into supramolecular hydrogels. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have limited mechanical properties and ion&#8208;electron interactions. Here, supramolecular conductive hydrogels that possess homogeneous ionic and electronic transport are achieved. The materials demonstrate high toughness (620&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), stretchability (&gt;1000%), softness (10.5&#160;kPa), and conductivity (5.8&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which surpasses commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based hydrogels. The homogeneous network leads to higher charge injection capacitance and lower skin impedance compared to commercial electrodes or commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS conducting networks. This significant advance arises from the homogeneous incorporation of the hydrophilic self&#8208;doped conducting polymer S&#8208;PEDOT, which has polymerized within a supramolecular polymer network template mediated by high&#8208;binding affinity host&#8208;guest crosslinks. Furthermore, the compatibility of S&#8208;PEDOT with hydrophilic secondary networks enables the realization of fully dryable and reswellable electronic devices, facilitating reusability and improving their ease of handling. It is anticipated that achieving such material architectures will offer a promising new direction in future synthesis and implementation of conductive hydrogels in the field of&#160;bioelectronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Torque Magnetization Switching Due to Spin Berry Curvature Generated by Minute Spontaneous Atomic Displacement in a Weyl Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer magnetization switching with a small critical current density of &#8776;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is demonstrated. The strong intrinsic spin Hall effect, causing the switching, is induced by the synergy of the inherent spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the spontaneous oxygen octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.The findings highlight the immense potential for realizing efficient material systems for spin&#8208;orbitronics applications by precise atom positioning.








Abstract
Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach is not applied to devices; generally, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT&#8208;induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single&#8208;crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight&#8208;binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single&#8208;crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin&#8208;orbitronics devices.

Here, SOT-induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; layer of a single-crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight-binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single-crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin-orbitronics devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two&#8208;photon lithography&#8208;assisted molding, magnetic soft double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini&#8208;turbine assembly, and high&#8208;speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non&#8208;magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high&#8208;throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) &#8208; mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>

The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Non&#8208;Reciprocal Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact and efficient on&#8208;chip isolator is experimentally demonstrated by integrating magneto&#8208;optical InSb onto a terahertz silicon topological chip. The simultaneous breaking of spatial and temporal reversal symmetries forms a valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal waveguide mode, enabling a compact cavity size of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2 and a low insertion loss of 2.6 dB, with actively tunable isolation ratios up to 64.3 dB.








Abstract
Chip&#8208;scale non&#8208;reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non&#8208;reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto&#8208;optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time&#8208;reversal and spatial&#8208;inversion symmetries, enable ultra&#8208;compact and efficient non&#8208;reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3&#160;dB and a low chip loss of 2.6&#160;dB is experimentally achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the non&#8208;reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2. An all&#8208;optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48&#160;dB. The development of a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

         <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque&#8208;driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer&#8208;twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE&#8208;NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE&#8208;NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

     alt="Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium-Rich Perovskite Absorbers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors show that the (011)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium-rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)-faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in-and out-of-plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in-depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high-quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade-coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU-treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, retained &amp;gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &amp;gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ETU-treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &amp;gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1-sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance 721 nm&#8208;Excitable Photon Upconversion Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Broad&#8208;Range Oxygen Sensing and Efficient Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion porous aromatic frameworks (UC PAFs) was constructed and applied to a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and efficient heterogeneous photoredox catalysis. Moreover, homogeneous triple exciton energy is recognized to facilitate exciton diffusion, resulting in a high upconversion quantum yield (1.5% with an upper limit of 50%).








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;wavelength excitable solid upconversion materials and the regulation of exciton behavior is important for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and other emerging applications. However, the approaches for regulating exciton diffusion are very limited, resulting in extremely poor photonic upconversion performance in solid&#8208;state. Here, the annihilation unit is integrated into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and loaded with photosensitizer to construct efficient 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion material (upconversion quantum yield up to 1.5%, upper limit 50%). Most importantly, we found that the steric hindrance of annihilator units breaks the &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the annihilation unit and the PAFs framework to form the homogeneous triplet exciton energy, which is conducive to the exciton diffusion. After increasing the exciton diffusion constant from 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 to 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1, the upconversion quantum yield is increased &#8776; 50&#8208;fold. Further, this solid upconversion material is utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and 721 nm&#8208;driven heterogeneous and recyclable photoredox catalysis. These findings provide an important approach for regulating the behavior of triplet exciton in disorder solid materials to gain better upconversion performance, which will advance practical applications of organic photon upconversion in energy, chemistry, and photonics.

         <title>Revealing Trapped Carrier Dynamics at Buried Interfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Infrared&#8208;Modulated Action Spectroscopy with Surface Photovoltage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spectroscopy technique (i.e., pump&#8208;push&#8208;surface photovoltage) is introduced that monitors trapped carrier dynamics at the buried interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) via combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization. 








Abstract
Interfacial engineering is a proven strategy to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by controlling surface electronic defects and carrier trapping. The trap states at the &#8220;top&#8221; interface between the perovskite and upper charge extraction layers are experimentally accessible and have been extensively studied. However, the understanding of the unexposed &#8220;bottom&#8221; surface of the perovskite layer remains elusive, due to the lack of selective and non&#8208;destructive tools to access buried interface. Here, a new spectroscopy technique is introduced that monitors nanosecond to millisecond dynamics of trapped carriers at the buried interfaces by combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. Applied to various PeSC architectures, this method reveals that most interfacial traps reside between the perovskite and hole transport layer, suggesting a predominance of hole traps (e.g., cation and lead vacancies) over electron traps (e.g., halide vacancies) in the studied PeSC systems. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector in metal&#8208;free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X&#8208;ray detector achieves ultra&#8208;high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskite (MFP) X&#8208;ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X&#8208;ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X&#8208;ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE&#8208;NH4Br3 H2O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;103 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (&#8208;55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X&#8208;ray detectors.

     alt="Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal-Free Perovskite for Efficient Self-Powered X-Ray Detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self-powered X-ray detector in metal-free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X-ray detector achieves ultra-high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free perovskite (MFP) X-ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X-ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X-ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self-powered X-ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (-55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X-ray detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN monoliths with unsaturated Mo&#8211;N coordination structures are fabricated through solid&#8208;state phase transformation. The porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long&#8208;term stability across all&#8208;pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.








Abstract
Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution. Free&#8211;standing PSC MoN electrode with the pore size of &#8776;6&#160;nm and porosity of &#8776;72% present both noble&#8211;metal&#8211;like electronic structure and unsaturated Mo&#9472;N coordination structures at surface, contributing to remarkably high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The unprecedented overpotentials of as low as 13 and 11&#160;mV are presented at the geometrical current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution in H2SO4 (pH 0) and KOH (pH 14) media, respectively, which is dramatically superior to commercial Pt electrodes. As a result of the structural stability, the outstanding long&#8211;term durability for all pH hydrogen evolution is demonstrated without visible degradation in a continuous operation for 300&#160;h.

         <title>Energy Transfer Loop Enables Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with &gt;20% EQE and Near&#8208;Zero Roll&#8208;Offs at 104 Nits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence diodes with the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% and the record&#8208;low EQE roll&#8208;off of only 2.6% at 104 nits is first realized through an &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy, in which a TADF sensitizer 24DDMACPPPO with vibration&#8208;free reverse intersystem crossing is used to displace TADF emitter in triplet&#8208;singlet up&#8208;conversion for phonon decoupling, leading to markedly enhanced radiation and suppressed quenching.








Abstract
The bottleneck in efficiency stability at high luminance limits the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes, due to the insufficient management of quenching factors, especially exciton&#8208;phonon coupling during reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) assistant with vibrational coupling. Herein, this challenge is overcome by a TADF sensitizer based &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy. A dimethylacridine&#8208;phosphole oxide hybrid sensitizer named 24DDMACPPPO is constructed with vibration&#8208;free RISC and excited&#8208;state energy levels equal to a TADF emitter 4CzTPNBu. The former displaces the latter in RISC for phonon decoupling through reverse triplet and positive singlet energy transfer between them. As a result, co&#8208;doping 0&#160;.1%wt. 24DDMACPPPO doubles the RISC rate constant and triples the singlet radiation rate of 4CzTPNBu, and simultaneously nearly halves non&#8208;radiation rate constants, giving rise to 70% and 90% increased photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies of 4CzTPNBu. More importantly, the energy transfer loop between 24DDMACPPPO and 4CzTPNBu combines their advantages in RISC, quenching suppression, and singlet radiation, giving rise to the record values of external quantum efficiency (&#8776;23%wt.) and roll&#8208;off (2.6%) at 104&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

         <title>Synergistic Interface Engineering via o&#8208;Difluorobenzene&#8208;Mediated HPWO Crystallization and ITO Fluorination for 20.57% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;action optimization strategy is developed combining the fluorination of ITO electrodes with precisely controlled crystallization of phosphotungstic acid, which establishes favorable energy level alignment and reduces interface trap density to obtain 20.57% efficiency of organic solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial energy loss is a critical challenge in achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), primarily due to mismatched energy levels and inefficient charge collection. Herein, a bifunctional interface engineering strategy is proposed, employing an ethanol/o&#8208;difluorobenzene (EtOH/o&#8208;DFB) dual&#8208;solvent system for phosphotungstic acid (HPWO) processing. During film formation, o&#8208;DFB regulates HPWO crystallization by suppressing excessive aggregation, while enabling in situ ITO fluorination through the adsorbed o&#8208;DFB. This synergistic approach simultaneously mitigates the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer while enhancing the electrode work function, resulting in better ohmic contact, minimized trap&#8208;state densities, and improved energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer interface. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated across multiple active layer systems. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 19.55%, 20.07%, and 20.57% are achieved for PM6/L8&#8208;BO, D18/L8&#8208;BO, and D18/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs, respectively. Notably, the 20.57% PCE represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for OSCs, highlighting the potential of this bifunctional interface engineering strategy in advancing high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

This study reports the preparation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) via a solid&#8208;phase synthesis method, combined with cyanobacteria (Cyan) to effectively alleviate hypoxia. These components are confined within the tumor microenvironment using a thermosensitive hydrogel, enhancing the sensitivity of radiotherapy for colorectal and lung cancers. By alleviating hypoxia through cyanobacteria&#8208;mediated photosynthetic oxygenation, La2O3 NPs not only promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, triggering pyroptosis via GSDMD activation, but also amplify radiotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis mediated by GSDME. This dual mechanism provides a powerful strategy to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced radiotherapy resistance in colorectal and lung cancers.








Abstract
Rectal cancer surgery is challenging due to the complex anatomy, making it difficult to achieve clear surgical margins. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role, especially in treating locally recurrent rectal cancer and preserving anal function. However, its effectiveness is often limited by tumor hypoxia, particularly prevalent in hypoxic regions near the bowel wall in colorectal cancer. Hypoxia contributes to both radiation resistance and apoptosis resistance, compromising RT outcomes. To overcome hypoxia&#8208;driven radiotherapy resistance, this work designs and engineers a radiotherapy&#8208;sensitizing bioplatform for efficient cancer RT. It combines lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) with cyanobacteria, which produces oxygen through photosynthesis. This bioplatform uniquely reduces tumor hypoxia, enhances radiation deposition, and improves RT efficacy. La2O3 NPs further enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by radiation, triggering pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway, while RT amplifies pyroptosis through GSDME, circumventing tumor apoptosis resistance. The further integrated thermosensitive hydrogels ensure precise localization of the bioplatform, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic specificity. Compared to conventional therapies, this dual&#8208;action system addresses hypoxia, RT resistance, and apoptosis resistance more effectively. In vivo and in vitro hypoxia models validate its potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, offering valuable insights for refining clinical treatment paradigms.

         <title>AI&#8208;Generated Ammonium Ligands for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning procedure combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) model are used to accelerate the generation of ammonium ligands (ALs) in 2D perovskites. The relationship between the carrier transport barrier and the structure of ALs is explored. Utilizing the AI&#8208;designed ALs significantly enhances the carrier transport of the 2D perovskites, leading to high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable stability, but the quantum well in the 2D perovskite capping layer hinders the carrier transport, thereby lowering the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The relationship between the transport barrier and the complex structure of ammonium ligands (ALs) is currently poorly understood, thus leading to the one&#8208;sided approach and inefficient process in the development of 2D perovskite. Here, a machine learning procedure is established to comprehensively explore the relationship and combined it with an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on reinforcement learning algorithm to accelerate the generation of ALs. Finally, the AI&#8208;designed ALs improved the carrier transport performance of the 2D perovskite capping layer, and we achieved a certified PCE of 26.12% in inverted PSCs. The devices retained 96.79% of the initial PCE after 2000 h operation in maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#176;C.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Customized Multifunctional Additive Regulates 1.67 eV&#8208;Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Crystallization for Four&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fluorinated Ni Single Atom Catalyst for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, synergistic spatial and electronic structure regulation of conjugated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts are achieved through a dual&#8208;fluorination strategy. Under diluted CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni obtains the highest reported CO yield (30344.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with 98% CO selectivity.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO2 from flue gas into high value&#8208;added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual&#8208;fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 to CO. Under a dilute CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual&#8208;fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO2 adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual&#8208;F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni&#8208;N2O2 active site to capture CO2 molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from flue gas into high value-added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual-fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. Under a dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (10%) atmosphere, TPB-SA2F-Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual-fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual-F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active site to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB-SA2F-Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Deposition of Antigen Peptides on Bifidobacterium for Subintestinal Lymphatic System&#8208;Guided Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to target gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#160;at mucosal sites. This targeted approach strengthens both mucosal and systemic immunes responses. These immune responses enable the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and progression.








Abstract
Gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) possesses a highly specialized immune system and is rational as a foothold for oral tumor vaccines. Here, a noninvasive oral vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to engage GALT, inducing both intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity for tumor therapeutics. The vaccine uses Bifidobacterium (Bif) as a delivery vehicle for tumor antigen peptides, which are coated with antigen peptides (OVA) and oxidized curdlan (Ocur) in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) manner. Upon oral administration, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur is efficiently directed to Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestines and further presented to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) to evoke specific T cell responses. In mouse models, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur effectively boosts the production of secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) and promotes a strong mucosal and systemic immune response, leading to significant tumor suppression and resistance to tumor challenges. Importantly, the vaccine shows no systemic toxicity. This approach to harnessing the intestinal mucosal immune system offers valuable insights for the development of other non&#8208;invasive oral vaccines and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano-type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8221; (Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;), reflecting limited Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by lowering &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt; increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate-determining step for high-rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Photogenetic&#8208;Like Liposomes Disrupt Neuroligin&#8208;3 Dependency to Enhance Glioma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a light&#8208;responsive liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA that synergizes photothermal therapy (CuS/980&#160;nm) with dual NLGN3 regulation: RuBi&#8208;GABA/UCNPs suppress NLGN3 synthesis via Cl&#8315; channels, while GI254023X inhibits ADAM10&#8208;mediated release. In glioma models, this strategy blocks PI3K/Wnt pathways, reduces stemness, and prolongs survival through combined neuromodulation&#8208;photothermal effects.








Abstract
Neuronal activity is shown to potentiate glioma initiation, progression, and/or metastasis. A key mechanism in neural regulation of brain cancer involves the activity&#8208;dependent cleavage and release of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin&#8208;3 (NLGN3). Here, this report describes the preparation of optogenetics&#8208;like liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA, which is used to regulate the content of NLGN3 in neurons and mediate phototherapy in cancer cells. Lip&#8208;CuRA contains upconversion nanoparticles encapsulating CuS (CuS@PUCNPs), a visible light&#8208;activated neurotransmitter prodrug RuBi&#8208;GABA, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10) inhibitors GI254023X. Upon 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of CuS not only induces tumor cell apoptosis, but also destroys liposome structure, releasing Rubi&#8208;GABA and GI254023X. The UCNPs convert the 980&#160;nm laser into 540&#160;nm, activating RuBi&#8208;GABA into GABA. GABA selectively opens Cl&#8315; channels in nerve cells, reducing the expression of NLGN3 and the degree of axonal connections. GI254023X inhibits the activity of the ADAM10 enzyme on the nerve surface, reducing the release of NLGN3, thereby blocking the transmission of proliferation and stemness signals. In the GL261&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, C6&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, and glioma patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model, Lip&#8208;CuRA effectively inhibits tumor recurrence, reduces glioma stemness, and extends survival through a synergistic photothermal and NLGN3&#8208;regulating therapy.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Nanocathode for Synchronized Generation of Picosecond Pulsed Electron Beam and Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au&#8208;on&#8208;Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation. The nanocathode achieved 80 MHz electron pulses with a 500 ps pulsewidth, 0.91 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 peak current density, 6.53% external quantum efficiency, and 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 reduced brightness. Additionally, it exhibited a 7.1&#176; divergence angle and 0.97 eV energy spread under low excitations. Synchronized radiation pulses at 2.3, 5.7, and 9.2 GHz corresponded to electron pulse features. The excellent performance stems from plasmonic field enhancement and efficient hot electron generation driven by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the PMEE nanocathode. The dynamic effects of high&#8208;energy hot electron injection at the Au&#8208;Gr interface also play a critical role. This system enables compact, room&#8208;temperature, low&#8208;power vacuum electronic devices for ultra&#8208;high spatiotemporal resolution and high&#8208;frequency applications, driving progress in materials science and nanotechnology.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

Finally, N2200-modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large-area module (16.94 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air-printing large-scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non-halogenated solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermodynamically&#8208;Driven Phase Engineering and Reconstruction Deduction of Medium&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

         <title>Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.








Abstract
This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high&#8208;fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non&#8208;overlapped domains with nearest&#8208;neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration. The application of these models to the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset reveals their efficiency and the recognizability of decompressed images, which is validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In particular, Model B2, a version of Model B, emerges as an effective method for balancing high information density (surpassing over 20 times the typical densities of two bits per nucleotide) with reasonably good image quality. These findings highlight the potential of DNA&#8208;based data storage systems for high&#8208;density and efficient compression, indicating a promising future for biological data storage solutions.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Ferroelectric Stochasticity in 2D CuInP2S6 and Its Application for True Random Number Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a true random number generator (TRNG) based on stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D CuInP2S6 materials, is reported. The TRNG exhibits exceptional stochastic variability, surpassing conventional entropy metrics, and passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. Moreover, TRNG's unclonability is demonstrated through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, providing resilience against machine learning (ML) attacks.








Abstract
True random number generators (TRNGs), which create cryptographically secure random bitstreams, hold great promise in addressing security concerns regarding hardware, communication, and authentication in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS&#8208;based TRNG is circuit&#8208;integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption.

         <title>Spiking Neural Network Integrated with Impact Ionization Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Neuron and a Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Synapse</title>

2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

         <title>Percolative Metal Microweb&#8208;Based Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Fast Charging and High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer. As a result, the lithium&#8208;ion battery developed here exhibits exceptional energy and power densities of 110 and 1048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, respectively.








Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb&#8208;based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials. The design of the electrode proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of wearable and flexible electronics.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra&#8208;Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer&#8208;scale semiconductor applications.








Abstract
The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO2/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy&#8208;based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically&#8208;thin carbon. Additionally, I&#8208;V characterization and high&#8208;frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer&#8208;level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer&#8208;free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.

In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Decoding the Role of Molecular Orientation in Conjugated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates how the molecular orientation of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) governs work function (WF) modulation via alignment of the conjugated core with the surface normal. Edge&#8208;on&#8208;oriented BCZ&#8208;1 molecule maximizes vertical dipole moments and achieves dense in&#8208;plane coverage, enabling ultrafast hole extraction and minimized recombination. The resultant binary organic photovoltaics achieve a record efficiency of 19.93%, highlighting orientation engineering as a pivotal strategy for high&#8208;performance devices.








Abstract
Molecular orientation stands as the quintessential hallmark of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have recently catalyzed noteworthy advancements in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, an unambiguous understanding of these directional arrangements and their impact on optoelectronic properties remains elusive. To address this issue, herein three SAMs with representative orientations, i.e., edge&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;1), tilt&#8208;on (4PACz) and face&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;2) are meticulously designed. These orientations have been rigorously validated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations. Remarkably, an unequivocal correlation between the molecular orientation and the device performance is discerned. Particularly, the edge&#8208;on oriented BCZ&#8208;1 exhibits the largest dipole moment normal to the electrode, accompanied by a dense and uniform coverage. These features collectively contribute to its strongest work function increment for ultra&#8208;fast hole extraction and minimum interfacial carrier recombination. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.93% is achieved in devices based on BCZ&#8208;1 with D18:L8&#8208;BO as the active layer, representing one of the highest values reported for binary bulk heterojunction OPVs. Besides, BCZ&#8208;1 shows great potential for practical applications due to its superior up&#8208;scalability and enhanced device shelf&#8208;stability. Overall, this work offers in&#8208;depth insights into the orientation behaviors of SAMs, opening new avenues to unlock the efficiency potential of OPVs.

         <title>Imaging the 4D Chemical Heterogeneity of Single V2O5 Particles During Charging/Discharging Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally&#8208;resolved dual&#8208;mode spinning&#8208;disk confocal microscopy is developed to monitor the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. A unique and irreversible transformation of V5+ to V3+ on a particle's bottom electric contact points has been unveiled for the first time. The coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed to inhibit V3+ precipitation effectively.








Abstract
Microparticle cathode materials are widely used in secondary batteries. However, obtaining dynamic chemical heterogeneities of these microparticles is challenging, hindering in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of the underlying processes. For example, although vanadium pentoxide shows promise as an electrode material for zinc ion batteries, its poor performance's root cause is elusive. Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual&#8208;mode spinning disk confocal microscopy&#8208;based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. Dual&#8208;mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V3+ species at the bottom interface of the V2O5 electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed for inhibiting V3+ precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Proposing Altermagnetic&#8208;Ferroelectric Type&#8208;III Multiferroics with Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiferroics are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Here, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space&#8208; inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin&#8208;ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next&#8208;generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

Reducing heterointerface nonradiative recombination is a key challenge for realizing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Motivated by this, a facile strategy is developed via interfacial energetics reversal to functionalize perovskite heterointerface. A surfactant molecule, trichloro[3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)propyl]silane (TPFS) reverses perovskite surface energetics from intrinsic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type, evidently demonstrated by ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies. The reconstructed perovskite surface energetics match well with the upper deposited hole transport layer, realizing an exquisite energy level alignment for accelerating hole extraction across the heterointerface. Meanwhile, TPFS further diminishes surface defect density. As a result, this cooperative strategy leads to greatly minimized nonradiative recombination. PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.9% with excellent reproducibility, and a nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV, which is the smallest reported to date in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.

         <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;type Ru nanocrystal with co&#8208;crystalline structure possesses an efficient bridge adsorbed hydrogen configuration (*Hbridge) at the Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) interface. The *Hbridge dominates HER and exhibits superior intrinsic activity, &#8776;10.6 times higher than that of Pt. The designed Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) with *Hbridge demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability for both laboratory and industrial levels.








Abstract
Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate (*Hbridge) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc)) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring *Hbridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to *Hbridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8201;&#160;cm&#8722;2) and high turnover frequency (56.4&#8201;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ugPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61&#160;V at 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1000&#160;h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80&#160;&#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58&#160;V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm&#8722;2. This finding highlights the key role of *Hbridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Rings</title>

Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.
