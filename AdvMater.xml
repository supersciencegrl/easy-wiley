         <title>Binary&#8208;Cooperative Ultrathin Porous Membrane for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate framework (g&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles are synthesized by a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, and the resulting defect&#8208;free membranes are obtained via spin&#8208;coating and thermal treatment. The membrane is constructed with g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles and stacked cross&#8208;linking boundaries, which form dual channels with fast gas transport and molecular sieving. The membrane performance is stable under 3.0 MPa.








Abstract
The construction of ultrathin porous membranes with stable structures is critical for achieving efficient gas separation. Inspired by the binary&#8208;cooperative structural features of bones and teeth&#8212;composed of rigid hydroxyapatite and flexible collagen, which confer excellent mechanical strength&#8212;a binary&#8208;cooperative porous membrane constructed with gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (g&#8208;ZIFs), synthesized using a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, is proposed. The enlarged cavity size and flexible frameworks of the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles significantly improve gas adsorption and diffusion, respectively. After thermal treatment, the coordination structures forming rigid segments in the g&#8208;ZIF membranes appear at the stacked g&#8208;ZIF boundaries, exhibiting a higher Young's modulus than the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles, denoted as the flexible segments. The g&#8208;ZIF membranes demonstrate excellent tensile and compression resistances, attributed to the effective translation of binary&#8208;cooperative effects of rigidity and flexibility into the membranes. The resulting dual&#8208;aperture structure, composed of g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles surrounded by nanoscale apertures at the boundaries, yields a membrane with a stable CO2 permeance of 4834 GPU and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 90 within 3.0&#160;MPa.

         <title>Cascaded Heteroporous Nanocomposites for Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Passive Radiation Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded heteroporous nanocomposite films with multistage optical scattering exhibit excellent subambient radiative cooling performance, achieving an enhanced average emissivity of 96.5% within the atmospheric window and a high reflectivity of 97.3% in the sunlight spectra. Combined with phase transition properties, these films possess thermal dissipation and absorption capabilities, effectively counteracting thermal shocks in device heating systems.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for heat dissipation that does not consume energy. However, current radiative cooling materials can only exhibit subambient cooling under atmospheric conditions and struggle to process specific heat accumulation. Thus, a passive thermal regulation mechanism adapted to wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range applications is required to match device heating systems. Herein, a heteroporous nanocomposite film (HENF) with thermo&#8208;adaptive radiation cooling performance is reported. Compared to conventional porous cooling films with limited scattering efficiencies, the HENFs with multistage scattering have a strong emissivity of 96.5% (8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and a high reflectivity of 97.3% (0.3&#8211;2.5&#160;&#181;m), resulting in an ultrahigh cooling power of 114&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. In such HENFs, theoretical analyses have confirmed the spectrum management superiority of the heteroporous unit in terms of the scattering efficiency strength, with their cascading effect enhancing the overall film&#8208;cooling efficiency. The high mechanical performance, phase&#8208;transition features, and environmental adaptive properties of HENFs are also exhibited. Importantly, HENFs synergistically couple thermal dissipation and absorption to effectively process heat accumulation and counteract thermal shock in heating devices. It is anticipated that thermo&#8208;adaptive HENFs will act as a promising platform for device surface thermal regulation over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Shape Memory Cryogel for Hemorrhage Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the call for eco&#8208;friendly healthcare solutions rises, the novel, energy&#8208;efficient biosafe pollen cryogels answer the call&#8208;crafted without toxic crosslinkers, they offer impressive shape&#8208;memory, strong mechanical resilience, and high biocompatibility. They stand out as a potential medical game&#8208;changer for healing deep, noncompressible wounds.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for sustainable manufacturing, motivated by concerns over energy conservation and carbon footprints, encounters challenges due to insufficient renewable materials and arduous fabrication procedures to fulfill specific requirements in medical and healthcare systems. Here, biosafe pollen cryogel is engineered as effective hemostats without additional harmful crosslinkers to treat deep noncompressible wounds. A straightforward and low&#8208;energy approach is involved in forming stable macroporous cryogel, benefiting from the unique micro&#8208;hierarchical structures and chemical components of non&#8208;allergenic plant pollen. It is demonstrated that the pollen cryogel exhibits rapid water/blood&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory properties within 2 s. Owing to their inherent nano/micro hierarchical structure and abundant chemical functional groups on the pollen surface, the pollen cryogel shows effective hemostatic performance in a mouse liver penetration model, which is easily removed after usage. Overall, the self&#8208;crosslinking pollen cryogel in this work pioneers a framework of potential clinical applications for the first&#8208;hand treatment on deep noncompressible wounds.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free nanowelding between 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductor nanoplates is achieved by perfectly aligning their crystalline orientations using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with the assistance of the anisotropic lubricity between the nanoplates and a graphene substrate.








Abstract
Nanowelding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom&#8208;designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, a new technique is reported based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

A series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (namely Pt/N&#8208;mWO3, Rh/N&#8208;mWO3, Pd/N&#8208;mWO3) are straightforwardly synthesized through a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly strategy. The obtained Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 materials have ordered mesoporous structure with ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles, rich oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces, exhibiting superior ammonia sensing performances with a low limit of detection (51.2 ppb).








Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated ordered mesoporous transition metal oxides remains a great challenge due to the difficulty of balancing the interactions between precursors and templates. Herein, a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly (SPEMC) strategy is developed for straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (abbreviated as NM/N&#8208;mWO3, NM&#160;=&#160;Pt, Rh, Pd). The amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS) copolymers coassemble with ammonium metatungstate (AMT) clusters and different kinds of hydrophilic noble metal precursors without phase separation. SPEMC synthesis requires no direct interaction between PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS and AMT, thus the assembly equilibriums between noble metal precursors and PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS can be readily controlled. The obtained NM/N&#8208;mWO3 nanocomposites possess ordered mesopores, abundant oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces. As a result, the Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensors exhibit superior ammonia sensing performances with high sensitivity, an ultralow limit of detection (51.2 ppb), good selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ammonia is oxidized stepwise to NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; during the sensing process. Moreover, a portable wireless module based on Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensor can recognize ppm&#8208;level concentration of ammonia, which lays a solid foundation for its application in various fields.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Artificial Spider Silk for Luminous Surgical Sutures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, the luminous artificial spider silks are prepared by employing highly hydrated segments and polyhydroxyl segments. Furthermore, a luminescent surgical suture is prepared by coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.








Abstract
The development of functional surgical sutures with excellent mechanical properties, good fluorescence, and high cytocompatibility is highly required in the field of medical surgeries. Achieving fibers that simultaneously exhibit high mechanical robustness, good spinnability, and durable fluorescence emission has remained challenging up to now. Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, this work reports a luminous artificial spider silk prepared with the aim of balancing the fiber spinnability and mechanical robustness. This is realized by employing highly hydrated segments with aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence for enhancing the fiber spinnability and polyhydroxyl segments for increasing the fiber mechanical robustness. Twist insertion during fiber spinning improves the fiber strength, toughness, and fluorescence emission. Furthermore, coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer results in a &#8220;sheath&#8211;core&#8221; architecture with improved mechanical properties and capacity to withstand water. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.

         <title>Extremely Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Unusual Axial Diamagnetism in a Quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall effect is observed in quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5. The obtained anomalous Hall conductivity is the largest one in the current anomalous Hall effect systems. Especially, the absence of magnetic elements makes La3MgBi5 one of the few non&#8208;magnetic materials that can exhibit anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in materials without magnetic elements. Here, a study of La3MgBi5 is presented, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although magnetic elements are absent in La3MgBi5, the signals of AHE can be observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large, reaching 42,356 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8%, the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry curvature. Another unique property discovered in La3MgBi5 is the axial diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of the restricted motion of the Dirac fermion at the Fermi level. These findings not only establish La3MgBi5 as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport but also indicate the great potential of 315&#8208;type Bi&#8208;based materials for exploring novel physical&#160;properties.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS2. Consequently, spin&#8208;dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS2, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.









Abstract
Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin&#8208;locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS2) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiNx) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS2 exciton emission with a spin&#8208;correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS2 exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin&#8208;dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley&#8208;polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Glass States Generated in a van der Waals Magnet by Alkali&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration.

&lt;p&gt;Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin-glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin-orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin-glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy-hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile cryomicroneedle patch (CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for preserving the high activity of HMME and CAT in vitro and improving bioavailability in vivo, which enhances traceable PDT by O2 generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated GSH depletion.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy is further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT can be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveils the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrates distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>All&#8208;Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano&#8208;regions over a large area in SrCoO2.5 thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all&#8208;oxide metasurfaces.








Abstract
Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three&#8208;terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non&#8208;uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices. Designer metasurfaces formed in this way from SrCoO2.5 thin films display an anomalous optical reflection of light that relies on the uniform and coherent response of all the devices. Beyond oxides, almost any material whose properties can be controlled by the addition or removal of ions via gating can form novel metasurfaces using this technique. These findings provide insights into the electrokinetics of ionic gating and a wide range of applications using synchronized local ionic gating.

         <title>Embedding Biomimetic Vascular Networks via Coaxial Sacrificial Writing into Functional Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coaxial sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is used to embed biomimetic vascular networks into densely cellular matrices. These coaxially printed and perfusable hierarchical, branching vessels are composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds endothelialized lumens. Using co&#8208;SWIFT, vascularized cardiac tissues are constructed that exhibit synchronous beating, high contractility, and cardio&#8208;effective drug response.








Abstract
Printing human tissues and organs replete with biomimetic vascular networks is of growing interest. While it is possible to embed perfusable channels within acellular and densely cellular matrices, they do not currently possess the biomimetic architectures found in native vessels. Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle&#8208;laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co&#8208;SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio&#8208;effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ&#8208;specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.

Importantly, it is found that co-SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio-effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ-specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect Breaks the pH Dependence in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;distorted TiOxFy catalyst is developed with a strengthened pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, the microenvironment at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and consequently the absorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, leading to significant pH&#8208;resistant properties for two&#8208;electrode oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of small molecules (like O2 and CO2) often exhibits strong activity dependence on pHs because of discrepant proton donor environments. However, some catalysts can show seldom dependence on two&#8208;electron oxygen electroreduction, a sustainable route of O2 hydrogenation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this work, a pH&#8208;resistant oxygen electroreduction system arising from the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is demonstrated. Thorough operando Raman spectra, local environment analyses and density function theory simulations, the lattice distortion of TiOxFy that introduces the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect contributing to regulating local pHs at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and the absorption/desorption of key *OOH intermediate is revealed. Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiOxFy displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H2O2 yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further techno&#8208;economics analyses display the H2O2 production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.37&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multistate Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual triazatruxene (TAT) molecules forming a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.








Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step toward the realization of novel logic and memory devices. This paper reports on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. The low&#8208;bias switching behavior is explored in active units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules that are purposefully defined (programmed) by high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. Within such a unit the low&#8208;bias switching can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single TAT molecule, demonstrating up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled molecules, respectively. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to bias&#8208;dependent hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.

         <title>Boosting All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells by Revitalizing the Buried Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylcholine acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; aiding in the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly improving the overall quality of the top narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite layers. As a result, single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells and their 2&#8208;terminal tandems achieve stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 22.98% and 27.54%, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) serve as crucial top subcells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the prevalent use of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layers (HTLs) in NBG PSCs compromises device efficiency and stability. To address this, the study proposes a revitalizing strategy for the buried interface of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites by directly immersing acetylcholine chloride (ACh) into PEDOT: PSS. ACh acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; not only modulating the bottom PEDOT: PSS HTLs but also facilitating the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly enhancing the quality of the top perovskite layers. This intervention with ACh prevents Sn2+ oxidation, mitigates buried defects, and encourages the growth of large, densely packed grains within Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, the optimized NBG PSCs exhibit significantly improved hole transport and reduced carrier recombination, achieving a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 22.98% with enhanced stability. Furthermore, these optimized NBG Sn&#8208;Pb cells enable highly efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, boasting steady&#8208;state efficiencies of 27.54% (certified at 26.41%) and 28.01%, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing NBG PSCs through buried interface reconstruction, propelling the advancement of all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Printed All&#8208;Carbon Responsive Material and Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new carbon&#8208;based responsive material that unlocks the unexpectedly high vapor response speed of 9400&#176; s&#8722;1 as well as excellent enviroment tolerance. Based on this, an innovative somersaulting robot with locomotion velocity close to the level of animals is designed and constructed, representing a milestone towards achieving life&#8208;like performance in biomimetic soft robots.








Abstract
Responsive materials and actuators are the basis for the development of various leading&#8208;edge technologies but have so far mostly been designed based on polymers, incurring key limitations related to sensitivity and environmental tolerance. This work reports a new responsive material, laser&#8208;printed carbon film (LPCF), produced via direct laser transformation of a liquid organic precursor and consists of graphitic and amorphous carbons. The high activity of amorphous carbon combined with the dual&#8208;gradient structure enables the LPCF to have a actuation speed of 9400&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1 in response to the stimulus of organic vapor. LPCF exhibits a conductivity of 950&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 and excellent resistance to various extreme environmental conditions, which are unachievable for polymer&#8208;based materials. Additionally, an LPCF&#8208;based all&#8208;carbon soft robot that can mimic the complex continuous backward somersaulting motions without manual intervention is constructed. The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&#8722;1, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life&#8208;like performance.

The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life-like performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>

         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine (III)&#8208;Based Complexation for Chiroptical Supramolecular Glass, Deep Eutectic Solvent and Luminescent Switch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents are achieved by the biaxial type halogen bonded complexation, which also appends light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine(III) have widely been utilized for organic synthetic reagents. They are also recognized as positive charge&#8208;assisted, exceptionally robust biaxial halogen bond donors, while their potential in supramolecular materials is barely explored. This work reports a cyclic diaryliodonium ion as biaxial halogen bonding donor that displays remarkable binding affinity toward phenanthroline or acridine acceptors with chiral pendants. Biaxial halogen bonding enables chiroptical evolution in solution, allowing for rational control over supramolecular chirality. Leveraging their strong binding affinity, the halogen bonding complexes manifested amorphous properties and deep eutectic behavior in the solid state. Capitalizing on these attributes, this work achieves the successful preparation of supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents. Additionally, halogen bonding appended light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Transport in the Injured Kidneys with Elevated Renal Function Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray imaging to track the kidney transport of renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles, the study finds that inner strip of outer medulla is the most significant site in accumulating glomerular filtered nanoparticles in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidney: formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the lumen of the loop of Henle increases as proximal tubular injury progresses, which is undetectable by renal function biomarkers BUN and creatinine in mild injury stages.








Abstract
Renal function biomarkers such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) serve as key indicators for guiding clinical decisions before administering kidney&#8208;excreted small&#8208;molecule agents. With engineered nanoparticles increasingly designed to be renally clearable to expedite their clinical translation, understanding the relationship between renal function biomarkers and nanoparticle transport in diseased kidneys becomes crucial to their biosafety in future clinical applications. In this study, renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as X&#8208;ray contrast agents to noninvasively track their transport and retention in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidneys with varying BUN and Cr levels. The findings reveal that AuNP transport is significantly slowed in the medulla of severely injured kidneys, with BUN and Cr levels elevated to 10 times normal. In mildly injured kidneys, where BUN and Cr levels only four to five times higher than normal, AuNP transport and retention are not predictable by BUN and Cr levels but correlate strongly with the degree of tubular injury due to the formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the Henle's loop of the medulla. These results underscore the need for caution when employing renal&#8208;clearable nanomedicines in compromised kidneys and highlight the potential of renal&#8208;clearable AuNPs as X&#8208;ray probes for&#160;assessing kidney injuries noninvasively.

         <title>Fully 3D&#8208;Printed Miniature Soft Hydraulic Actuators with Shape Memory Effect for Morphing and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving both rich shape morphing and shape locking remains challenging in miniature soft actuators. Fully multi&#8208;material 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect are reported. They can achieve programable fast, versatile 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape morphing, temporary shape locking, and shape recovery for applications in non&#8208;invasive and delicate grasping and energy&#8208;saving manipulators.








Abstract
Miniature shape&#8208;morphing soft actuators driven by external stimuli and fluidic pressure hold great promise in morphing matter and small&#8208;scale soft robotics. However, it remains challenging to achieve both rich shape morphing and shape locking in a fast and controlled way due to the limitations of actuation reversibility and fabrication. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect (SME) for programable fast shape morphing and shape locking, are reported. It combines commercial high&#8208;resolution multi&#8208;material 3D printing of stiff shape memory polymers (SMPs) and soft elastomers and direct printing of microfluidic channels and 2D/3D channel networks embedded in elastomers in a single print run. Leveraging spatial patterning of hybrid compositions and expansion heterogeneity of microfluidic channel networks for versatile hydraulically actuated shape morphing, including circular, wavy, helical, saddle, and warping shapes with various curvatures, are demonstrated. The morphed shapes can be temporarily locked and recover to their original planar forms repeatedly by activating SME of the SMPs. Utilizing the fast shape morphing and locking in the miniature actuators, their potential applications in non&#8208;invasive manipulation of small&#8208;scale objects and fragile living organisms, multimodal entanglement grasping, and energy&#8208;saving manipulators, are demonstrated.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Planar Polymer with Efficient &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer material with a planar imine&#8208;rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra&#8208;stable and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage capability. For real applications, an all&#8208;organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability.

&lt;p&gt;A novel polymer material with a planar imine-rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;-electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra-stable and unrivaled proton-storage capability. For real applications, an all-organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability. Although polymers with tunable molecular structures are ideal electrode materials, their unsatisfactory proton-storage redox behaviors hinder the practical application in APB devices.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomesh Enables Cellular&#8208;Resolution, Elastic Neuroelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results presented here provide multifunctional materials, fabrication, and microsystem strategies establishing foundations for elastic neuroelectronics, where conventional thin&#8208;film&#8208;based electrode materials make stretchable microelectrodes through in&#8208;plane nanomesh structuring, achieving unparalleled scalability down to cellular resolution and reliable elasticity. Detailed in vivo studies suggest the ability of these devices to provide tissue&#8208;conforming, high&#8208;quality interfaces with individual neurons in intact nervous tissues.








Abstract
Silicone&#8208;based devices have the potential to achieve an ideal interface with nervous tissue but suffer from scalability, primarily due to the mechanical mismatch between established electronic materials and soft elastomer substrates. This study presents a novel approach using conventional electrode materials through multifunctional nanomesh to achieve reliable elastic microelectrodes directly on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone with an unprecedented cellular resolution. This engineered nanomesh features an in&#8208;plane nanoscale mesh pattern, physically embodied by a stack of three thin&#8208;film materials by design, namely Parylene&#8208;C for mechanical buffering, gold (Au) for electrical conduction, and Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for improved electrochemical interfacing. Nanomesh elastic neuroelectronics are validated using single&#8208;unit recording from the small and curvilinear epidural surface of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with device self&#8208;conformed and superior recording quality compared to plastic control devices requiring manual pressing is demonstrated. Electrode scaling studies from in vivo epidural recording further revealed the need for cellular resolution for high&#8208;fidelity recording of single&#8208;unit activities and compound action potentials. In addition to creating a minimally invasive device to effectively interface with DRG sensory afferents at a single&#8208;cell resolution, this study establishes nanomeshing as a practical pathway to leverage traditional electrode materials for a new class of elastic neuroelectronics.

         <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile approach is fully compatible with the lithography processes to create an atomically connected interface and effectively modulate the band alignment at the interface. This method is also generic for other materials and will ultimately result in the desirable requirements for topological and Andreev devices.








Abstract
Hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the integration of the properties of both materials, which relies on the interface details and the resulting coupling strength and wavefunction hybridization. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of the band alignment of the interface, as well as its tunability to the coupling and hybridization. Here, the interface is modified by inducing specific argon milling while maintaining its high quality, e.g., atomic connection, which results in a large induced superconducting gap and ballistic transport. By comparing with Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson calculations, it is proven that this method can vary the band bending/coupling strength and the electronic spatial distribution. In the strong coupling regime, the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co&#8208;tunneling&#8212;key ingredients for the Kitaev chain&#8212;are confirmed. This method is also generic for other materials and achieves a hard and huge superconducting gap in lead and indium antimonide nanowire (Pb&#8208;InSb) devices. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well&#8208;controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low&#8208;Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces vacancy&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H2 production efficiency under low&#8208;frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post&#8208;light absorption, significantly boosting H2 production.








Abstract
This study investigates the impact of In&#8208; and S&#8208;vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non&#8208;centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low&#8208;frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well&#8208;dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual&#8208;vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H2 evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge&#8208;separation efficiency, through multi&#8208;scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine&#8208;learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.

The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge-separation efficiency, through multi-scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine-learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Defect Modification Through Oily&#8208;Allicin Modified Buried Interface Achieving Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oily Allicin is introduced into perovskite solar cells to achieve grain wrapping under different stressors, which promotes defect contact and prevents ionic migration. A power conversion efficiency of 25.07% with an FF (fill factor) of 84.03% is achieved, which reaches 93.16% of the FF S&#8211;Q limit.








Abstract
The buried interface properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. The metal&#8208;oxide/perovskite heterogeneous interfaces are highly defective and cause serious ion migration. However, the buried and unexposed bottom interface and simultaneous stabilization of grain boundaries receive less attention and effective solutions. To tackle this problem, a solid&#8211;liquid strategy is employed by introducing oily&#8208;additive allicin at the buried interface to passivate the shallow (VI and Vo) and deep traps (VPb and PbI). Interestingly, oily status allicin fills the pinholes at the heterointerface and wraps the perovskite grains, suppressing the ion migration during the photoaging process. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 25.07% is achieved with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 84.03%. The modified devices can maintain 94.51% of the original PCE after light soaking under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1000&#160;h. This work demonstrates a buried interface modification method that employs an eco&#8208;friendly additive, which helps promote the development of PSCs with high performance and stability.

         <title>Embedded Skyrmion Bags in Thin Films of Chiral Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first experimental observations of magnetic skyrmion bags embedded within skyrmion lattices in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe. By utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of embedded skyrmion bags, which remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields, is observed directly. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle&#8208;like properties. Earlier research has mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = &#8722;1. However, theoretical analyses of 2D chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags&#8212;solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe is shown. In particular, it is shown that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. The results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic&#160;solitons.

         <title>Automated Synthesis of DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the first automated, solid&#8208;phase synthesis of DNA nanomaterials is presented, achieved via the prototype DNA nanoassembler system. This methodology enables the production of sequence&#8208;controlled custom DNA nanotubes through self&#8208;assembly. Combining single&#8208;molecule kinetics and photobleaching experiments, microfluidic assembly, and automated data screening, the construction strategy relies on the sequential hybridization of DNA modules at room temperature onto a solid support.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized the ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA&#8208;based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, a fully automated method is reported to produce sequence&#8208; and size&#8208;defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX&#8208;tile&#8208;based DNA nanotubes and flexible wireframe DNA structures are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self&#8208;assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self&#8208;assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (through an ad&#8208;hoc developed K&#8208;means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single&#8208;molecule &#8220;assembly&#8208;analysis&#8208;optimization&#8221; sequence can be used to generate complex, noncovalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach is presented using catalysis units, simplifying material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to an assembly&#8208;like process. Through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML), a structure&#8208;performance relationship is established. Integration catalysis units into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrates Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work proposes a streamlined strategy, potentially integrating DFT, ML, and experimental section for efficient functional materials development.








Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of material candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units, is proposed and validated. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. First, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on a series of potential catalysis units that are possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) is employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterward, the projected catalysis units are integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirming that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for the design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

Forming molecular bridges between water&#8208;soluble polymer chains widens chain distances leading to the reduced conductivity of lithium cations. This controlled migration of ions delivers pronounced hysteresis characteristics in organic transistors, which can mimic the action of biological synapses. The present organic synaptic transistors with the controlled ion migration layers can proceed with neural computing processes at an accuracy of 96%.








Abstract
Synaptic transistors require sufficient retention (memory) performances of current signals to exactly mimic biological synapses. Ion migration has been proposed to achieve high retention characteristics but less attention has been paid to polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs). Here, OSTRs with water&#8208;processable polymer&#8208;based SSEs, featuring ion migration&#8208;controllable molecular bridges, which are prepared by reactions of poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) are demonstrated. The ion conductivity of PSSA:LiOH:DETA (1:0.4:X, PLiD) films is remarkably changed by the molar ratio (X) of DETA, which is attributed to the extended distances between the PSSA chains by the DETA bridges. The devices with the PLiD layers deliver noticeably changed hysteresis reaching an optimum at X = 0.2, leading to the longest retention of current signals upon single/double pulses. The long&#8208;term potentiation test confirms that the present OSTRs can gradually build up the postsynaptic current by gate pulses of &#8722;2&#160;V, while the long&#8208;term depression can be adjusted by varying the depression gate pulses (&#8776;0.2&#8211;1.2&#160;V). The artificial neural network simulations disclose that the present OSTRs with the ion migration&#8208;controlled PLiD layers can perform synaptic processes with an accuracy of &#8776;96%.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Carrier&#8208;Dominant Transport in 2D Single&#8208;Crystal Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic nature of transport is presented by hole carriers in 2D copper without grain boundaries. Twin boundaries almost do not scatter electrons. The hidden hole&#8208;like properties of 2D copper can only be unmasked by thorough removal of grain boundaries. The existence of hole carriers is revealed in 2D copper through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and nonlinear Hall effect measurements.








Abstract
In 2D noble metals like copper, the carrier scattering at grain boundaries has obscured the intrinsic nature of electronic transport. However, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic nature of transport by hole carriers in 2D copper can be revealed by growing thin films without grain boundaries. As even a slight deviation from the twin boundary is perceived as grain boundaries by electrons, it is only through the thorough elimination of grain boundaries that the hidden hole&#8208;like attribute of 2D single&#8208;crystal copper can be unmasked. Two types of Fermi surfaces, a large hexagonal Fermi surface centered at the zone center and the triangular Fermi surface around the zone corner, tightly matching to the calculated Fermi surface topology, confirmed by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and vivid nonlinear Hall effects of the 2D single&#8208;crystal copper account for the presence of hole carriers experimentally. This breakthrough suggests the potential to manipulate the majority carrier polarity in metals by means of grain boundary engineering in a 2D geometry.

         <title>Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near&#8208;room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr3.








Abstract
CsPbBr3 exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large&#8208;area ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr3 in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy. This work paves the way for utilizing ferroelectric CsPbBr3 in novel optoelectronic devices, significantly expanding the potential of this material and opening doors for further exploration in this exciting field.

         <title>Memristive Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Probabilistic Graph Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) using Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors. C&#8208;PGM expresses uncertainties in graph data through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations, enabling fast processing and large&#8208;scale implementation of probabilistic units. This model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy in applications like steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm compared to conventional methods.








Abstract
Modern graph datasets with structural complexity and uncertainties due to incomplete information or data variability require advanced modeling techniques beyond conventional graph models. This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) utilizing Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors, which exhibit probabilistic switching, self&#8208;rectifying, and memory characteristics. C&#8208;PGM addresses the complexities and uncertainties inherent in structural graph data across various domains, leveraging the probabilistic nature of memristors. C&#8208;PGM relies on the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation across multiple memristive CBAs, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that rely on sequential operations, which are slower and have a reliability concern due to repeated switching. This new approach enables the fast processing and massive implementation of probabilistic units at the expense of chip area. In this study, the hardware&#8208;based C&#8208;PGM feasibly expresses small&#8208;scale probabilistic graphs and shows minimal error in aggregate probability calculations. The probability calculation capabilities of C&#8208;PGM are applied to steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm, which is implemented on a simulated large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PGM. The C&#8208;PGM&#8208;based steady&#8208;state estimation and PageRank algorithm demonstrate comparable accuracy to conventional methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno&#8208;Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno&#8208;free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell&#8208;adhesive properties as well as non&#8208;cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long&#8208;term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno&#8208;free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell&#8208;based therapies.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno-free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate-grafting-guanidine-co-carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost-competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell-based therapies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno-free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno-free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate-grafting-guanidine-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell-adhesive properties as well as non-cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost-competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long-term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno-free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Analgesia Blocks Cancer&#8208;Induced Bone Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This polyvinylpyrrolidone modified Aurivillius structure BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs) are synthesized via a hydrothermal process. Ultrasound can trigger BIONSs to generate local electrical field, internalizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) rapidly and substantially decreasing the expression of TRPV1. With the reduction of TRPV1, the Ca2+ signal in spinal neuron is obviously decreased and the activity of wide range dynamic neurons is inhibited, accompanying the reduction of some neuropeptides and the change of inflammatory cytokines, resulting cancer induced bone pain relief for up to 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The manipulation of cell surface receptors&#8217; activity will open a new frontier for drug development and disease treatment. However, limited by the desensitization of drugs, effective physical intervention strategy remains challenging. Here, the controllable internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on neural cells by local piezoelectric field is reported. Single&#8208;cell&#8208;level local electric field is construct by synthesizing piezoelectric BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs). Upon a mild ultrasound of 0.08&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, an electric field of 15.29&#160;&#181;V is generated on the surface of BIONSs, further inducing TRPV1 internalization in 5&#160;min. The as&#8208;downregulated TRPV1 expression results in the reduction of Ca2+ signal in a spinal neuron and the inhibition of the activity of wide range dynamic neurons, therefore effectively preventing the transmission of cancer&#8208;induced bone pain (CIBP). This strategy not only charts a new course for CIBP alleviation, but also introduces a promising nanotechnology for regulating cell surface receptors, showing significant potential in neuropathological and receptor&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Needle&#8208;Like Multifunctional Biphasic Microfiber for Minimally Invasive Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needle&#8208;like stretchable multifunctional microfiber for minimally invasive bioelectronics is developed, featuring a liquid metal core&#8208;nanocomposite shell structure. This design allows stiffness control based on phase transition and offers advantageous properties of both materials such as softness, stretchability, conductivity, and strain&#8208;insensitivity. Further functionalization enhances its biosensing and stimulation capabilities, showing promise for clinical translation across various in vivo applications.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics has attracted significant attention in electroceuticals and clinical medicine for precise diagnosis and efficient treatment of target diseases. However, conventional rigid implantable devices face challenges such as poor tissue&#8208;device interface and unavoidable tissue damage during surgical implantation. Despite continuous efforts to utilize various soft materials to address such issues, their practical applications remain limited. Here, a needle&#8208;like stretchable microfiber composed of a phase&#8208;convertible liquid metal (LM) core and a multifunctional nanocomposite shell for minimally invasive soft bioelectronics is reported. The sharp tapered microfiber can be stiffened by freezing akin to a conventional needle to penetrate soft tissue with minimal incision. Once implanted in vivo where the LM melts, unlike conventional stiff needles, it regains soft mechanical properties, which facilitate a seamless tissue&#8208;device interface. The nanocomposite incorporating with functional nanomaterials exhibits both low impedance and the ability to detect physiological pH, providing biosensing and stimulation capabilities. The fluidic LM embedded in the nanocomposite shell enables high stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitive electrical properties. This multifunctional biphasic microfiber conforms to the surfaces of the stomach, muscle, and heart, offering a promising approach for electrophysiological recording, pH sensing, electrical stimulation, and radiofrequency ablation in vivo.

         <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Preferential Liquid Transport through the Intrinsic Pores of Cyclodextrin in Polyester Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl chloride crosslinked macrocyclic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyester nanofilm composite membranes result in membranes with high water permeance and superior ion&#8208;sieving capabilities. Polar aggregate pores in the nanofilm facilitate water permeation while the intrinsic cyclodextrin cavity does not contribute to liquid permeation, enabling selective permeation of polar liquids with extremely high permeance selectivity of &gt;500 and diminishes the existence of Janus pathways.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;&#8208;CD, demonstrating remarkable Na2SO4 rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), extremely low hexane permeance (&lt;1 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non&#8208;polar liquids flow through the &#946;&#8208;CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Graphitization: The First Observation of Homogeneous Solid&#8208;State Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic graphitization is a simple and flexible route to graphitic carbons from biomass or organic precursors. Here, it is shown that the mechanism of graphitization involves a new type of catalysis where all components are in the solid state. This has broad implications in the important world of carbon but also more widely in materials science.








Abstract
Carbon is a critical material for existing and emerging energy applications and there is considerable global effort in generating sustainable carbons. A particularly promising area is iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization, which is the conversion of organic matter to graphitic carbon nanostructures by an iron catalyst. In this paper, it is reported that iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization occurs via a new type of mechanism that is called homogeneous solid&#8208;state catalysis. Dark field in situ transmission electron microscopy is used to demonstrate that crystalline iron nanoparticles &#8220;burrow&#8221; through amorphous carbon to generate multiwalled graphitic nanotubes. The process is remarkably fast, particularly given the solid phase of the catalyst, and in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to demonstrate that graphitization is complete within a few minutes.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates for the first time the efficient generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy. This work quantifies the transport properties of the orbital currents from CoPt alloy and show that the performance of orbitronic terahertz emitters exceeds the spintronic counterpart. This work provides a new route for the developing orbitronic information devices.








Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, this work confirms that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital-to-charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light-induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters.

         <title>Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Local High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility issue of acetonitrile (AN) with lithium metal is tackled by introducing a novel approach&#8212;a locally high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent (LAT&#8208;0.5:1:2). The electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, flame retardancy, and wettability. Based on Cryo&#8208;EM characterization and theoretical simulations, the underlying mechanism of the AN&#8208;based LHCE from both the respects of solvation and SEI structures has been revealed.








Abstract
Acetonitrile (AN) is a compelling electrolyte solvent for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging batteries, but its reductive instability makes it incompatible with lithium metal anodes (LMAs). Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) is used as the diluent to build an AN&#8208;based local high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to realize dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable LMAs. Such LHCE exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability window close to 6&#160;V (vs Li+/Li), excellent wettability, and promising flame retardancy. Compared to a baseline carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, its electrochemical performance is prominent: the overpotential of lithium nucleation is minimal (only 24&#160;mV), the average half&#8208;cell coulombic efficiency (CE) reaches 99.5% at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and its practicality in full cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes is also demonstrated. Compounding factors are identified to decipher the superiority of the AN&#8208;based LHCE. From the respect of solvation structures, both the elimination of free AN molecule and the diluent separation would contribute to prevention of anodic AN decomposition. Based on cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) characterization and theoretical simulations results, the produced solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is uniform and compact. Thus, this work demonstrates a successful application of AN&#8208;based electrolytes in LMAs&#8212;traditionally deemed impractical&#8212;via the combined regulation of solvation and SEI structures.

         <title>Realization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Intrinsic Polar Metal in a Buckled Honeycomb Binary Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckled AB honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry belongs to polar space group P3m1, is proposed to be a promising candidate hosting topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity. Here, the successful realization of a IV&#8208;V binary compound on Ag (111) surface via molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. Strikingly, polarity and metallicity are found to coexist in the 2D buckled SiP monolayer.








Abstract
Structural topology and symmetry of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network play pivotal roles in defining its electrical properties and functionalities. Here, a binary buckled honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry, which naturally hosts topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity, is proposed. It is successfully achieved in a group IV&#8208;V compound, namely monolayer SiP epitaxially grown on Ag(111) surface. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the degeneration of the Dirac nodal lines to points due to the broken horizonal mirror symmetry is elucidated. More interesting, the SiP monolayer manifests metallic nature, which is mutually exclusive with polarity in conventional materials. It is further found that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity is strongly suppressed by the metallic substrate. This study not only represents a breakthrough of realizing intrinsic polarity in 2D metallic material via ingenious design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay of many exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phenomena.

         <title>Rational Design of Color&#8208;Pure Blue Organic Emitters by Poly&#8208;Heteroaromatic Omni&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;pure blue emitters are in great demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light emitting diodes displays. Here, a simple and clear concept to design such emitters is presented. The application of this concept allows to derive a new structural motif, which is used to synthesize novel color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant blue hue.









Abstract
Current research on organic light emitters which utilize multiple resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF)&#160;materials is gaining significant interest because of the materials&#8217; ability to efficiently generate color&#8208;pure blue emission. However, the underlying reasons for high color purity remain unclear. It is shown here that these emitters share a common electronic basis, which is deduced from resonance structure considerations following Clar's rule, and which is termed as &#8220;poly&#8208;heteroaromatic omni&#8208;delocalization&#8221; (PHOD). The simple and clear design rules derived from the PHOD concept allow extending the known chemical space by new structural motifs. Based on PHOD, a set of novel high&#8208;efficiency color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant deep&#8208;blue hue is specifically designed.

Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Shell&#8208;Less Indium Phosphide Quantum Dots Enabled by Atomistically Tailored Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP quantum dots demonstrate enhanced luminescence through atomic&#8208;level surface manipulation without shell structures. Concerns persist over core instability due to oxidation propensity and inevitable trap presence. However, utilizing Zn&#8208;oleate removes some traps, and with the addition of GaCl3, most traps are eliminated, achieving over 90% luminescence efficiency with the core alone.








Abstract
Contrary to the prevailing notion that shell structures arise from the intricate chemistry and surface defects of InP quantum dots (QDs), an innovative strategy that remarkably enhances the luminescence efficiency of core&#8208;only InP QDs to over 90% is introduced. This paradigm shift is achieved through the concurrent utilization of group 2 and 3 metal&#8208;derived ligands, providing an effective remedy for surface defects and facilitating charge recombination. Specifically, a combination of Zn carboxylate and Ga chloride is employed to address the undercoordination issues associated with In and P atoms, leading to the alleviation of in&#8208;gap trap states. The intricate interplay and proportional ratio between Ga&#8208; and Zn&#8208;containing ligands play pivotal roles in attaining record&#8208;high luminescence efficiency in core&#8208;only InP QDs, as successfully demonstrated across various sizes and color emissions. Moreover, the fabrication of electroluminescent devices relying solely on InP core emission opens a new direction in optoelectronics, demonstrating the potential of the approach not only in optoelectronic applications but also in catalysis or energy conversion by charge transfer.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

         <title>Designed Spin&#8208;Texture&#8208;Lattice to Control Anisotropic Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through control of thin&#8208;film boundary conditions, the magnetic texture present in antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 can be stabilized as a quasi&#8208;1D periodic lattice. This has important implications on spin&#8208;wave transport in the system, which is observed in this work through nitrogen&#8208;vacancy magnetometry imaging, nonlocal transport measurements, and a combination of finite&#8208;element and analytical calculations of the magnon dispersion.








Abstract
Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for future computing technologies due to their ultra&#8208;low energy dissipation and long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities. Multiferroic antiferromagnets, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), have an additional degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with the electric field. Unfortunately, spin&#8208;wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, long&#8208;range spin transport is explored within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable, 1D magnonic crystal. A striking anisotropy is discovered in the spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale theory and simulation suggest that this preferential magnon conduction emerges from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to electrically reconfigurable magnonic crystals in&#160;antiferromagnets.

         <title>Constructing Slip Stacking Diversity in Van der Waals Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings with angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies are constructed in low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals homobilayers via direct growth. Modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment are developed. The work unveils a unique epitaxy and offers a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.








Abstract
The van der Waals (vdW) interface provides two important degrees of freedom&#8212;twist and slip&#8212;to tune interlayer structures and inspire unique physics. However, constructing diversified high&#8208;quality slip stackings (i.e., lattice orientations between layers are parallel with only interlayer sliding) is more challenging than twisted stackings due to angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies between different slip stackings, sparsity of thermodynamically stable candidates and insufficient mechanism understanding. Here, using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers as a model system, this work theoretically elucidates that vdW materials with low lattice symmetry and weak interlayer coupling allow the creation of multifarious thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings, and experimentally achieves&#160;13 and 9 slip stackings in 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReS2 and 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReSe2 bilayers via direct growth, which are systematically revealed by atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), angle&#8208;resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. This work also develops modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries (GBs) and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a prominent dependence of the pressure&#8208;induced electronic band structure transition on stacking configurations. These studies unveil a unique vdW epitaxy and offer a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.

Self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is reported to improve the level of vehicle&#8208;road collaborative perception and autonomous driving cars. With the assistance of artificial intelligence models, SVRIE enhances the ability to recognize vehicle motion, road surface, and tire health condition, with a perception accuracy of more than 90%.








Abstract
Collaborative perception between a vehicle and the road has the potential to enhance the limited perception capability of autonomous driving technologies. With this background, self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is designed to play a dual role, including a SVRIE device integrated into vehicle tires and a SVRIE array embedded into a road surface. The pressure sensing capability and anti&#8208;crosstalk performance of the SVRIE array are characterized separately to validate the feasibility of applying the SVRIE in a cooperative vehicle&#8208;infrastructure system. It is demonstrated that the SVRIE based on the multi&#8208;layered fractal structure exhibits maximum performance in collaborative sensing and interaction between vehicles and road information, such as vehicle motion, road surface condition, and tire life cycle health monitoring. Traditional data analysis methods are often of questionable accuracy. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is used to classify the vehicle and road conditions with accuracy of at least 88.3%. The transfer learning model is constructed to enhance the road surface identification capabilities with 100% accuracy. The accuracies of the vehicle tire motion recognition and tire health monitoring are 97% and 99%, respectively. This work provides new ideas for collaborative perception between vehicles and roadsides.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Energy Loss and Volatilization of Formamidinium via Polymer&#8208;Assisted D&#8211;A supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Interface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.78% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;assisted 5FTPP/PCBM supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interface self&#8208;assembly strategy can minimize interfacial energy losses by addressing thermalization, conduction band offset, and nonradiative recombination, while inhibiting the adverse effect of FA+ volatilization under thermal stress by multidentate anchoring.








Abstract
2D perovskite passivation strategies effectively reduce defect&#8208;assisted carrier nonradiative recombination losses on the perovskite surface. Nonetheless, severe energy losses are causing by carrier thermalization, interfacial nonradiative recombination, and conduction band offset still persist at heterojunction perovskite/PCBM interfaces, which limits further performance enhancement of inverted heterojunction PSCs. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (5FTPP) is introduced between 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction and PCBM. Compared to tetraphenylporphyrin without electron&#8208;withdrawing fluoro&#8208;substituents, 5FTPP can self&#8208;assemble with PCBM at interface into donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) complex with stronger supramolecular interaction and lower energy transfer losses. This rapid energy transfer from donor (5FTPP) to acceptor (PCBM) within femtosecond scale is demonstrated to enlarge hot carrier extraction rates and ranges, reducing thermalization losses. Furthermore, the incorporation of polystyrene derivative (PD) reinforces D&#8211;A interaction by inhibiting self&#8208;&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of 5FTPP, while fine&#8208;tuning conduction band offset and suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination via Schottky barrier, dipole, and n&#8208;doping. Notably, the multidentate anchoring of PD&#8208;5FTPP with FA+, Pb2+, and I&#8722; mitigates the adverse effects of FA+ volatilization during thermal stress. Ultimately, devices with PD&#8208;5FTPP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.78% (certified: 25.36%), maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (65&#160;&#176;C) under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Design of Highly Conductive Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive anion exchange membrane (AEM) structures are identified from a pool of 180000 AEM variations through a trained fully connected neural network (FCNN) model. Under the guidance of machine learning, synthesized AEMs with anilinium cation domain facilitate the formation of continuous ion channels, showing potential applications in AEM&#8208;based energy devices.








Abstract
Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are vital for enabling the efficient and large&#8208;scale utilization of hydrogen energy. However, the performance of such energy devices is impeded by the relatively low conductivity of AEMs. The conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach to designing membrane structures has proven to be both inefficient and costly. To address this challenge, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model is developed based on acid&#8208;catalyzed AEMs to analyze the relationship between structure and conductivity among 180,000 AEM variations. Under machine learning guidance, anilinium cation&#8208;type membranes are designed and synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations and Mulliken charge population analysis validated that the presence of a large anilinium cation domain is a result of the inductive effect of N+ and benzene rings. The interconnected anilinium cation domains facilitated the formation of a continuous ion transport channel within the AEMs. Additionally, the incorporation of the benzyl electron&#8208;withdrawing group heightened the inductive effect, leading to high conductivity AEM variant as screened by the machine learning model. Furthermore, based on the highly active and low&#8208;cost monomers given by machine learning, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of anilinium&#8208;based AEMs confirms the potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an attempt is made to unveil the in situ evolution of Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs by using carbon nanofibers modified with CoOx as Li anode host, and 18O isotope tracing provides firm evidence of oxygen migration from CoOx to Li2O besides electrolyte decomposition. The as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly help improve the anode performance in half, symmetrical, and full cells.








Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which can show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and nonuniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) are successfully prepared as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, the role of CoOx during SEI evolution is elucidated, revealing that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore, the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode can exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Lanthanide Metallopolymer: Self&#8208;Healing and Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence for Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photosensitive photoluminescent metallopolymers with good mechanical properties and fast self&#8208;healing behaviors are successfully developed by incorporating spiropyran and terpyridine components into a unified lanthanide polymer structure. By adjusting the proportions of raw material, precise control over the stimulus response and luminescent color can be achieved. The obtained polymers have been applied for dynamic information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing, and Light&#8208;writing fields.








Abstract
Photoluminescent metallopolymers displaying photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are emerging as promising materials with versatile applications in photo&#8208;rewritable patterns, wearable UV sensors, and optical encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, integrating these materials into practical applications that require fast response times, lightweight qualities, fatigue resistance, and multiple encryption capabilities poses challenges. In this study, luminescent photochromic lanthanide (Ln) metallopolymers with rapid self&#8208;healing properties are developed by cross&#8208;linking terpyridine (Tpy)&#8208; and spiropyran (SP)&#8208; functionalized polyurethane chains through Ln&#8208;Tpy coordination bonds and H&#8208;bonds among polymer chains. The resulting products exhibit a range of intriguing features: i) photo&#8208;stimuli responsiveness using spiropyran monomers without additional dopants; ii) dual&#8208;emitting performance under UV&#8208;light due to Ln&#8208;Tpy and open&#8208;ring spiropyran moieties; iii) satisfactory mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing abilities from polymer chains; iv) multiple control switches for luminescence colors through photostimulation or feed ratio adjustments. Leveraging these attributes, the developed material introduces novel opportunities for light&#8208;writing applications, advanced information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing wearable devices, and insights into designing multifunctional intelligent materials for the future.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of nanoprobes for colorectal cancer imaging agents is carried out by developing Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT with a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (up to 12.3) and fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying), thus enabling successful recognition of the tumor boundary. This work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy in image&#8208;guided tumor resection.









Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometime suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, this work has designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

         <dc:description>
A novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded it into an F&#8208;2DP system by simple air&#8211;liquid interface method to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces between the interlayer and regulate the charge transfer along the intralayer to induce multilevel memory behavior for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing 2D polymer (F&#8208;2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F&#8208;2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces. The donor&#8211;accepter&#8211;accepter&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8242; (D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8242;) structure regulates the charge transportation efficiently, inducing multilevel memory behavior through stepwise charge capture and transfer processes. Thus, the device exhibits ternary memory behavior with low threshold voltage (Vth1 of 1.1&#160;V, Vth2 of 2.0&#160;V), clearly distinguishable resistance states (1:102:104) and ternary yield (83%). Furthermore, the stepwise formation of the charge complex endows the device with a wider range to regulate the conductive state, which allows its application in brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology recognition can reach an accuracy of 86%, showing great potential in neuromorphic computing applications in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>Positively Charged Hollow Co Nanoshells by Kirkendall Effect Stabilized by Electron Sink for Alkaline Water Dissociation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow cobalt&#160;(Co) nanoshells are formed via the Kirkendall effect and stabilized by conductive MoO2 pillars and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. The Co particles are positively charged on the surface which accelerates&#160;the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process.








Abstract
While cobalt (Co) exhibits a comparable energy barrier for H* adsorption/desorption to platinum in theory, it is generally not suitable for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of unfavorable water dissociation. Here, the Kirkendall effect is adopted to fabricate positive&#8208;charged hollow metal Co (PHCo) nanoshells that are stabilized by MoO2 and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. Compared to the zero&#8208;valent Co, the PHCo accelerates the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process. Alkaline HER occurs with a low overpotential of 59.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and first principles calculations reveal that the interfacial water to the PHCo sites and the accelerated proton transfer are conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, the upshifted d&#8208;band center of PHCo optimizes the adsorption/desorption of H*. This work provides a unique synthesis of hollow Co nanoshells via the Kirkendall effect and insights to water dissociation on catalyst surfaces with tailored charge states.

         <title>Unveiling Gating Behavior in Piezoionic Effect: toward Neuromimetic Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoionic hydrogels hold the potential to enable direct ionic gating of transistors. This research reveals that these hydrogels can exhibit gating behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, an analog to the mechanically gated phenomena observed in biological neurons. This breakthrough not only advances neuromimetic pressure sensors but also enhances fundamental understanding of the piezoionic mechanism.








Abstract
The human perception system's information processing is intricately linked to the nonlinear response and gating effect of neurons. While piezoionics holds potential in emulating the pressure sensing capability of biological skin, the incorporation of information processing functions seems neglected. Here, ionic gating behavior in piezoionic hydrogels is uncovered as a notable extension beyond the previously observed linear responses. The hydrogel can generate remarkably high voltages (700&#160;mV) and currents (7&#160;mA) when indentation forces surpass the threshold. Through a comprehensive analysis involving simulations and experimental investigations, it is proposed that the gating behavior emerges due to significant diffusion differences between cations and anions. To showcase the practical implications of this breakthrough, the piezoionic hydrogels are successfully integrated with prostheses and robot hands, demonstrating that the gating effect enables accurate discrimination between gentle and harsh touch. The advancement in neuromimetic tactile sensing has significant potential for emerging applications such as humanoid robotics and biomedical engineering, offering valuable opportunities for further development of embodied neuromorphic intelligence.

         <title>Breaking the Saturation of Sensitivity for Ultrawide Range Flexible Pressure Sensors by Soft&#8208;Strain Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain&#8208;effect&#8208;based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1).








Abstract
The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade&#8208;off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity. Ascribed to the strain effect of sensing layers induced by interlaced microdomes, the sensors possess an increased sensitivity (5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1) over an ultrawide pressure range (45 Pa&#8211;4.1 MPa), a high&#8208;pressure resolution (5 Pa), fast response/recovery time (30/45 ms), and a robust response under a high&#8208;pressure loading of 3.5 MPa for more than 5000 cycles. These superior sensing performances allow the sensor to monitor large pressure. The flexible pressure sensor array can assist doctors in restoring the neutral mechanical axis, tracking knee flexion angles, and extracting gait features. Moreover, the flexible sensing array can be integrated into the joint motion surveillance system to map the balance medial&#8211;lateral contact forces on the metal compartments in real time, demonstrating the potential for further development into precise medical human&#8211;machine interfaces during total knee replacement surgery.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightly cross&#8208;linked alkyl acrylates can function as thermochromic materials with ultrahigh transparency and solar&#8208;modulating abilities via a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous polymer transition. When used as greenhouse materials or coupled with thermoelectric devices, the thermochromic layer is able to function as a thermal valve.








Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy&#8208;efficient windows being one of the primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>A Universal Biocompatible and Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte in p&#8208;Type and n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Complementary Circuits and Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.








Abstract
The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte, compatible with both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT&#8208;based complementary inverter with a record&#8208;high normalized&#8208;gain of 228 V&#8722;1 and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power&#8208;efficient implants.

         <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired material design method is presented to imitate the irregular structure of biological materials and obtain their outstanding mechanical properties. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, the method identifies distributions of fundamental building blocks and connectivity rules and generates synthetic equivalents with the same distributions. The method is demonstrated using the orange pericarp, known for protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities.








Abstract
As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical performances, like high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and good energy absorption. However, reproducing these irregular biological structures in synthetic materials remains a complex design and fabrication challenge. Here, a bioinspired material design method is presented that characterizes the irregular structure as a network of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, synthetic materials are generated with the same distributions of tiles and connectivity rules as the biological material and it is shown that these equivalent materials have structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships similar to the biological ones. To demonstrate the method, the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities is studied. Polymer samples are generated and characterized under quasistatic and dynamic compression and display spatially&#8208;varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, it is also determined how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

         <title>Manipulating Alkyl Inner Side Chain of Acceptor for Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the alkyl inner side chain of the small molecule acceptors assists in regulating molecular bandgap, energy levels, and intermolecular interaction, which is conducive to optimizing the trade&#8208;off among short&#8208;circuit current density, open&#8208;circuit voltage, and fill factor. Consequently, the optimal as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver top&#8208;ranked efficiencies of over 18%.








Abstract
As&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) possess tremendous potential for low&#8208;cost commercial applications. Herein, five small&#8208;molecule acceptors (A1&#8211;A5) are designed and synthesized by selectively and elaborately extending the alkyl inner side chain flanking on the pyrrole motif to prepare efficient as&#8208;cast devices. As the extension of the alkyl chain, the absorption spectra of the films are gradually blue&#8208;shifted from A1 to A5 along with slightly uplifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, which is conducive for optimizing the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuit current density and open&#8208;circuit voltage of the devices. Moreover, a longer alkyl chain improves compatibility between the acceptor and donor. The in situ technique clarifies that good compatibility will prolong molecular assembly time and assist in the preferential formation of the donor phase, where the acceptor precipitates in the framework formed by the donor. The corresponding film&#8208;formation dynamics facilitate the realization of favorable film morphology with a suitable fibrillar structure, molecular stacking, and vertical phase separation, resulting in an incremental fill factor from A1 to A5&#8208;based devices. Consequently, the A3&#8208;based as&#8208;cast OSCs achieve a top&#8208;ranked efficiency of 18.29%. This work proposes an ingenious strategy to manipulate intermolecular interactions and control the film&#8208;formation process for constructing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;cast devices.

         <dc:description>
New monomers capable of frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization are identified through computational screening of thermostability and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization exotherms. Subsequent experimental validation of physical properties of monomers, kinetics, and material properties reveal frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization viability and promise in enabling energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing of 3D printed structures and gradient materials.








Abstract
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) presents an energy&#8208;efficient approach to produce high&#8208;performance polymers, typically utilizing norbornene derivatives from Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. This study broadens the monomer repertoire for FROMP, incorporating the cycloaddition product of biosourced furan compounds and benzyne, namely 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (HEN) derivatives. A computational screening of Diels&#8211;Alder products is conducted, selecting products with resistance to retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder but also sufficient ring strain to facilitate FROMP. The experiments reveal that varying substituents both modulate the FROMP kinetics and enable the creation of thermoplastic materials characterized by different thermomechanical properties. Moreover, HEN&#8208;based crosslinkers are designed to enhance the resulting thermomechanical properties at high temperatures (&gt;200&#160;&#176;C). The versatility of such materials is demonstrated through direct ink writing (DIW) to rapidly produce 3D structures without the need for printed supports. This research significantly extends the range of monomers suitable for FROMP, furthering efficient production of high&#8208;performance polymeric materials.

         <title>Complementary Multisite Turnover Catalysis toward Superefficient Bifunctional Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst is in situ constructed on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative interfaces and abundant multifunctional trimetal sites for seawater electrolysis, in which interfacial Mo sites are responsible for hydrogen evolution, while Co/Fe species facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics, thus cooperatively expediting bifunctional freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69 V, outperforming most of the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The utilization of seawater for hydrogen production via water splitting is increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for the future. The key dilemma for seawater electrolysis is the incompatibility of superior hydrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;evolving activities at ampere&#8208;scale current densities for both cathodic and anodic catalysts, thus leading to large electric power consumption of overall seawater splitting. Here, in situ construction of Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 heterostructure arrays anchoring on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative catalytic interfaces and abundant multifunctional metal sites is reported, which serves as a robust bifunctional catalyst for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting at ampere&#8208;level current density. Operando Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory calculations corroborate that Mo and Co/Fe sites situated on the Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 multilevel interfaces optimize the reaction pathway and coordination environment to enhance water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption, thus cooperatively expediting hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in base. Inspiringly, this electrocatalyst can substantially ameliorate overall freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69&#160;V, along with superb long&#8208;term stability at 500&#8211;1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h, outperforming nearly all the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work offers a viable approach to design high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.

         <dc:description>
To advance high&#8208;quality imaging units in optoelectronic systems, a phototransistor that shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics is reported. Thanks to the programmable two&#8208;dimensional electron gas which can be modulated by drain/gate voltage inputs under different light exposure, a triplex photo&#8208;imaging functionality with capable of self&#8208;powering, photoconduction, and photo&#8208;synaptic operation is achieved, providing guidance toward system&#8208;on&#8208;chip photoelectric systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in the digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single&#8208;device platform are in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. Herein, an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure is reported, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEGs). Owing to the programmable feature of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs, with a particular capability of electron separation, collection and storage under different light illumination, the phototransistor shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8776;108&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 are achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage ability. The demonstration of three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Colossal Near&#8208;Field Radiative Heat Transfer Mediated by Coupled Polaritons with an Ultrahigh Dynamic Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area device near&#8208;field thermal radiation measurement system with in situ adjustable vacuum gap distances down to &lt;100&#160;nm is successfully established. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient of near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can reach unprecedented values with the help of coupled polaritons. The dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the strong coupling effect.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed the blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude owing to the tunneling evanescent waves. Exploiting this near&#8208;field enhancement holds significant potential for emerging technologies. It has been suggested that coupled polaritons can give rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of NFRHT. However, a thorough experimental verification of this phenomenon is still missing. Here this work experimentally shows that NFRHT mediated by coupled polaritons in millimeter&#8208;size graphene/SiC/SiO2 composite devices in planar plate configuration can realize about 302.8 &#177; &#8197;35.2&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the blackbody limit at a gap distance of 87&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.8&#160;nm. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient can reach unprecedented values of 0.136 WK&#8722;1 and 5440 Wm&#8722;2K&#8722;1. Additionally, a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical measurement, in conjunction with full&#8208;wave numerical simulations, provides further evidence for the coupled polaritonic characteristics of the devices. Notably, this work experimentally demonstrates dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the bias voltage, leading to an ultrahigh dynamic range of &#8776;4.115. This work ambiguously elucidates the important role of coupled polaritons in NFRHT, paving the way for the manipulation of nanoscale heat transport, energy conversion, and thermal computing via the strong coupling effect.

Lactate has emerged as a critical immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment, greatly impeding the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Hence, depriving lactate provides a favorable strategy to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). This research suggests that LAB&#8208;1 is capable of colonizing TIM and sustaining a long&#8208;term reduction in lactate concentration. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that lactate metabolism efficiently reprograms TIM.








Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) is considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. Here, a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) is selectively screened for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

An innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain&#8208;loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.








Abstract
Lung metastases are the leading cause of death among cancer patients. The challenges of inefficient drug delivery, compounded by a robust immunosuppressive microenvironment, make effective treatment difficult. Here, an innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) therapy is developed that integrates modified macrophages and engineered antitumor bacteria. These engineered macrophages, termed R&#8208;GEM cells, are designed to express RGD peptides on extracellular membranes, enhancing their tumor cell binding and intratumor enrichment. R&#8208;GEM cells are cocultured with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009, producing macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells). The intracellular bacteria maintain bioactivity for more than 24&#160;h, and the bacteria released from R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells within the tumor continue to exert bacteria&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. This is further supported by macrophage&#8208;based chemotaxis and camouflage, which enhance the intratumoral enrichment and biocompatibility of the bacteria. Additionally, R&#8208;GEM cells loaded with IFN&#947;&#8208;secreting strains (VNP&#8208;IFN&#947;) form R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells. Treatment with these cells effectively halts lung metastatic tumor progression in three mouse models (breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer). R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells vigorously activate the tumor microenvironment, suppressing tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;type macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs, and enhancing tumor&#8208;antagonizing M1&#8208;type macrophages, mature DCs, and Teffs. Du&#8208;EMME therapy offers a promising strategy for targeted and enhanced antitumor immunity in treating cancer metastases.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymyxin Mitigates Cytotoxicity and Reverses Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) is presented in the aqueous solution of antibiotics and adjuvants via dynamic covalent bonding. The resulting assemblies via RISA effectively mask the positive charge of polymyxins, preventing their interaction with negatively charged mammalian cells and reducing potential cytotoxicity, enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of polymyxins and preventing the emergence of further resistance.








Abstract
Polymyxins have been regarded as an efficient therapeutic against many life&#8208;threatening, multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacterial infections; however, the cytotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance associated with polymyxins have greatly hindered their clinical potential. Herein, the reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) of polymyxins and natural aldehydes in aqueous solution is presented. The resulting assemblies effectively mask the positively charged nature of polymyxins, reducing their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the representative PMBA4 (composed of polymyxin B (PMB) and (E)&#8208;2&#8208;heptenal (A4)) assemblies demonstrate enhanced binding to Gram&#8208;negative bacterial outer membranes and exhibit multiple antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased membrane permeability, elevated bacterial metabolism, suppression of quorum sensing, reduced ATP synthesis, and potential reduction of bacterial drug resistance. Remarkably, PMBA4 assemblies reverse drug resistance in clinically isolated drug&#8208;resistant strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in preventing and eradicating bacterial biofilms. PMBA4 assemblies efficiently eradicate Gram&#8208;negative bacterial biofilm infections in vivo and alleviate inflammatory response. This RISA strategy offers a practical and clinically applicable approach to minimize side effects, reverse drug resistance, and prevent the emergence of resistance associated with free polymyxins.

         <title>Suppressed Defects by Functional Thermally Cross&#8208;Linked Fullerene for High&#8208;Efficiency Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed tin&#8208;lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with ideal bandgap (1.2 eV) develop rapidly, while the top interface defects and Sn oxidation cannot be solved simultaneously. It is found cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) can coordinate with perovskite and optimize the interface and bulk of perovskite. This work demonstrates the optimization effect of C&#8208;PCBSD on perovskite interface and bulk.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have attracted the attention of the community due to their narrow bandgap, ideal for photovoltaic applications, especially tandem solar cells. However, the oxidation and rapid crystallization of Sn2+ and the interfacial traps hinder their development. Here, cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) is introduced during the quenching step of perovskite thin film processing to suppress the generation of surface defects at the electron transport layer interface and improve the bulk crystallinity. The C&#8208;PCBSD has strong coordination ability with Sn2+ and Pb2+ perovskite precursors, which retards the crystallization process, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and improves the perovskite bulk and surface crystallinity, yielding films with reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced interface charge extraction. Besides, the C&#8208;PCBSD network deposited on the perovskite surface displays superior hydrophobicity and oxygen resistance. Consequently, the devices with C&#8208;PCBSD obtain PCEs of up to 23.4% and retained 97% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of storage in a N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnet&#8208;Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n&#8208;GaAs via the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n&#8208;GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 








Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix l&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free SC spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n-GaAs via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n-GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;-helix &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-polyalanine, AHPA-L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free SC spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bipolar Textile Composite Electrodes Enabling Flexible Tandem Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.








Abstract
A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem&#8208;stacking configuration to yield high&#8208;voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid&#8208;state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE&#8208;based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding. BTCE shows great promise for future safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and flexible SSLMBs for a wide range of flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Retinomorphic Color Perception Based on Opponent Process Enabled by Perovskite Bipolar Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual perovskite absorber device in an antagonistic configuration is capable of generate bipolar responses with colors from the opponent pairs. Two variants (red&#8208;green and yellow&#8208;blue opponents) are fabricated, and filter&#8208;free machine color vision with high contrasts is demonstrated. The adaptation capabilities of the perovskite photodetector also ensure accurate color perception in different lighting conditions.








Abstract
The ability to perceive color by the retina can be attributed to both its trichromatic photoreceptors and the antagonistic neural wiring known as the opponent process. While neuromorphic sensors have been shown to demonstrate memory and adaptation capabilities, color perception is still challenging due to the intrinsic lack of spectral selectivity in narrow bandgap semiconductors. Furthermore, research on emulating neural wiring is severely lacking. The combination of halide perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap and a novel bipolar photodetector design emulates the efficiency of the retina in processing color information. The stimuli&#8208;responsive material is also responsible for maintaining partial color constancy&#8212;an adaptation feature. Leveraging the unique enhancement of color contrasts, an in&#8208;sensor data compression and edge detection can also be demonstrated. The color perception, chromatic adaptation, and color contrast enhancement make perovskite bipolar photodetectors a unique example where the sensor and neural wiring can be co&#8208;developed in conjunction.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels Crafted via Lignin&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel forms by diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, creating high&#8208;density crystalline domains and networks. This enhances mechanical properties (tensile strength: &#8776;20 Mpa, Young's modulus: &#8776;14 Mpa, toughness: &#8776;50 MJ&#160;m&#8315;3) and provides low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking (&#8776;100%). 









Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are typically assembled through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, posing a significant challenge in achieving ultra strength. Developing a higher strength based on molecular/nanoscale engineering concepts is a potential improvement strategy. Herein, a super&#8208;tough supramolecular hydrogel is assembled by gradually diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. Both simulations and analytical results indicate that the assembly and subsequent enhancement of the crosslinked network are primarily attributed to LS&#8208;induced formation and gradual densification of strong crystalline domains within the hydrogel. The optimized hydrogel exhibits impressive mechanical properties with tensile strength of &#8776;20&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of &#8776;14&#160;MPa, and toughness of &#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8315;3, making it the strongest lignin&#8208;PVA/polymer hydrogel known so far. Moreover, LS provides the supramolecular hydrogel with excellent low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking capability (&#8776;100%). Interestingly, the diffusion ability of LS is demonstrated for self&#8208;restructuring damaged supramolecular hydrogel, achieving 3D patterning on hydrogel surfaces, and enhancing the local strength of the freeze&#8208;thaw PVA hydrogel. The goal is to foster a versatile hydrogel platform by combining eco&#8208;friendly LS with biocompatible PVA, paving the way for innovation and interdisciplinarity in biomedicine, engineering materials, and forestry science.

         <title>Biometabolically Derived Selenium Nanoparticles Armed with Protein Protective Suit toward High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Se Batteries</title>

&#8220;Functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; bio&#8208;selenium nanoparticles are developed by Bacillus subtilis subsp.&#8217;s microbial metabolism process from toxic selenite (SeO32&#8722;), in which selenium nanoparticles are tightly encased in a natural biomembrane with rich functional groups containing nitrogen and phosphorus that effectively suppress shuttle effect and alleviate volume expansion, achieving superior electrochemical and structural stability.








Abstract
Selenium (Se) serves as a burgeoning high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of Se cathode is strictly limited by low Se utilization and inferior cycling stability arising from intrinsic volume expansion and notorious shuttle effect. Herein, a microbial metabolism strategy is developed to prepare &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules via Bacillus subtilis subsp. from selenite in sewage, in which Se nanoparticles are armed with a natural biological protein membrane with rich nitrogen and phosphorus, achieving the eco&#8208;efficient conversion of trash into treasure (selenite, SeO32&#8722; &#8594; Selenium, Se). The appealing&#8208;design &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules are beneficial to accommodate volume changes of Se in electrochemical reactions, confining polyselenides via chemisorption, and enhancing mechanical strength of electrode by associated bacteria debris, realizing comprehensive utilization of microorganism. By conceptualizing &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules, rather than artificial Se&#8208;host composites, as cathode for lithium&#8211;selenium batteries, it exhibits outstanding cycling stability and improved rate performance. This strategy opens the door to design smart electrode materials with unattainable structure that cannot be achieved by traditional approaches, achieving eco&#8208;efficient conversion of pollutants into energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials, which will be a promising research field for interdisciplinary of energy, biology, and environment.

         <title>Optimizing Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology via Solid Additive Strategy Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 19.50% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM) is constructed and optimized in the all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the use of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. Through subtly modifying the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene additives, improved molecular packing and well&#8208;defined DFMN are simultaneously realized, leading to a record efficiency of 19.50% for all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), in which the donor and the acceptor can self&#8208;assemble into a double&#8208;fibril structure, is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in organic solar cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that such DFNM can be constructed and optimized in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the assistance of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. It is revealed that the incorporation of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene can induce a stepwise regulation in the aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules during film casting and thermal annealing processes. Through altering the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene solid additives, both the intermolecular interactions and molecular miscibility with the host materials can be precisely tuned, which allows for the optimization of the molecular aggregation process and facilitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, and thus leading to reinforced molecular packing and optimized DFNM. As a result, an unprecedented efficiency of 19.50% (certified as 19.1%) is obtained for 2&#8208;ethoxynaphthalene&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT&#8208;X all&#8208;PSCs with excellent photostability (T80&#160;=&#160;1750&#160;h). This work reveals that the optimization of DFNM via solid additive strategy is a promising avenue to boosting the performance of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>In&#8208;Sublattice Carrier Transition Enabled Polarimetric Photodetectors with Reconfigurable Polarity Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is proposed. By changing the gate voltage, the device exhibits reconfigurable PR values from positive to negative, covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Moreover, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is implemented. This work makes a conceptual advance in designing next&#8208;generation miniaturized highly polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Miniaturized polarimetric photodetectors based on anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials attract potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact polarimeters. However, these photodetectors are hindered by the small polarization ratio values and complicated artificial structures. Here, a novel polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is demonstrated. The unique periodic sublattice structure of CdSb2Se3Br2 features an in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition preferred along Sb2Se3 chains. Leveraging on the in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, gate voltage has an anisotropic modulation effect on the band alignment of heterostructure along sublattice. Consequently, the heterostructure exhibits a polarization&#8208;tunable photo&#8208;induced threshold voltage shift, which provides reconfigurable PR values from positive (unipolar regime) to negative (bipolar regime), covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Using this anisotropic photovoltaic effect, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is successfully implemented. This work provides a new platform for developing next&#8208;generation highly polarimetric optoelectronics.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes into High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt is utilized to repair highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Consequently, upcycled materials can overcome the key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward &#8220;direct upcycling.&#8221; Herein, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6&#160;V, especially its fast charging capability at 15&#160;C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Liquid Gallium&#8208;Assisted Pyrolysis of MOF Affording CNT Non&#8208;Hollow Frameworks in High Yields for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis and subsequent acid treatment are cleverly used to obtain a high yield of O&#8208;rich carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow framework (NOCNTF&#8208;15) at relatively low temperatures. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental results mutually confirm that the NOCNTF&#8208;15 is a high capacity and ultralong life anode for SIBs.








Abstract
Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low&#8208;energy (600&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;yield (82&#160;wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O&#8208;containing groups gives a non&#8208;hollow framework composed of N/O&#8208;enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF&#8208;15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low&#8208;cost CNTs and other MOFs&#8208;derived carbon materials in high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O-containing groups gives a non-hollow framework composed of N/O-enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF-15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultra-stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low-cost CNTs and other MOFs-derived carbon materials in high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Blending For Co&#8208;Deposition of Electron Transport and Perovskite Layers Enables Over 24% Efficiency Stable Conventional Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transport layer (ETL) materials have been rationally designed for in situ blending to co&#8208;deposit ETL and light&#8208;absorbing layers simultaneously in conventional perovskite solar cells. Such a strategy significantly improves the qualities of perovskite growth and buried interface to improve charge transport/collection. A record high power conversion efficiency over 24% is achieved for organic ETLs based devices.








Abstract
Simplifying the manufacturing processes of multilayered high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is yet of vital importance for their cost&#8208;effective production. Herein, an in situ blending strategy is presented for co&#8208;deposition of electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber by incorporating (3&#8208;(7&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraoxo&#8208;3,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo&#8208; [lmn][3,8]phenanthrolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;yl)propyl)phosphonic acid (NDP) into the perovskite precursor solutions. The phosphonic acid&#8208;like anchoring group coupled with its large molecular size drives the migration of NDP toward indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form a distinct ETL during perovskite film forming. This strategy circumvents the critical wetting issue and simultaneously improves the interfacial charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs based on in situ blended NDP achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.01%, which is one of the highest values for PSCs using organic ETLs. This performance is notably higher than that of ETL&#8208;free (21.19%) and independently spin&#8208;coated (21.42%) counterparts. More encouragingly, the in situ blending strategy dramatically enhances the device stability under harsh conditions by retaining over 90% of initial efficiencies after 250&#160;h in 100&#160;&#176;C or 65% humidity storage. Moreover, this strategy is universally adaptable to various perovskite compositions, device architectures, and electron transport materials (ETMs), showing great potential for applications in diverse optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reverse Hydrogen Spillover on Metal Oxides for Water&#8208;Promoted Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work unravels the water&#8208;effected mechanisms on the metal oxide surface during ethanol oxidation reactions through various in situ surface sensitive spectroscopies: i) the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites leads to water poisoning; ii) the proton&#8208;induced active *OOH species, achieved by accelerated reverse hydrogen spillover among metal oxides, enhances water&#8208;promoted functionality.








Abstract
Understanding the water&#8208;involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water&#8208;promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO&#8208;SnO2 imparts water&#8208;resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO2. The water&#8208;promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O2 activation on the SnO2 surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO&#8208;C&#8208;SnO2 showcases a remarkable 60&#8208;fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO2 under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Presodiation Agent Via Triggering Anionic Oxidation Activity in Sodium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Ni into specific Li sites within the Na2O framework tunes band structures, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion and accelerating the decomposition kinetics of Na2O. It can serve as a cathode presodiation agent to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycling; thus, enhancing the energy density of practical Na&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.








Abstract
Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) full&#8208;cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05&#9633;0.06)2O (Ni&#8211;Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni&#8211;O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8&#160;V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g&#8776;Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate &gt;80%). Incorporating currently&#8208;modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na&#8208;ion full&#8208;cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Further, not limited to Ni&#8211;Na2O, the structure&#8211;function relationship between the anionic oxidation mechanism and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface fabrication is revealed as a paradigm for the development of sacrificial cathode presodiation agent.

         <title>Homogeneous Fluorine Doping toward Highly Conductive and Stable Li10GeP2S12 Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;doped Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 possesses enhanced stability against moist air and lithium metal due to decreased H2O adsorption energy and formation energy of lithium vacancy, showing nearly one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of Li10GeP2S12 after air&#8208;exposure. The Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 monolayer solid electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of Li10GeP2S12 have gained extensive attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li10GeP2S12 is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The atomic&#8208;scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li10GeP2S12 is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li10GeP2S12. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li10GeP2S12 with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li10GeP2S12 system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; have gained extensive attention in all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all-solid-state lithium batteries. The atomic-scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li&lt;sub&gt;9.98&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.99&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;11.98&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt; maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | lithium all-solid-state batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability, showing 80.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields.

Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Interstitial Boron Atoms in Pd Aerogel Selectively Switch the Pathway for Glycolic Acid Synthesis from Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdB alloy aerogel is synthesized as an anode catalyst for selective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion, achieving a peak mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1 and GA Faraday efficiency of 93.8%. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations uncover the ligand effect and oxophilicity enhancement originating from B incorporation synergistically regulate the adsorption and conversion of key intermediates, thereby allowing the highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable chemicals is garnering significant attention as it opens a mild avenue for waste resource utilization. However, achieving high activity and selectivity for valuable C2 products during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate on Pd electrocatalysts remains challenging. The strong interaction between Pd and carbonyl (*CO) intermediates leads to undesirable over&#8208;oxidation and poisoning of Pd sites, which hinders the highly efficient C2 products production. Herein, a nonmetallic alloying strategy is employed to fabricate a Pd&#8208;boron alloy aerogel (PdB), wherein B atoms are induced to regulate the electron structure and surface oxophilicity. This approach allows a remarkable mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1, glycolic acid (GA) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8%, and stable 100 h cyclic electrolysis. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal the contributions of B inserted in Pd lattice on highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. Interestingly, the heightened surface oxophilicity and regulated electronic structure by B incorporation weakened *CO intermediates adsorption and enhanced hydroxyl species affinity to accelerate oxidative *OH adspecies formation, thereby synergistically avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and boosting GA synthesis. This work provides valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GA synthesis via an oxophilic B motifs incorporation strategy.

         <title>Constructing Pd and Cu Crowding Single Atoms by Protein Confinement to Promote Sonogashira Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a convenient protein confinement strategy that tightly locates crowded&#160;Pd and Cu single atoms to promote the substrate activation and transmetallation in the Sonogashira reaction. These results provide important clues for the efficient construction of high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalysts with multiple neighboring active centers and&#160;achieving valuable organic transformations cocatalyzed by multiple active centers.








Abstract
For multicenter&#8208;catalyzed reactions, it is important to accurately construct heterogeneous catalysts containing multiple active centers with high activity and low cost, which&#160;is more challenging compared to homogeneous catalysts because of the low activity and spatial confinement of active centers in the loaded state. Herein, a convenient protein confinement strategy is reported to locate Pd and Cu single atoms in crowding state on carbon coated alumina for promoting Sonogashira reaction, the most powerful method for constructing the acetylenic moiety in molecules. The single&#8208;atomic Pd and Cu centers take advantage in not only the maximized atomic utilization for low cost, but also the much&#8208;enhanced performance by facilitating the activation of aryl halides and alkynes. Their locally crowded dispersion brings them closer to each other, which facilitates the transmetallation process of acetylide intermediates between them. Thus, the Sonogashira reaction is drove smoothly by the obtained catalyst with a turnover frequency value of 313 h&#8722;1, much more efficiently than that by commercial Pd/C and CuI catalyst, conventional Pd and Cu nanocatalysts, and mixed Pd and Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst. The obtained catalyst also exhibits the outstanding durability in the recycling test.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real&#8208;time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance.

&lt;p&gt;A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real-time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real-time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance-dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real-timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real-time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real-timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real-timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adhesion&#8208;Controlled Heterogeneous Nucleation of Tin Halide Perovskites for Eco&#8208;Friendly Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskites are regulated by incorporating CsF into the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer to adjust the adhesive strength of interfaces. As a result, FASnI2Br&#8211;CsF indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12%. Ultimately, the utilization of tin halide perovskite IPVs to power radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors is successfully explored.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the advancement of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) that directly power wireless IoT devices. The interest in lead&#8208;free perovskites for IPVs stems from their similar optoelectronic properties to high&#8208;performance lead halide perovskites, but without concerns about toxic lead leakage in indoor environments. However, currently prevalent lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs, especially tin halide perovskites (THPs), still exhibit inferior performance, arising from their uncontrollable crystallization. Here, a novel adhesive bonding strategy is proposed for precisely regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of THPs by introducing alkali metal fluorides. These ionic adhesives boost the work of adhesion at the buried interface between substrates and perovskite film, subsequently reducing the contact angle and energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high&#8208;quality THP films. The resulting THP solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.12% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs and successfully powering radio frequency identification&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>

A ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is reported for band engineering of PQD solids, which can form a gradient band structure within the PQD solids with substantially diminishes trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, significantly promoting the charge transport within the PQD solids. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQD solar cells give a remarkable efficiency of up to 16.44%.








Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments can firmly anchor to the PQD surface through the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interference of ATP&#8208;Adenosine Axis by Engineered Biohybrid for Amplifying Immunogenic Cell Death&#8208;Mediated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF) is rationally designed to activate immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;therapy and impede the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, which can establish a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity and activate the enduring immunological memory to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, thereby amplifying ICD&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) often results in the production and accumulation of adenosine (ADO), a byproduct that negatively impacts the therapeutic effect as well as facilitates tumor development and metastasis. Here, an innovative strategy is elaborately developed to effectively activate ICD while avoiding the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine. Specifically, ZIF&#8208;90, an ATP&#8208;responsive consumer, is synthesized as the core carrier to encapsulate AB680 (CD73 inhibitor) and then coated with an iron&#8208;polyphenol layer to prepare the ICD inducer (AZTF), which is further grafted onto prebiotic bacteria via the esterification reaction to obtain the engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF). Particularly, the designed Bc@AZTF can actively enrich in tumor sites and respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment to offload AZTF nanoparticles, which can consume intracellular ATP (iATP) content and simultaneously inhibit the ATP&#8208;adenosine axis to reduce the accumulation of adenosine, thereby alleviating adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and strikingly amplifying ICD effect. Importantly, the synergy of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (&#945;PD&#8208;1) with Bc@AZTF not only establishes a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity but also activates long&#8208;lasting immune memory effects to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, presenting a new paradigm for ICD treatment combined with adenosine metabolism.

         <title>An Electrolyte Engineered Homonuclear Copper Complex as Homogeneous Catalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) with a Cu atom proximal distance of 4.7 &#197; is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the lithium&#8211;sulfur redox reactions. The optimized content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaches the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T in electrolyte, further boosting its homogeneous optimization activity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries suffer from severe polysulfide shuttle, retarded sulfur conversion kinetics and notorious lithium dendrites, which has curtailed the discharge capacity, cycling lifespan and safety. Engineered catalysts act as a feasible strategy to synchronously manipulate the evolution behaviors of sulfur and lithium species. Herein, a chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the Li&#8211;S redox reactions. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T provides completely active sites and sufficient contact for homogeneously guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions, and stabilizing the lithium working interface according to the synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography, small angle neutron scattering and COMSOL results. Moreover, Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T with the content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaching saturated concentration in electrolyte further boosts the homogeneous optimization function in really operated Li&#8211;S batteries. Accordingly, the capacity retention of the Li&#8211;S battery is elevated from 51.4% to 86.3% at 0.2 C, and reaches 77.0% at 1.0 C over 400 cycles. Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1).

Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu-2-T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft-packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;Capacity Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle is achieved in a tungsten(W)&#8208;introduced cathode through microstructure regulation. The modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries can effectively promote lithium ion&#160;transport and thus endow capacity enhancement. This work provides insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship for the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.









Abstract
Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, it is demonstrated that an increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which can lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Enabled by Hollow Carbon Fibrous Electrodes with Reduced Graphitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2 ceramic nanofibers are employed as the catalytic template to fabricate hollow tubular N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanofibers, which has high tensile strength, robust structural flexibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. High K+&#8208;storage capacity at low plateau potential and fast K+&#8208;intercalation kinetics are achieved to build a flexible K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor.








Abstract
The large size of K+ ions (1.38 &#197;) sets a challenge in achieving high kinetics and long lifespan of potassium storage devices. Here, a fibrous ZrO2 membrane is utilized as a reactive template to construct a dual&#8208;carbon K&#8208;ion capacitor. Unlike graphite, ZrO2&#8208;catalyzed graphitic carbon presents a relatively disordered layer arrangement with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.378&#160;nm to accommodate K+ insertion/extraction. Pyridine&#8208;derived nitrogen sites can locally store K&#8208;ions without disrupting the formation of stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Consequently, N&#8208;doped hollow graphitic carbon fiber achieves a K+&#8208;storage capacity (primarily below 1&#160;V), which is 1.5 time that of commercial graphite. Potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors are assembled using the hollow carbon fiber electrodes and the ZrO2 nanofiber membrane as the separator. The capacitor exhibits a high power of 40 000 W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, full charge in 8.5&#8201;s, 93% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2&#8201;A g&#8722;1, and a low self&#8208;discharge rate of 8.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The scalability and high performance of the lattice&#8208;expanded tubular carbon electrodes underscores may advance the practical potassium&#8208;ion capacitors.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Melt&#8208;Processing of Birefringent Cellulosic Materials for Eco&#8208;Friendly Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. With customizable processing forms, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, recyclability, and biodegradability. The diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Ubiquitous anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials with a rapidly rising annual consumption (over 1010&#160;m2) can pose a serious environmental burden. Biobased cellulosic materials with birefringence offer attractive sustainable alternatives, but their scalable solvent&#8208;free processing remain challenging. Here, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure of preferred oriented cellulose, the strategy balances the contradiction between the strong confinement of long&#8208;range ordered structures and the molecular motility required for entropically&#8208;driven reconstruction. Equipped with customizable processing forms including mold&#8208;pressing, spinning, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, and blade&#8208;coating, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, self&#8208;healing efficiency (94.5%), recyclability, and biodegradability. Moreover, the diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The strategy is expected to provide references for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of cellulose and promote sustainable innovation in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting industry.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Visual&#8208;Respiratory Synapse as Multimodal Scene Recognition System with Oxidized&#8208;Vacancies MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse using monolayer vacancy&#8208;induced oxidized MXene is introduced, leveraging synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. Oxidized vacancies exhibit photocarrier trapping and hydroxyl preference, enabling environmental and multimodal neural network image recognition. This device promises advancements in intelligent interactive systems through enhanced sensory integration and responsive neural network functionalities.








Abstract
In the pursuit of artificial neural systems, the integration of multimodal plasticity, memory retention, and perceptual functions stands as a paramount objective in achieving neuromorphic perceptual components inspired by the human brain, to emulating the neurological excitability tuning observed in human visual and respiratory collaborations. Here, an artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse is presented with monolayer oxidized MXene (VRSOM) exhibiting synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. The VRSOM enables to realize facile modulation of synaptic behaviors, encompassing postsynaptic current, sustained photoconductivity, stable facilitation/depression properties, and &#8220;learning&#8208;experience&#8221; behavior. These performances rely on the privileged photocarrier trapping characteristics and the hydroxyl&#8208;preferential selectivity inherent of oxidized vacancies. Moreover, environment recognitions and multimodal neural network image identifications are achieved through multisensory integration, underscoring the potential of the VRSOM in reproducing human&#8208;like perceptual attributes. The VRSOM platform holds significant promise for hardware output of human&#8208;like mixed&#8208;modal interactions and paves the way for perceiving multisensory neural behaviors in artificial interactive devices.

Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding
The anisotropic lubricity between two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting tin selenide nanoplates and a graphene substrate enables the motion of nanoplates strictly along the zigzag direction of graphene. A subsequential in situ annealing welds the nanoplates together and yields defect&#8208;free interfaces. More details can be found in article number 2312199 by Salvador Barraza&#8208;Lopez, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kai Chang, and co&#8208;workers.

Gold nanomaterials possess many appealing material properties, such as facile control over their size/shape and surface functionality, intrinsic chemical inertness yet with high biocompatibility, adjustable localized surface plasmon resonances, tunable conductivity, wide electrochemical window, etc. Such material attributes have been recently utilized for designing and fabricating soft bioelectronics and optoelectronics. This motivates to give a comprehensive overview of this burgeoning field. The discussion of representative tailor&#8208;made gold nanomaterials, including gold nanocrystals, ultrathin gold nanowires, vertically aligned gold nanowires, hard template&#8208;assisted gold nanowires/gold nanotubes, bimetallic/trimetallic gold nanowires, gold nanomeshes, and gold nanosheets, is begun. This is followed by the description of various fabrication methodologies for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as strain sensors, pressure sensors, electrochemical sensors, electrophysiological devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, optoelectronics, and others. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Rational Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the efficiency of 2D PSCs, focusing on component&#160;engineering, crystal&#160;structure and photovoltaic properties. The strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique and interface optimization, are systematically discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites are outlined to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
In the quest for durable photovoltaic devices, 2D halide perovskites have emerged as a focus of extensive research. However, the reduced dimension in structure is accompanied by inferior optical&#8208;electrical properties, such as widened band gap, enhanced exciton binding energy, and obstructed charge transport. As a result, the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lags significantly behind their 3D counterparts. To overcome these constraints, extensive investigations into materials and processing techniques are pursued rigorously to augment the efficiency of 2D PSCs. Herein, The cutting&#8208;edge delve into developments in 2D PSCs, with a focus on chemical and material engineering, as well as their structure and photovoltaic properties. The review starts with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the key evaluation criteria of 2D PSCs. Then, the strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique, and interface optimization, to simultaneously boost efficiency and stability are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance will be outlined.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial strategy has attracted increasing attentions due to its remarkable impact on synergistically optimizing carrier and phonon transport properties. This review overviews and defines five typical interstitials, including rattling, decoupling, interlayer, dynamic, and liquid interstitials. Their transport mechanisms in thermoelectric materials are thoroughly illustrated, and future development directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms are identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial, and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium&#8208;ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast&#8208;charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high&#8208;rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast&#8208;charging applications.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Wetting Behavior&#8208;Induced Interfacial transmission of Energy and Signal: Materials, Mechanisms, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of energy and signal transmission for electricity, light, and heat at wetting interfaces, elucidating their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. Harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim of providing strategies.








Abstract
Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;amp;S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Cycling of Na Metal Batteries at Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study revisits the carbon interlayer strategy, establishing its threshold for Na deposition. Achieving an ultrahigh Na deposition capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8315;2 with 90% depth of discharge (DOD), this strategy addresses dendrite formation issues. This approach surpasses traditional hosting/seeding methods, which struggle with capacities &gt;10 mAh cm&#8315;2, offering valuable insights into interfacial ion transfer under extreme conditions.








Abstract
The development of sodium metal batteries has long been impeded by dendrite formation issues. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, exemplified by sodiophilic hosting/seeding layers, have demonstrated great success in suppressing dendrite formation. However, addressing high&#8208;capacity applications (&gt;10 mAh cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Herein, the study revisits the interlayer strategy by simply covering a carbon nanotube (CNT) film onto the surface of a sodium metal anode, unlocking its overlooked potential for ultrahigh capacity applications. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the interlayer's fast&#8208;ion&#8208;storage feature, enabling deposition at the interface without capacity limitations. Consequently, in symmetric cells, one&#8208;year long&#8208;term reversible cycling and a record&#8208;high capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8722;2 under 90% depth of discharge is achieved, representing a significant breakthrough for stabilizing Na anode. Furthermore, the full cell with a 50&#8208;&#181;m thin metal anode and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) delivers a stable capacity of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 for 270 cycles (94% capacity retention).

         <title>Buried Interface Strategies with Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks are developed to control the perovskite energy level and defects at the buried interface of inverted devices. The power conversion efficiency is improved to 25.68% for conventional bandgap devices and 22.92% for wide&#8208;bandgap devices. Additionally, these cells demonstrated excellent stability, establishing a solid foundation for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Simultaneously controlling defects and film morphology at the buried interface is a promising approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, two new donor&#8210;acceptor type semiconductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed, COFTPA and COFICZ. The carefully designed COFs structure not only effectively regulates the morphology and defects of the buried interface film, but also realizes the alignment with the energy level of the perovskite film and enhances the extraction and transmission of the interface charge. Among them, COFICZ&#8208;treated inverted PSCs achieved a maxmum PCE of 25.68% (certified 25.14%), the inverted PCE reached a minimum PCE of 22.92% for 1 cm2 device. The efficiency of inverted PSCs with a 1.68&#160;eV wide bandgap reached 22.92%, which is the highest datum of the reported 1.68 eV wide bandgap PSC. This lays the groundwork for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Additionally, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated a high degree of stability during operational use and when subjected to conditions of high humidity and temperature.

         <title>Advances in the Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol into Nonoxygenated Added&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol is mainly derived from biomass, such as starch&#8208;based crops, cellulosic feedstocks, and CO/CO2. Metal oxide or zeolite catalysts can convert ethanol into valuable chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, which are important commodities serving as crucial raw materials for manufacturing various products essential to the modern society, such as plastics, tires, medicines, and perfumes.








Abstract
Given that ethanol can be obtained from abundant biomass resources (e.g., crops, sugarcane, cellulose, and algae), waste, and CO2, its conversion into value&#8208;added chemicals holds promise for the sustainable production of high&#8208;demand chemical commodities. Nonoxygenated chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, are some of the most important of these commodities, substantially contributing to modern lifestyles. Despite the industrial implementation of some ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons processes, several fundamental questions and technological challenges remain unaddressed. In addition, the utilization of ethanol as an intermediate provides new opportunities for the direct valorization of CO and CO2. Herein, the recent advances in the design of ethanol conversion catalysts are summarized, providing mechanistic insights into the corresponding reactions and catalyst deactivation, and discussing the related future research directions, including the exploitation of active site proximity to achieve better synergistic effects for reactions involving ethanol.

         <title>Biomedical&#8208;Optical&#8208;Window Tailored Cyanines for Steerable Inflammatory Bowel Disease Theranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptamethine cyanines with customizable absorption wavelengths are presented in this work. Utilizing an IBD sensitive dyes pair, a photothermal dye with 810&#160;nm absorption and its fluorescent counterpart with 800&#160;nm emission, steerable IBD theranostic non&#8208;invasively is realized.








Abstract
Tailored photophysical properties and chemical activity is the ultimate pursuit of functional dyes for in vivo biomedical theranostics. In this work, the independent regulation of the absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of heptamethine cyanines is reported. These dyes retain near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission (except a nitro&#8208;modified dye) while feature variable absorption wavelengths ranging from 590 to 860&#160;nm. This enables to obtain customized functional dyes that meet the excitation and fluorescence wavelength requirements defined by the optical properties of tissues for in vivo biomedical applications. Typically, a nitro&#8208;modified photothermal active derivative Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 is used, which features strong absorption at 810&#160;nm in PBS, a wavelength that balanced the tissue penetration depth and non&#8208;specific photothermal effect, to realize non&#8208;destructive inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy via photothermal induced up&#8208;regulation of heat shock protein 70 in the intestinal epithelial cells. The corresponding amino&#8208;modified dye Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, which can be formed in health enteric cavity by Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 after oral administration, is a fluorescence compound with the emission of 800&#160;nm in PBS. Based on the IBD sensitive transformation of Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 and Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, in vivo IBD theranostic and therapeutic effect evaluation is realized via the synergy of fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy for the first time.

A hybrid passive cooling composite is designed to enhance heat dissipation for equipment by achieving &#8776;0.98 solar reflectance and providing high evaporation cooling power. The composite lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.








Abstract
While providing electrical energy for human society, power equipment also consumes electricity and generate heat. Cooling equipment consumes a significant amount of electricity, further increasing energy consumption and load on the power grid. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop low&#8208;energy and sustainable cooling technologies for power equipment. In this study, a hybrid passive cooling composite designed to enhance heat dissipation for heavy&#8208;load power equipment is introduced. Specifically, the composite material achieves outstanding radiative cooling performance with an average solar reflectance of up to 0.98, while its excellent atmospheric water harvesting performance ensures high evaporation cooling power without the need for manual water replenishment. As a result, the composite effectively lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.

         <title>Stepwise Stiffening/Softening of and Cell Recovery from Reversibly Formulated Hydrogel Interpenetrating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell&#8208;laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis is permitted in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner.








Abstract
Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered&#8208; particularly in a reversible manner&#8208; are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step&#8208;growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500&#160;Pa&#8211;6&#160;kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask&#8208;based and two&#8208;photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase&#8208;based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D&#8208;triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco&#8208;2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.

         <title>Complex Deformation in Soft Cylindrical Structures via Programmable Sequential Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>The buckling of cylindrical shell structures upon depressurization is a well&#8208;known phenomenon. If the shells are made of soft materials, the post&#8208;buckling deformation can be fully recovered. Through a combination of experiments and simulations, the occurrence of a secondary instability in shells with a high buckling wave number is identified, which suddenly activates a coupled twisting&#8208;folding deformation mode. This rich nonlinear behavior is harnessed to design soft robotic systems capable of executing sequential tasks with a single input signal.








Abstract
The substantial deformation exhibited by hyperelastic cylindrical shells under pressurization makes them an ideal platform for programmable inflatable structures. If negative pressure is applied, the cylindrical shell will buckle, leading to a sequence of rich deformation modes, all of which are fully recoverable due to the hyperelastic material choice. While the initial buckling event under vacuum is well understood, here, the post&#8208;buckling regime is explored and a region in the design space is identified in which a coupled twisting&#8208;contraction deformation mode occurs; by carefully controlling the geometry of&#160;our homogeneous shells, the proportion of contraction versus twist can be controlled. Additionally, bending as a post&#8208;buckling deformation mode can be unlocked by varying the thickness of&#160;our shells across the circumference. Since these soft shells can fully recover from substantial deformations caused by buckling, then these instability&#8208;driven deformations are harnessed to build soft machines capable of a programmable sequence of movements with a single actuation&#160;input.

         <title>Lubricated Surface in a Vertical Double&#8208;Sided Architecture for Radiative Cooling and Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lubricated surface (LS) coating on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture is used. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. This system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected.








Abstract
Radiative cooling significantly lowers condenser temperatures below ambient levels, enabling atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) without additional energy. However, traditional sky&#8208;facing condensers have low cooling power density, and water droplets remain pinned on surface, requiring active condensate collection. To overcome these challenges, a lubricated surface (LS) coating&#8212;consisting of highly scalable polydimethylsiloxane elastomer lubricated with silicone oil&#8212;is introduced on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. Robust AWH is demonstrated from a 30 &#215; 30 cm2 sample in outdoor environments (of varying humidity levels and wind speeds in different months) and with no artificial flow of humidified air. In one outdoor test, the passive water collection rate of LS coating reaches 21 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 double that on superhydrophobic surface, 10 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. In indoor testing (20&#160;&#176;C and 80% relative humidity), this system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected. this approach achieves effective AWH in a decentralized approach that removes the need for piping infrastructure and external energy input.

Unconventional phase 2H Cu is synthesized through epitaxial growth on hcp IrNi template, and the distribution of 2H Cu can be well regulated by controlling reaction time, resulting in three kinds of IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures. Notably, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 with low Cu coverage demonstrates superior ammonia yield rate toward nitrate electroreduction, which is 3.6 times that of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 with high Cu coverage.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is emerging as a promising strategy for nitrate removal and ammonia (NH3) production using renewable electricity. Although great progresses have been achieved, the crystal phase effect of electrocatalysts on NO3RR remains rarely explored. Here, the epitaxial growth of unconventional 2H Cu on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi template, resulting in the formation of three IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures, is reported. IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 shows superior catalytic performance, with NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86% at &#8722;0.1 (vs reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) and NH3 yield rate of 687.3&#160;mmol gCu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, far better than common face&#8208;centered cubic Cu. In sharp contrast, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;30 and IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 covered by hcp Cu shell display high selectivity toward nitrite (NO2&#8722;), with NO2&#8722; FE above 60% at 0.1 (vs RHE). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 has the optimal electronic structures for NO3RR due to the highest d&#8208;band center and strongest reaction trend with the lowest energy barriers. The high electroactivity of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 originates from the abundant low coordination of Cu sites on the surface, which guarantees the fast electron transfer to accelerate the intermediate conversions. This work provides a feasible tactic to regulate the product distribution of NO3RR by crystal phase engineering of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Multidentate Fullerenes Enable Tunable and Robust Interfacial Bonding for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerenes on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Due to favorable energy level alignment and interface interactions, devices based on FM5 achieved a PCE of 15.05%, ranking among the top&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Improving the efficiency of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) is significantly hindered by energy level mismatch and weak interactions at the interface between the tin&#8208;based perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers (ETLs). In this study, four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerene molecules with 3, 4, 5, and 6 diethylmalonate groups, labeled as FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6 are synthesized, and employed as interfacial layers in TPSCs. It is observed that increasing the number of functional groups in these fullerenes leads to shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and enhance interfacial chemical interactions. Notably, FM5 exhibits a suitable energy level and robust interaction with the perovskite, effectively enhancing electron extraction and defect passivation. Additionally, the unique molecular structure of FM5 allows the exposed carbon cage to be tightly stacked with the upper fullerene cage after interaction with the perovskite, facilitating efficient charge transfer and protecting the perovskite from moisture and oxygen damage. As a result, the FM5&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 15.05%, significantly surpassing that of the PCBM&#8208;based (11.77%), FM3&#8208;based (13.54%), FM4&#8208;based (14.34%), and FM6&#8208;based (13.75%) devices. Moreover, the FM5&#8208;based unencapsulated device exhibits excellent stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after 300 h of air exposure.

Afterward, the compact cell is integrated with a printed nano&#8208;silver serpentine resistor temperature sensor, and an integrated functional circuit is created using intense&#8208;pulse sintering. Incorporating an emitting Light Emitting Diode (LED) allows temperature measurement through variations in LED brightness. The energy storage module with a high degree of conformity on the carrier surface has the advantages of small size and improved space utilization.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence and Bio/Chemiluminescence Probes for Aminopeptidases: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminopeptidases as a type of exopeptidase can hydrolyze peptide bonds at the N&#8208;terminus of polypeptide and protein, serving as various key roles in the physiological and pathological processes. In this review, diverse representative examples of recent works about activatable aminopeptidase probes are summarized including sensing, imaging, and therapy, ranging from design, and working mechanisms to biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that catalyze the cleavage of amino acid residues from the N&#8208;terminal fragment of protein or peptide substrates. Owing to their function, they play important roles in protein maturation, signal transduction, cell&#8208;cycle control, and various disease mechanisms, notably in cancer pathology. To gain better insights into their function, molecular imaging assisted by fluorescence and bio/chemiluminescence probes has become an indispensable method to their superiorities, including excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and real&#8208;time and noninvasive imaging. Numerous efforts are made to develop activatable probes that can effectively enhance efficiency and accuracy as well as minimize the side effects. This review is classified according to the type of aminopeptidases, summarizing some recent works on the design, work mechanism, and sensing, imaging, and theranostic performance of their activatable probe. Finally, the current challenges are outlined in developing activatable probes for aminopeptidases and provide possible solutions for future advancements.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Molecular Dipole Enables Tunable Interfacial Field Toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fluorine terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules is investigated to engineer interfacial properties. Through the tunable interfacial field via tailored side&#8208;chain, a gradient energy level alignment with more favorable energetics is established, and the resulting N&#8208;i&#8208;P perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record high efficiency value of 25.47% together with enhanced long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
The interfacial management in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including mitigating the carrier transport barrier and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, still remains a significant challenge for efficiency and stability enhancement. Herein, by screening a family of fluorine (F) terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules, the study aims to gain insight into the molecular dipole array toward tunable interfacial field. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that these functional interfacial dipole molecules can effectively anchor on perovskite surface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction. In addition, the tailored side&#8208;chain with terminated F atoms allows for altering and constructing a well matched perovskite/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interfacial contact. As a result, the inserting dual&#8208;site organic dipole array effectively modulates the interface to deliver a gradient energy level alignment, facilitating carrier extraction and transport. The optimal dual&#8208;site dipole trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonamide mediated N&#8208;i&#8208;P PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 25.47%, together with enhanced operational stability under 1000&#160;h of the simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination exposure. These findings are believed to provide insight into the design of dual&#8208;site molecular dipole with sufficient interfacial tunability for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

A novel &#8220;dispense&#8208;then&#8208;kill&#8221; anti&#8208;biofouling strategy is developed via copper&#8208;D&#8208;amino acid metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) coatings with precisely controlled structural symmetries. An intermediate adhesive layer comprising amorphous metal&#8208;polyphenol networks ensures robust and uniform deployment of MOF nanoarmors. This chiral coating can significantly reduce bacterial or microalgae biofilm attachment and eradicate a broad spectrum of mature biofilms through synergistic active defensive mechanisms.








Abstract
Surface coatings are designed to mitigate pervasive biofouling herald, a new era of surface protection in complex biological environments. However, existing strategies are plagued by persistent and recurrent biofilm attachment, despite the use of bactericidal agents. Herein, a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based coating with conformal microstructures to enable a new anti&#8208;biofouling mode that involves spontaneous biofilm disassembly followed by bacterial eradication is developed. A facile and universal metal&#8208;polyphenol network (MPN) is designed to robustly anchor the MOF nanoarmor of biocidal Cu2+ ions and anti&#8208;biofilm d&#8208;amino acid ligands to a variety of substrates across different material categories and surface topologies. Incorporating a diverse array of chiral amino acids endows the resultant coatings with widespread signals for biofilm dispersal, facilitating copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodynamic reactions and inherent mechano&#8208;bactericidal activities. This synergistic mechanism yields unprecedented anti&#8208;biofouling efficacy elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing transcriptomics analysis, enhancing broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, preventing biofilm formation, and destroying mature biofilms. Additionally, the chelation&#8208;directed amorphous/crystalline coatings can activate photoluminescent properties to inhibit the settlement of microalgae biofilms. This study provides a distinctive perspective on chirality&#8208;enhanced antimicrobial behaviors and pioneers a rational pathway toward developing next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;biofouling coatings for diverse applications.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Driven Semipermeable Nanoreactors for Enzymatic Cascade&#8208;Mediated Cancer Combination Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a novel type of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicle nanoreactors driven by coacervation, targeting hepatic cancer for delivery of enzyme drugs and sorafenib, which promotes cancer cell ferroptosis and apoptosis, is prepared. This approach not only curbes tumor growth but also activates immune responses, presenting a potent, multipronged cancer therapy strategy.








Abstract
Utilizing enzyme cascades as a promising approach for targeted cancer therapies holds significant potential, yet its clinical effectiveness is substantially hindered by functional losses during delivery. Complex coacervation emerges as an intriguing strategy for designing functional nanoreactors. In this study, a noteworthy achievement is presented in the development of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicles (HGS&#8208;PCVs) based on bioinspired homopolypeptoids, which serve as a facile, intelligent, and highly efficient nanoreactor tunable for glucose oxidase, hemoglobin,&#160;and sorafenib (SRF) to hepatic cancer cells. The TME&#8208;responsive permeability of HGS&#8208;PCVs enables the selective entry of glucose into their interior, triggering an enzymatic cascade reaction within the tumor. This intricate process generates toxic hydroxyl radicals while concurrently lowering the pH. Consequently, this pH shift enhances the SRF release, effectively promoting ferroptosis and apoptosis in the target cancer cells. Further, the administration of the HGS&#8208;PCVs not only initiates immunogenic cell death but also plays a crucial role in inducing the maturation of dendritic cells within lymph nodes. It stimulates an adaptive T&#8208;cell response, a crucial mechanism that contributes to impeding the growth of distant tumors in vivo, demonstrating the promising potential of PCVs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Based on FcPF6 Engineered Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) engineered spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to suppress Li+ migration and passivate the surface defects of perovskite. The additive of FcPF6 facilitates the rapid generation of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+ radicals, promoting efficient charge transfer. The efficiencies reach 22.13% in 6 &#215; 6 cm2 and 20.27% in 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 cm2 modules.








Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI doped spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is widely recognized as a beneficial hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), contributing to high device efficiencies. However, the uncontrolled migration of lithium ions (Li+) during device operation has impeded its broad adoption in scalable and stable photovoltaic modules. Herein, an additive strategy is proposed by employing ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) as a relay medium to enhance the hole extraction capability of the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD via the instant oxidation function. Besides, the novel Fc&#8211;Li interaction effectively restricts the movement of Li+. Simultaneously, the dissociative hexafluorophosphate group is cleverly exploited to regulate the unstable iodide species on the perovskite surface, further inhibiting the formation of migration channels and stabilizing the interfaces. This modification leads to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 22.13% and 20.27% in 36 cm2 (active area of 18 cm2) and 100 cm2 (active area of 56 cm2) perovskite solar modules (PSMs), respectively, with exceptional operational stability obtained for over 1000 h under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 procedure. The novel FcPF6&#8208;based engineering approach is pivotal for advancing the industrialization of PSCs, particularly those relying on high&#8208;performance spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208; based HTLs.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic&#8208;Microbial Biohybrid for Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial biohybrid is proposed with Azotobacter Vinelandii (A. Vinelandii) interfaced directly on polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA) for artificial N2 fixation. The rationally designed biohybrid of NiO@PDA/A. Vinelandii biohybrid achieves a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 4.14 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) conversion to ammonia (NH3) in a mild condition is a big chemical challenge. The whole&#8208;cell diazotrophs based biological NH3 synthesis is one of the most promising strategies. Herein, the first attempt of photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial (PEC&#8208;MB) biohybrid is contributed for artificial N2 fixation, where Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii) is interfaced directly with polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA). By virtue of excellent bio&#8208;adhesive activity, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility of PDA layer, abundant A. vinelandii are effectively adsorbed on NiO@PDA to form NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid, and the rationally designed biohybrid achieved a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 1.85&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1/108 cells (4.14&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). In addition, this biohybrid can operate both under illumination with a PEC model or in dark with an electrocatalytic (EC) model to implement long&#8208;term and successional NH3 synthesis. The enhancement mechanism of NH3 synthesis in NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid can be ascribed to the increase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8208;hydrogen (NADH) and adenosine 5&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and over expression of nitrogen&#8208;fixing genes of nifH, nifD and nifK in nitrogenase. This innovative PEC&#8208;MB biohybrid strategy sheds light on the fundamental mechanism and establishes proof of concept of biotic&#8208;abiotic photosynthetic systems for sustainable chemical production.

         <title>Engineered Protein Hydrogels as Biomimetic Cellular Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extracellular matrix (ECM) influences cellular behaviors like proliferation and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with customizable properties, can mimic the ECM functions. These hydrogels, formed through self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, affect cells via bioactive domains in their polymer backbone. This review explores the modular design, stabilization methods, and future directions of these hydrogels as biomimetic scaffolds for cell culture.








Abstract
The biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a pivotal role in regulating cellular behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with highly tunable multifunctional properties, have the potential to replicate key features of the native ECM. Formed by self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels can induce a range of cell behaviors through bioactive and functional domains incorporated into the polymer backbone. Using recombinant techniques, the amino acid sequence of the protein backbone can be designed with precise control over the chain&#8208;length, folded structure, and cell&#8208;interaction sites. In this review, the modular design of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels from both a molecular&#8208; and network&#8208;level perspective are discussed, and summarize recent progress and case studies to highlight the diverse strategies used to construct biomimetic scaffolds. This review focuses on amino acid sequences that form structural blocks, bioactive blocks, and stimuli&#8208;responsive blocks designed into the protein backbone for highly precise and tunable control of scaffold properties. Both physical and chemical methods to stabilize dynamic protein networks with defined structure and bioactivity for cell culture applications are discussed. Finally, a discussion of future directions of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels as biomimetic cellular scaffolds is concluded.

         <title>Spiking Neural Network Integrated with Impact Ionization Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Neuron and a Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Homing Phage Nanofibers for Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically engineered phages display a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating peptide on the sidewall and a tumor&#8208;homing peptide at the tip. They site&#8208;specifically nucleate Pt nanozyme on the sidewall. The resultant phages can home to breast tumor and catalyze the conversion of tumoral hydrogen peroxide into oxygen. This strategy solves the problem of tumor hypoxia and improves the efficacy of photodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) eliminates cancer cells by converting endogenous oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, its efficacy is significantly hindered by hypoxia in solid tumors. Hence, to engineer filamentous fd phage, a human&#8208;friendly bacteria&#8208;specific virus is proposed, into a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating photosensitizer&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing nanofiber for enhanced production of ROS in a hypoxic tumor. Specifically, Pt&#8208;binding and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are genetically displayed on the sidewall and tip of the fd phage, respectively. The Pt&#8208;binding peptides induced nucleation and orientation of Pt nanozymes (PtNEs) on the sidewall of the phage. The resultant PtNE&#8208;coated tumor&#8208;homing phage exhibits significantly enhanced sustained catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide in hypoxic tumors into O2 for producing ROS needed for PDT, compared to non&#8208;phage&#8208;templated PtNE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the catalytic mechanism of the phage&#8208;templated PtNE. After intravenous injection of the PtNE&#8208;coated indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing phages into breast tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the nanofibers home to the tumors and effectively inhibit tumor growth by the PtNE&#8208;enhanced PDT. The nanofibers can also serve as a tumor&#8208;homing imaging probe due to the fluorescence of ICG. This work demonstrates that filamentous phage, engineered to become tumor&#8208;homing nanozyme&#8208;nucleating tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;relieving nanofibers, can act as cancer&#8208;targeting nanozymes with improved catalytic performance for effective targeted PDT.

         <title>Tuning Lipid Nanoparticles for RNA Delivery to Extrahepatic Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of lipid nanoparticles (LNP)&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This perspective summarizes the recent progress in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs and provides an outlook of shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms.








Abstract
RNA therapeutics have been successfully transitioned into clinical applications. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely employed as nonviral delivery vehicles for RNA therapeutics in commercial vaccine and gene therapy products. However, the bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of LNP&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This challenge underscores the need to design LNPs capable of delivering RNA to organs beyond the liver. In this perspective, recent progress is discussed in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs. Organ&#8208;selective targeting capability is achieved by either altering the composition of the LNP formulation or chemically modifying the ionizable lipid component. Both approaches result in changes in the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, which subsequently alters the composition of the biomolecular corona that adsorbs onto its surface following administration. The biomolecular corona is a known mechanism that mediates organ&#8208;selective LNP delivery. Furthermore, this perspective aims to provide an outlook on shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms. Potential efforts include targeting specific cell types, improving the safety profile of LNPs, and developing strategies to overcome physiological barriers against organ&#8208;specific delivery.

         <title>Best Practices for Assessing Performance of Photocatalytic Water Splitting Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a popular subject, and there have been increasing reports on this subject. One challenge in such a situation is reporting appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the others&#8217; results. This paper provides basic information concerning the experimental setup, data acquisition and processing methods, and standardized denotation of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a very popular research subject in recent years. Consequently, it is important to report appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the results generated by others. However, experimental methods and measures of photocatalytic performance are not yet sufficiently systematic. In the present manuscript, experimental procedures and standardization of photocatalytic performance are described in relation to the basic theory of photocatalytic water splitting.

         <dc:description>
A study of ultrasmall quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is presented and a correlation between their composition, structural ordering, and optical properties is established. The work starts from the synthesis of Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se nanocrystals, followed by multipronged characterization of their structural and optical properties, and supported by theory calculation approaches. It is concluded that Copper atoms and cationic vacancies work in pairs to emit light from the I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group nanocrystals.








Abstract
The compositional tunability of non&#8208;isovalent multicomponent chalcogenide thin films and the extent of atomic ordering of their crystal structure is key to the performance of many modern technologies. In contrast, the effects of ordering are rarely studied for quantum&#8208;confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals. In this paper, the possibilities around composition tunability and atomic ordering are explored in ultrasmall ternary and quaternary quantum dots, taking I&#8208;III&#8208;VI&#8208;group Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se semiconductor as a case study. A quantitative synthesis for 3.3&#160;nm quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is developed and shown that cation and cationic vacancy ordering can be achieved in these systems consisting of only 100s of atoms. Combining experiment and theoretical calculations, the relationship between structural ordering and optical properties of the materials are demonstrated. It is found that the arrangement and ordering of cationic sublattice plays an important role in the luminescent efficiency. Specifically, the concentration of Cu&#8208;vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu&#8208;vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I&#8208;III&#8208;VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals&#8208;Intermediated Hydrogel for Boosting the Biosensing Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 core/shell hetero perovskite nanocrystals with superior water stability are obtained via a trinity strategy by integrating Mn (II) substitution with CsPb2Cl5 inert shell and NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH coating. Hetero perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based hydrogel biosensor provides pesticide information on food products, achieving on&#8208;site monitoring of chlorpyrifos at the nanogram per milliliter level.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have become attractive nanomaterials for advanced biosensors, yet the structural design remains challenging due to the trade&#8208;off between environmental stability and sensing sensitivity. Herein, a trinity strategy is proposed to address this issue by integrating Mn (II) substitution with CsPb2Cl5 inert shell and NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH coating for designing Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 core/shell hetero perovskite nanocrystals (PMCP PNCs). The trinity strategy isolates the emissive Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 core from water and the Mn2+ d&#8211;d transition generates photoluminescence with a long lifetime, endowing the NH2&#8208;PEG&#8208;COOH capped Mn2+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3/CsPb2Cl5 PNCs with robust water stability and oxygen&#8208;sensitive property. Given the structural integration, photoluminescent hydrogel biosensors are designed by embedding the PMCP PNCs into the hydrogel system to deliver on&#8208;site pesticide information on food products. Impressively, benefiting from the dual enzyme triggered&#8208;responsive property of PMCP PNCs, the hydrogel biosensor is endowed with ultra&#8208;high sensitivity toward chlorpyrifos pesticide at the nanogram per milliliter level. Such a robust PMCP PNCs&#8208;based hydrogel sensor can provide accurate pesticide information while guiding the construction of photoluminescent biosensors for upcoming on&#8208;site applications.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Crystallization Regulation and Bulk Defect Passivation for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D porous channels and high crystalline orientation of imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) facilitate the crystallization and defect elimination of the perovskite film. The recombination of photogenerated carriers is thus reduced and the perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent efficiency and high stability.








Abstract
The low crystallinity of the perovskite layers and many defects at grain boundaries within the bulk phase and at interfaces are considered huge barriers to the attainment of high performance and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a robust photoelectric imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) is introduced to precisely control the perovskite crystallization process and effectively passivate defects at grain boundaries through a sequential deposition method. The 1D porous channels, abundant active sites, and high crystallization orientation of PyPor&#8208;COF offer advantages for regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and eliminating defects. Moreover, the intrinsic electronic characteristics of PyPor&#8208;COF endow a more closely matched energy level arrangement within the perovskite layer, which promotes charge transport and thereby suppresses the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The champion PSCs containing PyPor&#8208;COF achieved power conversion efficiencies of 24.10% (0.09 cm2) and 20.81% (1.0 cm2), respectively. The unpackaged optimized device is able to maintain its initial efficiency of 80.39% even after being exposed to air for 2000 h. The device also exhibits excellent heating stability and light stability. This work gives a new impetus to the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via employing COFs.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Biligand Frameworks for Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are employed to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy can trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunotherapy, benefiting from its superior spatiotemporal selectivity and non&#8208;invasiveness. However, the practical applications of sonosensitizers are hindered by their low efficacy in killing cancer cells and activating immune responses. Here, two US Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are selected to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Through elaborate regulation of multiple metal/ligand coordination, the systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation, which can be used for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Moreover, Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] can downregulate intracellular glutathione levels that would destroy intracellular redox homeostasis and facilitate reactive oxygen species accumulation. The released tumor&#8208;associated antigens subsequently facilitate dendritic cell maturation within the tumor&#8208;draining lymph node, effectively initiating a T cell&#8208;mediated immune response and thereby bolstering the capacity to identify and combat cancer cells. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultrasmall Enzyodynamic PANoptosis Nano&#8208;Inducers for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy and Lung Metastasis Inhibition</title>

This work reports on the engineering of ultrasmall PANoptosis nano&#8208;inducers for ultrasound&#8208;amplified hepatocellular carcinoma therapy and lung metastasis inhibition through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Addressing the inefficiency of current therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma is an urgent and pressing challenge. PANoptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, presents a dependable strategy for combating cancer by engaging multiple cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). In this study, an ultrasmall Bi2Sn2O7 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;magnified multienzyme&#8208;mimicking properties is designed and engineered as a PANoptosis inducer through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species, finally triggering the activation of PANoptosis process. The role of PANoptosis inducer has been verified by the expression of related proteins, including cleaved Caspase 3, NLRP3, N&#8208;GSDMD, cleaved Caspase 1, p&#8208;MLKL, and RIPK3. The inclusion of external ultrasonic irradiation significantly augments the enzyodynamic therapeutic efficiency. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic efficacy, along with inhibition of lung metastasis, validate the benefits of the Bi2Sn2O7&#8208;mediated PANoptosis pathway. This study not only elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying Bi2Sn2O7 as a PANoptosis inducer, but also offers a novel perspective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Factor&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Precursors Enable On&#8208;Demand Thermoset Degradation and Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversibility of the integrated dynamic bond, controlled by two factors, can be triggered under mild and specific conditions. When this reversibility is deactivated, the resulting network polymers exhibit life&#8208;span stability. Conversely, when the reversibility is activated by applying both control factors, the polymers offer easy and on&#8208;demand degradability and recyclability.








Abstract
Thermosets are well known for their advantages such as high stability and chemical resistance. However, developing sustainable thermosets with degradability and recyclability faces several principal challenges, including reconciling the desired characteristics during service with the recycling and reprocessing properties required at the end of life, establishing efficient methods for large&#8208;scale synthesis, and aligning with current manufacturing process. Here a general strategy is presented for the on&#8208;demand degradation and recycling of thermosets under mild conditions utilizing dynamic precursors with dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled reversibility. Specifically, dynamic triazine crosslinkers are introduced through dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) into the precursor polyols used in polyurethane (PU) synthesis. Upon removal of the catalyst and alcohol, the reversibility of SNAr is deactivated, allowing for the use of standard PU polymerization techniques such as injection molding, casting, and foaming. The resulting cyanurate&#8208;crosslinked PUs maintain high stability and diverse mechanical properties of traditional crosslinked PUs, yet offer the advantage of easy on&#8208;demand depolymerization for recycling by activating the reversibility of SNAr under specific but mild conditions&#8212;a combination of base, alcohol, and mild heat. It is envisioned that this approach, involving the pre&#8208;installation of dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled dynamic crosslinkers, can be broadly applied to current thermosetting plastic manufacturing processes, introducing enhanced&#160;sustainability.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising alternatives for grid energy storage. Understanding and mastering the proton activities in aqueous electrolytes will guide the design of sustainable and long&#8208;lasting aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments on the current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of proton activities and highlights future research directions for aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising solutions for grid energy storage. Compared with their organic counterparts, water&#8208;based electrolytes enable fast transport kinetics, high safety, low cost, and enhanced environmental sustainability. However, the presence of protons in the electrolyte, generated by the spontaneous ionization of water, may compete with the main charge&#8208;storage mechanism, trigger unwanted side reactions, and accelerate the deterioration of the cell performance. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to understand and master the proton activities in aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments&#160;on the following scientific questions: Why are proton activities relevant? What are proton activities? What do&#160;we&#160;know about proton activities in aqueous batteries? How do&#160;we&#160;better understand, control, and utilize proton activities?

         <title>Ultrahigh Pyridinic/Pyrrolic N Enabling N/S Co&#8208;Doped Holey Graphene with Accelerated Kinetics for Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide, which delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclic stability as anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials hold great promise for K&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost, adjustable interlayer spacing, and high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, the narrow interlayer spacing significantly restricts their potassium storage ability. Herein, hierarchical N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene (NSEHG) with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through micro&#8208;explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide (GO). The underlying mechanism of the micro&#8208;explosive exfoliation of GO is revealed. The NSEHG electrode delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1), and robust cyclic stability (0.005% decay per cycle after 4400 cycles at 5 A&#160;g&#8722;1), exceeding most of the previously reported graphene anodes in K&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, the NSEHG electrode exhibits encouraging performances as anodes for Li&#8208;/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled activated carbon||NSEHG potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor can deliver an impressive energy density of 141 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance with 96.1% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work can offer helpful fundamental insights into design and scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Thermodynamic Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional crystallization control strategy by ingenious vapor design is developed for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The target perovskite films exhibit efficient energy transfer and minimized charge loss. Consequently, a series of red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with record peak external quantum efficiency over 32%, along with remarkable half&#8208;lifetime are obtained.








Abstract
Efficient and stable red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) demonstrate promising potential in high&#8208;definition displays and biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been made in device performance, meeting commercial demands remains a challenge in the aspects of long&#8208;term stability and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, an in situ crystallization regulation strategy is developed for optimizing red perovskite films through ingenious vapor design. Mixed vapor containing dimethyl sulfoxide and carbon disulfide (CS2) is incorporated to conventional annealing, which contributes to thermodynamics dominated perovskite crystallization for well&#8208;aligned cascade phase arrangement. Additionally, the perovskite surface defect density is minimized by the CS2 molecule adsorption. Consequently, the target perovskite films exhibit smooth exciton energy transfer, reduced defect density, and blocked ion migration pathways. Leveraging these advantages, spectrally stable red PeLEDs are obtained featuring emission at 668, 656, and 648&#160;nm, which yield record peak EQEs of 30.08%, 32.14%, and 29.04%, along with prolonged half&#8208;lifetimes of 47.7, 60.0, and 43.7&#160;h at the initial luminances of 140, 250, and 270&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for optimizing perovskite crystallization and represents a significant stride toward the commercialization of red PeLEDs.

     alt="Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes via Thermodynamic Crystallization Control"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional crystallization control strategy by ingenious vapor design is developed for preparing high-quality perovskite films. The target perovskite films exhibit efficient energy transfer and minimized charge loss. Consequently, a series of red perovskite light-emitting diodes with record peak external quantum efficiency over 32%, along with remarkable half-lifetime are obtained.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient and stable red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) demonstrate promising potential in high-definition displays and biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been made in device performance, meeting commercial demands remains a challenge in the aspects of long-term stability and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, an in situ crystallization regulation strategy is developed for optimizing red perovskite films through ingenious vapor design. Mixed vapor containing dimethyl sulfoxide and carbon disulfide (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is incorporated to conventional annealing, which contributes to thermodynamics dominated perovskite crystallization for well-aligned cascade phase arrangement. Additionally, the perovskite surface defect density is minimized by the CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule adsorption. Consequently, the target perovskite films exhibit smooth exciton energy transfer, reduced defect density, and blocked ion migration pathways. Leveraging these advantages, spectrally stable red PeLEDs are obtained featuring emission at 668, 656, and 648&#160;nm, which yield record peak EQEs of 30.08%, 32.14%, and 29.04%, along with prolonged half-lifetimes of 47.7, 60.0, and 43.7&#160;h at the initial luminances of 140, 250, and 270&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for optimizing perovskite crystallization and represents a significant stride toward the commercialization of red PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Structure of Electron Interactions in High&#8208;entropy Oxide Nanoparticles for Active Electrocatalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles are dispersed on carbon support via a fast Joule heating approach, enabling the long&#8208;range electron interactions for bridging adsorption with CO2 to promote the reduction conversion.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5&#160;nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low&#8208;symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4, demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO2RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (&#8722;0.3 to &#8722;1.6&#160;V), and sustained stability for over100&#160;h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 achieves a current density of 350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining good stability for 24&#160;h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor&#8211;acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO2 adsorption status for eCO2RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.

This article comprehensively reviews the principles and performance optimization strategies of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics from materials to devices and points out the current research challenges and future development directions of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendless and high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics play a significant role in exploring sustainable clean energy. Among them, AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics, benefiting from the disorder in the cation sublattice and interface scattering from secondary phases of Ag2Te and Sb2Te3, exhibit low thermal conductivity and a maximum figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit ZT of 2.6 at 573 K via optimizing electrical properties and addressing phase transition issues. Therefore, AgSbTe2 shows considerable potential as a promising medium&#8208;temperature thermoelectric material. Additionally, with the increasing demands for device integration and portability in the information age, the research on flexible and wearable AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics aligns with contemporary development needs, leading to a growing number of research findings. This work provides a detailed and timely review of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics from materials to devices. Principles and performance optimization strategies are highlighted for the thermoelectric performance enhancement in AgSbTe2. The current challenges and future research directions of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics are pointed out. This review will guide the development of high&#8208;performance AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics for practical applications.

         <title>Flexible Temperature Sensor with High Reproducibility and Wireless Closed&#8208;Loop System for Decoupled Multimodal Health Monitoring and Personalized Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, achieving high reproducibility, more reliable sensitivity, and higher stability; it also has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A textile&#8208;based flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system is designed to monitor health status and autonomously regulate body temperature.








Abstract
Temperature and pulse waves are two fundamental indicators of body health. Specifically, thermoresistive flexible temperature sensors are one of the most applied sensors. However, they suffer from poor reproducibility of resistivity; and decoupling temperature from pressure/strain is still challenging. Besides, autonomous thermoregulation by wearable sensory systems is in high demand, but conventional commercial apparatuses are cumbersome and not suitable for long&#8208;term portable use. Here, a material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, precluding the detriment caused by shape expansion/shrinkage with temperature variation and achieving high reproducibility. The strategy also obtains more reliable sensitivity and higher stability, and the designed thermoresistive fiber has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A smart textile woven by the thermoresistive fiber can decouple temperature and pulse without crosstalk; and a flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system comprising the smart textile, a heating textile, a flexible diminutive control patch, and a smartphone is designed and constructed to monitor health status in real&#8208;time and autonomously regulate body temperature. This work offers a new route to circumvent temperature&#8208;sensitive effects for flexible sensors and new insights for personalized thermoregulation.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optically Configurable Synaptic Transistors With Cluster&#8208;Induced Photoactive Dielectric Layer for Visual Simulation and Biomotor Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating poly (1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive can be employed as dielectric layer to develop electro&#8208;optically configurable transistors. By enhancing photoactivity of POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing, devices realize multiwavelength optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3&#8208;bits. The optical synaptic plasticity, biologically degradable dielectrics, and motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device open new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics and bioengineering.








Abstract
The integration of visual simulation and biorehabilitation devices promises great applications for sustainable electronics, on&#8208;demand integration and neuroscience. However, achieving a multifunctional synergistic biomimetic system with tunable optoelectronic properties at the individual device level remains a challenge. Here, an electro&#8208;optically configurable transistor employing conjugated&#8208;polymer as semiconductor layer and an insulating polymer (poly(1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate) (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive properties as dielectric layer is shown. These devices realize adeptly transition from electrical to optical synapses, featuring multiwavelength and multilevel optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3 bits. Utilizing enhanced optical memory, the images learning and memory function for visual simulation are achieved. Benefiting from rapid electrical response akin to biological muscle activation, increased actuation occurs under increased stimulus frequency of gate voltage. Additionally, the transistor on POC substrate can be effectively degraded in NaOH solution due to degradation of POC. Pioneeringly, the electro&#8208;optically configurability stems from light absorption and photoluminescence of the aggregation cluster in POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing. The enhancement of optical synaptic plasticity and integration of motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device opens new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics, synaptic computing, and bioengineering.

         <title>Multifunctional Scavenger Boosts Cathode Interfacial Stability with Reduced Water Footprint for Direct Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined direct recycling process to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. This intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The burgeoning accumulation of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a byproduct from the widespread adoption of portable electronics and electric vehicles, necessitates efficient recycling strategies. Direct recycling represents a promising strategy to maximize the value of LIB waste and minimize harmful environmental outcomes. However, current efforts to large&#8208;scale direct recycling face challenges stemming from heterophase residues (e.g., Li2CO3, LiOH) in the recycled products and uncontrolled interfacial instability, often requiring repeated washing that generates significant wastewater. Here, a refined direct recycling process is proposed to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating that stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. The findings reveal that the conductive coating also prevents direct contact between contaminants and the cathode surface, thus improving the ambient storage stability. By eliminating the need for extensive washing, this intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

         <title>Silicon Clathrate&#8208;Supported Catalysts with Low Work Functions for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamond&#8208;type Si has a high work function, but here it is shown how this can be drastically lowered in its alkali clathrate form K7.5Si46. These group 14 clathrates are previously examined for thermoelectric and photovoltaic properties, but the low work function enables it to function as an effective catalyst support for ammonia synthesis, thus expanding material applications.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;type silicon has a work function of &#8776;4.8&#160;eV, and conventional n&#8208; or p&#8208;type doping modifies the value only between 4.6 and 5.05&#160;eV. Here, it is shown that the alkali clathrates AxSi46 have substantially lower work functions approaching 2.6&#160;eV, with clear trends between alkali electropositivity and clathrate cage size. The low work function enables alkali clathrates such as K8Si46 to be effective Haber&#8208;Bosch catalyst supports for NH3 synthesis. The catalytic properties of Si, Ge, and Sn&#8208;based clathrates are investigated while supporting Fe and Ru on the surface. The activity largely scales with the work function, and low activation energies below 60&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 are observed due to strong electron donation effects from the support. Ru metal and Sn clathrates seem to be unsuitable for stability issues. Compared to other similar hydride/electride catalysts, the simple structure and composition combined with stability in air/water make a systematic study of these clathrates possible and open the door to other electron&#8208;rich Zintl phases and related intermetallics as low&#8208;work function materials suitable for catalysis. The observed low work function may also have implications for other existing electronic applications.

         <title>General Design of Aligned&#8208;Channel Porous Carbon Electrodes for Efficient High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Gas&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aligned&#8208;channel carbon electrodes by a general design strategy are developed, which not only facilitates the fast accessibility of liquid reactants and the timely detachment of gaseous products but also possesses a large pore area to accommodate abundant active sites, thus achieving high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalysis at high current densities, including urea oxidation reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Gas&#8208;evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self&#8208;standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.360&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam&#8208;based counterpart and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu&#948;+ Sites Within MnO2 for Superior Urea Electro&#8208;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 (Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual site (Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+) achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and urea yield rate in electrocatalytic CO2/NO3&#8722; reduction with a highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Mechanistic studies reveal that such stabilized Cu&#948;+ sites kinetically lower the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between NO3&#8208; and CO2 has emerged as a sustainable route for urea production. However, identifying catalytic active sites and designing efficient electrocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, the synthesis of Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 nanotube (denoted as Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual sites is reported. Compared with pure MnO2, Cu&#948;+ doping can effectively enhance urea production performance in the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8208;. Thus, Cu&#8208;MnO2 catalyst exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 54.7% and the highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Remarkably, the urea yield rate remains over 78&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 across a wide potential range. Further experimental and theoretical results elucidate the unique role of Cu&#8208;MnO2 solid&#8208;solution for stabilizing Cu&#948;+ sites in Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. This thermodynamically promotes urea formation and kinetically lowers the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.

However, identifying catalytic active sites and designing efficient electrocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, the synthesis of Cu-doped MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotube (denoted as Cu-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;-oxygen vacancies (O&lt;sub&gt;vs&lt;/sub&gt;)-Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; dual sites is reported. Compared with pure MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; doping can effectively enhance urea production performance in the co-reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, Cu-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 54.7% and the highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell. Remarkably, the urea yield rate remains over 78&#160;mmol&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; across a wide potential range. Further experimental and theoretical results elucidate the unique role of Cu-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solid-solution for stabilizing Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites in Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;vs&lt;/sub&gt;-Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. This thermodynamically promotes urea formation and kinetically lowers the energy barrier of C-N coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Tunable Instantaneous Carbon Rearrangement Enables Low&#8208;Working&#8208;Potential Hard Carbon Toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable hard carbon (HC) with precisely tunable graphitic micro&#8208;domains and closed nanopores is achieved through a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically controlled synthesis. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the optimal sample exhibiting a plateau capacity of 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the assembled HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery is therefore increased by 20.7%.








Abstract
As the preferred anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon (HC) confronts significant obstacles in providing a long and dominant low&#8208;voltage plateau to boost the output energy density of full batteries. The critical challenge lies in precisely enhancing the local graphitization degree to minimize Na+ ad&#8208;/chemisorption, while effectively controlling the growth of internal closed nanopores to maximize Na+ filling. Unfortunately, traditional high&#8208;temperature preparation methods struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Herein, a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is proposed that enables the creation of metastable HCs with precisely tunable carbon phases and low discharge/charge voltage plateaus. By optimizing the temperature and width of thermal pulses, the high&#8208;throughput screened HCs are characterized by short&#8208;range ordered graphitic micro&#8208;domains that possess accurate crystallite width and height, as well as appropriately&#8208;sized closed nanopores. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the best sample exhibiting a high plateau capacity of up to 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery can therefore be increased by 20.7%. Machine learning study explicitly unveils the &#8220;carbon phase evolution&#8722;electrochemistry&#8221; relationship. This work promises disruptive changes to the synthesis, optimization, and commercialization of HC anodes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Sequential Targeted Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Self&#8208;Assembly Supramolecular Nanofibers to Attenuate Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the intervertebral disc degeneration. Enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly supramolecular nanofibers (Fbp&#8208;GFFYPLGLAG(E)nRGD) are developed to target the overexpression of two crucial enzymes, MMP&#8208;2 and COX&#8208;2. These nanofibers can effectively block the synergistic effect of the inflammatory cascade and aging&#8208;related secretion phenotype and reduce the extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging cell accumulation. Finally, it can mitigate the progression of disc degeneration.








Abstract
As an age&#8208;related disease, intervertebral disc degeneration is closely related to inflammation and aging. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the degradation of intervertebral disc. Blocking this synergy reduces disc extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging. In this study, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers with sequential targeting functions are constructed through intelligent response, hydrophilicity, and in situ self&#8208;assembly empowerment of flurbiprofen. The peptide precursor responds to the cleavage of overexpressed MMP&#8208;2 in the degenerative intervertebral disc microenvironment (intracellular and extracellular), resulting in the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers that enable the on&#8208;demand release of flurbiprofen and COX&#8208;2 response. In vitro, Comp. 1 (Flurbiprofen&#8208;GFFYPLGLAGEEEERGD) reduces the expression of inflammation&#8208;related genes and proteins and the polarization of M1 macrophages by competitively inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins COL&#8208;2 and aggrecan. Additionally, it can reduce the expression of Senescence&#8208;Associated Secretory Phenotype and DNA damage in aged nucleus pulposus cells and promote the recovery of proliferation and cell cycle. In vivo, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers delay intervertebral disc degeneration by inhibiting inflammation and preventing the accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, the sequentially targeted self&#8208;assembled drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers can delay intervertebral disc degeneration by blocking the synergistic effect of inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence.

         <title>Chain Friction and Lubrication Balanced Ultra&#8208;Tough Polyacrylates With Wide&#8208;Span Switchable Stiffness for Strain&#8208;Programmable Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously incorporating long alkyl chains and nano&#8208;eutectics in the polymer matrix achieves polyacrylate composites with ultra&#8208;stretchability and high resilience. These properties, along with a wide&#8208;span stiffness variation triggered by the room&#8208;temperature glass transition, enable polyacrylate composites to exhibit biomimetic and time&#8208; or temperature&#8208;programmable deformations. Furthermore, polyacrylate composite artificial muscles can transform thermal energy into mechanical energy to perform work.








Abstract
Natural mollusks perform complex mechanical actions through reversible large&#8208;strain deformation and stiffness switching, which are challenging to achieve simultaneously in synthetic materials. Herein, it is shown that a set of polyacrylates designed according to a chain friction and lubrication balanced strategy shows&#160;ultra&#8208;stretchability (&#955; up to 324), high resilience (near 100% recovery at strain &#8805; 100), and wide&#8208;span stiffness switching (up to 2073 times). The typical emulsion polymerization method and casting technique are adopted to fabricate the polyacrylate films. Quaternary ammonium surfactants are used as the emulsifier and reserved in the polymer matrix to enhance the chain segment lubrication with their long alkyl group but improve the whole chain friction through the formation of nano&#8208;eutectics. These polyacrylates undergo multimodal mechanical responses, including temperature&#8208; or time&#8208;programmed deformation and load&#8208;bearing like artificial muscles. This molecular design principle and synthetic method provide a robust platform for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough polymers for soft robots with multiple customized functions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Interfacial Layer Enabled by Gating&#8208;Shielding Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode with beyond 9000&#160;h cycling lifespan is developed by introducing trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium as electrolyte additives. The additives enable dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer with a gating effect from pantothenate molecular layer for switching off active water while selectively transporting target Zn2+, and a dynamically electrostatic shielding effect from Ca2+ cations for suppressing dendrites and side reactions.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale application of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety and environment&#8208;compatible aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) is hindered by Zn dendrite failure and side reactions. Herein, highly reversible ZMBs are obtained by addition of trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium additives to engineer a dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer, which is enabled by a bioinspired gating effect for excluding competitive free water near Zn surface due to the trapping and immobilization of water by hydroxyl groups, and guiding target Zn2+ transport across interface through carboxyl groups of pantothenate anions, as well as a dynamic electrostatic shielding effect around Zn protuberances from Ca2+ cations to ensure uniform Zn2+ deposition. In consequence, interfacial side reactions are perfectly inhibited owing to reduced water molecules reaching Zn surface, and the uniform and compact deposition of Zn2+ is achieved due to promoted Zn2+ transport and deposition kinetics. The ultra&#8208;stable symmetric cells with beyond 9000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and over 5000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, are amazingly realized. The regulated&#8208;electrolyte demonstrates high compatibility with verified cathodes for stable full cells. This work opens a brand&#8208;new pathway to regulate Zn/electrolyte interface to promise reversible ZMBs.

Herein, highly reversible ZMBs are obtained by addition of trace D-pantothenate calcium additives to engineer a dual-functional interfacial layer, which is enabled by a bioinspired gating effect for excluding competitive free water near Zn surface due to the trapping and immobilization of water by hydroxyl groups, and guiding target Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport across interface through carboxyl groups of pantothenate anions, as well as a dynamic electrostatic shielding effect around Zn protuberances from Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations to ensure uniform Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition. In consequence, interfacial side reactions are perfectly inhibited owing to reduced water molecules reaching Zn surface, and the uniform and compact deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved due to promoted Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and deposition kinetics. The ultra-stable symmetric cells with beyond 9000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and over 5000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, are amazingly realized. The regulated-electrolyte demonstrates high compatibility with verified cathodes for stable full cells. This work opens a brand-new pathway to regulate Zn/electrolyte interface to promise reversible ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Intranasal Nanovaccines as Antivirals for Respiratory Syncytial Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intranasal vaccines are fabricated to target the Respiratory Syncytial Virus and promote the immunological response by controlling the composition, size, and chirality of the nanostructures.








Abstract
This study aimed to develop an intranasal nanovaccine by combining chiral nanoparticles with the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein) to create L&#8208;nanovaccine (L&#8208;Vac). The results showed that L&#8208;NPs increased antigen attachment in the nasal cavity by 3.83 times and prolonged its retention time to 72&#160;h. In vivo experimental data demonstrated that the intranasal immunization with L&#8208;Vac induced a 4.86&#8208;fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) secretion in the upper respiratory tract, a 1.85&#8208;fold increase in the lower respiratory tract, and a 20.61&#8208;fold increase in RSV&#8208;specific immunoglobin G (IgG) titer levels in serum, compared with the commercial Alum Vac, while the neutralizing activity against the RSV authentic virus is 1.66&#8208;fold higher. The mechanistic investigation revealed that L&#8208;Vac activated the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in nasal epithelial cells (NECs), in turn increasing the expression levels of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) and C&#8211;C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) by 1.67&#8208;fold and 3.46&#8208;fold, respectively, through the downstream nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, CCL20 recruited dendritic cells (DCs) and L&#8208;Vac activated the Toll&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway in DCs, promoting IL&#8208;6 expression and DCs maturation, and boosted sIgA production and T&#8208;cell responses. The findings suggested that L&#8208; Vac may serve as a candidate for the development of intranasal medicine against various types of respiratory infections.

         <title>The Effect of Organic Semiconductor Electron Affinity on Preventing Parasitic Oxidation Reactions Limiting Performance of n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type electrochemical transistors generally exhibit lower performance than their p&#8208;type analogs. The origins of the lower charge carrier mobility in electron&#8208;transporting organic semiconducting polymers are explored and observed that parasitic reactions involving ambient oxygen are a contributing factor. It is shown that a molecular design strategy to increase the polymer electron affinity successfully eliminates these reactions.








Abstract
A key challenge in the development of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting materials (OMIEC) for high performance electrochemical transistors is their stable performance in ambient. When operating in aqueous electrolyte, potential reactions of the electrochemically injected electrons with air and water could hinder their persistence, leading to a reduction in charge transport. Here, the impact of deepening the LUMO energy level of a series of electron&#8208;transporting semiconducting polymers is evaluated, and subsequently rendering the most common oxidation processes of electron polarons thermodynamically unfavorable, on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) performance. Employing time resolved spectroelectrochemistry with three analogous polymers having varying electron affinities (EA), it is found that an EA below the thermodynamic threshold for oxidation of its electron polarons by oxygen significantly improves electron transport and lifetime in air. A polymer with a sufficiently large EA and subsequent thermodynamically unfavorable oxidation of electron polarons is reported, which is used as the semiconducting layer in an OECT, in its neutral and N&#8208;DMBI doped form, resulting in an excellent and air&#8208;stable OECT performance. These results show a general design methodology to avoid detrimental parasitic reactions under ambient conditions, and the benefits that arise in electrical performance.

         <title>Reviving Sodium Tunnel Oxide Cathodes Based on Structural Modulation and Sodium Compensation Strategy Toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Cylindrical Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to slove the problems of surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity in the tunnel oxide cathode material (Na0.44MnO2). In addition, Prussian blue analog (PBA)&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to construct practical sodium&#8208;ion cylindrical battery with hard carbon anodes for the first time, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.








Abstract
As a typical tunnel oxide, Na0.44MnO2 features excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding structural stability, making it a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from undesirable challenges such as surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity. Herein, an internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is adopted by replacing part of the Mn with Ti to optimize the bulk phase and construct a Ti&#8208;containing epitaxial stabilization layer, resulting in reduced surface residual alkali, excellent Na+ transport kinetics and improved water/air stability. Specifically, the Na0.44Mn0.85Ti0.15O2 using water&#8208;soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder can realize a capacity retention rate of 94.30% after 1,000 cycles at 2C, and excellent stability is further verified in kilogram large&#8208;up applications. In addition, taking advantage of the rich Na content in Prussian blue analog (PBA), PBA&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to compensate for the insufficient Na in the tunnel oxide and are matched with hard carbon to achieve the preparation of coin full cell and 18650 cylindrical battery with satisfactory electrochemical performance. This work enables the application of tunnel oxides cathode for SIBs in 18650 cylindrical batteries for the first time and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Efficient Permeable Monolithic Hybrid Tribo&#8208;Piezo&#8208;Electromagnetic Nanogenerator Based on Topological&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly efficient permeable and stretchable monolithic hybrid tribo&#8208;piezo&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin is developed, by adopting a fairly facile and scalable design of two&#8208;layer porous topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers sandwiching liquid metal networks. It works not only as an efficient epidermal power source but also as a multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Escalating energy demands of self&#8208;independent on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high&#8208;efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin (TPEG&#8208;skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two&#8208;layer topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG&#8208;skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole&#8208;body self&#8208;powered sensors. Topological insulators with conductive surface states supply notably enhanced triboelectric and piezoelectric effects, endowing TPEG&#8208;skin with a 288&#160;V output voltage (10 N, 4&#160;Hz), &#8764;3 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Liquid metal meshes serve as breathable electrodes and extract ambient electromagnetic pollution (&#177;60&#160;V, &#177;1.6&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2). TPEG&#8208;skin implements self&#8208;powered physiological and body motion monitoring and system&#8208;level human&#8208;machine interactions. This study provides compatible energy strategies for on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics with high power density, monolithic device integration, and multifunctionality.

         <title>Targeting the Labile Iron Pool with Engineered DFO Nanosheets to Inhibit Ferroptosis for Parkinson's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered DFO&#8208;nanosheets based multifunctional nanoregulator with sequential targeting and ROS&#8208;responsive release property is developed for targeting ferroptosis mitigate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease through regulating labile iron pool&#8208;mediated iron metabolism, suppressing lipid peroxidation&#8208;mediated reduction of GPX4 expression, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction.








Abstract
Ferroptosis in neurons is considered one of the key factors that induces Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by excessive iron accumulation in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). The iron ions released from the LIP lead to the aberrant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger ferroptosis and exacerbate PD progression. Herein, a pioneering design of multifunctional nanoregulator deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;integrated nanosheets (BDPR NSs) is presented that target the LIP to restrict ferroptosis and protect against PD. The BDPR NSs are constructed by incorporating a brain&#8208;targeting peptide and DFO into polydopamine&#8208;modified black phosphorus nanosheets. These BDPR NSs can sequester free iron ions, thereby ameliorating LIP overload and regulating iron metabolism. Furthermore, the BDPR NSs can decrease lipid peroxidation generation by mitigating ROS accumulation. More importantly, BDPR NSs can specifically accumulate in the mitochondria to suppress ROS generation and decrease mitochondrial iron accumulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the BDPR NSs highly efficiently mitigated dopaminergic neuronloss and its associated behavioral disorders by modulating the LIP and inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, the BDPR&#8208;based nanovectors holds promise as a potential avenue for advancing PD therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedle Array Patches for Tunable and Versatile Intradermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) have unique geometries capable of delivering both solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;state cargo on a single platform. This technology enables tunable delivery kinetics from the order of minutes to hours for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. The modularity introduced by L&#8208;MAPs opens up drug delivery profiles for multiple payloads while enabling ease of administration.








Abstract
Using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing, a novel class of microneedle array patches (MAPs) is introduced, called latticed MAPs (L&#8208;MAPs). Unlike most MAPs which are composed of either solid structures or hollow needles, L&#8208;MAPs incorporate tapered struts that form hollow cells capable of trapping liquid droplets. The lattice&#160;structures can also be coated with traditional viscous coating formulations, enabling both liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state cargo delivery, on a single patch. Here, a library of 43 L&#8208;MAP designs is generated and in&#8208;silico modeling is used to down&#8208;select optimal geometries for further characterization. Compared to traditionally molded and solid&#8208;coated MAPs, L&#8208;MAPs can load more cargo with fewer needles per patch, enhancing cargo loading and drug delivery capabilities. Further, L&#8208;MAP cargo release kinetics into the skin can be tuned based on formulation and needle geometry. In this work, the utility of L&#8208;MAPs as a platform is demonstrated for the delivery of small molecules, mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and solid&#8208;state ovalbumin protein. In addition, the production of programmable L&#8208;MAPs is demonstrated with tunable&#160;cargo release profiles, enabled by combining needle geometries on a single patch.

         <title>Identifying Highly Active and Selective Cobalt X&#8208;Ides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of Co X&#8208;ides are adopted as the models to investigate the catalytic behavior differences toward the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ). The Co3O4 undergoes an ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway and presents the best conversion and selectivity toward ECHQ. The key enhanced mechanism of Co3O4 toward ECHQ is demonstrated to be closely&#160;related to its favorable interfacial water adsorption and the spontaneous desorption of product.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant Co X&#8208;ides are emerging as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ), yet challenging due to the limited fundamental understanding of ECHQ mechanism on Co X&#8208;ides. This work identifies the catalytic performance differences of Co X&#8208;ides in ECHQ and provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of ECHQ. Among selected Co X&#8208;ides, the Co3O4 presents the best ECHQ performance with a high conversion of 98.2% and 100% selectivity at ambient conditions. The Co3O4 sites present a higher proportion of 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water at the interface than other Co X&#8208;ides at a low negative potential, which enhances the kinetics of subsequent water dissociation to produce H*. An ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway on Co3O4 surface with a spontaneous desorption of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline is demonstrated through operando tracing and theoretical calculations. In comparison, the Co9S8 sites display the lowest ECHQ performance due to the high thermodynamic barrier in the H* formation step, which suppresses subsequent hydrogenation; while the ECHQ on Co(OH)F and CoP sites undergo the 1,2,3,4&#8208; and 4,3/1,2&#8208;H* addition pathway respectively with the high desorption barriers and thus low conversion of quinoline. Moreover, the Co3O4 presents a wide substrate scope and allows excellent conversion of other quinoline derivatives and N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Cu/CuxO nanoparticles on graphdiyne (Cu/CuxO/GDY) with tandem catalytic mechanism is successfully designed. The Cu/CuxO/GDY catalyst exhibits high NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), revealing the enormous potentials of graphdiyne as a tandem catalyst to improve NO3RR kinetics and providing a new direction for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity toward NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction is presented. A high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst is achieved. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>On the Topotactic Phase Transition Achieving Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of many new complex oxides involves topotactic reduction&#8212;a process used to alter electronic structure through the removal of specific oxygen ions. The reaction can be damaging to the crystal lattice, however, and little is known about the reduction process in ultrathin films. Li et&#160;al. observed the reaction in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray methods to probe formation of the superconducting nickelate, Nd0.8 Sr0.2NiO2, providing key insights into the nature of the phase transition.








Abstract
Topotactic reduction is critical to a wealth of phase transitions of current interest, including synthesis of the superconducting nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, reduced from the initial Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Due to the highly sensitive and often damaging nature of the topotactic reduction, however, only a handful of research groups have been able to reproduce the superconductivity results. A series of in situ synchrotron&#8208;based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 / SrTiO3 (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square&#8208;planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Structuring of Silica&#8208;Based Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Multicomponent Glasses with Adjustable Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically curable silicate&#8208;based nanocomposites containing photoreactive precursors allow transparent multicomponent glasses with adjustable properties to be fabricated. After lithographic structuring, the doped nanocomposites are thermally debinded and sintered in order to achieve full densification. This enables the production of complex structured, transparent multicomponent glasses that are difficult to realize using conventional methods.








Abstract
Silicate&#8208;based multicomponent glasses are of high interest for technical applications due to their tailored properties, such as an adaptable refractive index or coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the production of complex structured parts is associated with high effort, since glass components are usually shaped from high&#8208;temperature melts with subsequent mechanical or chemical postprocessing. Here for the first time the fabrication of binary and ternary multicomponent glasses using doped nanocomposites based on silica nanoparticles and photocurable metal oxide precursors as part of the binder matrix is presented. The doped nanocomposites are structured in high resolution using UV&#8208;casting and additive manufacturing techniques, such as stereolithography and two&#8208;photon lithography. Subsequently, the composites are thermally converted into transparent glass. By incorporating titanium oxide, germanium oxide, or zirconium dioxide into the silicate glass network, multicomponent glasses are fabricated with an adjustable refractive index nD between 1.4584&#8211;1.4832 and an Abbe number V of 53.85&#8211;61.13. It is further demonstrated that by incorporating 7&#160;wt% titanium oxide, glasses with ultralow thermal expansion can be fabricated with so far unseen complexity. These novel materials enable for the first time high&#8208;precision lithographic structuring of multicomponent silica glasses with applications from optics and photonics, semiconductors as well as sensors.

         <title>Constructing Multiscale Fibrous Morphology to Achieve 20% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Mixing High and Low Molecular Weight D18</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIX&#8208;D18, by mixing HW&#8208;D18 (high molecular weight D18) and LW&#8208;D18 (low molecular weight D18), can form multiscale fibrous morphology. The finer nanofibers of HW&#8208;D18 can increase Donor/Acceptor contact, enhancing exciton dissociation and collection efficiency, while the thicker nanofibers of LW&#8208;D18 can improve crystallinity and boost charge transport capability. Ultimately, a efficiency of 20.0% is achieved by MIX&#8208;D18:L8&#8208;BO device.








Abstract
This study underscores the significance of precisely manipulating the morphology of the active layer in organic solar cells (OSCs). By blending polymer donors of D18 with varying molecular weights, a multiscale interpenetrating fiber network structure within the active layer is successfully created. The introduction of 10% low molecular weight D18 (LW&#8208;D18) into high molecular weight D18 (HW&#8208;D18) produces MIX&#8208;D18, which exhibits an extended exciton diffusion distance and orderly molecular stacking. Devices utilizing MIX&#8208;D18 demonstrate superior electron and hole transport, improves exciton dissociation, enhances charge collection efficiency, and reduces trap&#8208;assisted recombination compared to the other two materials. Through the use of the nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% is achieved. This methodology, which integrates the favorable attributes of high and low molecular weight polymers, opens a new avenue for enhancing the performance of OSCs.

         <title>Overcoming Chemical and Mechanical Instabilities in Lithium Metal Anodes with Sustainable and Eco&#8208;Friendly Artificial SEI Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical and chemical regulation leads to stabilization of lithium anode and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer&#160;with eco&#8208;friendly process from synthesis to disposal.








Abstract
Construction of a robust artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer has proposed an effective strategy to overcome the instability of the lithium (Li). However, existing artificial SEI layers inadequately controlled ion distribution, leading to dendritic growth and penetration. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the manufacturing process and materials of the artificial layer is often overlooked. In this work, a chemically and physically reinforced membrane (C&#8208;Li@P) composed of the biocompatible Li+ coordinated carboxymethyl guar gum (CMGG) and polyacrylamide (PAM) polymers serves as an artificial SEI membrane for dendrite&#8208;free Li. This membrane with hollow channels not only directs ion flux along the interspace of fibers, fostering uniform Li plating but also induces a desirable interface chemistry. Consequently, artificial SEI membrane&#8208;covered Li exhibits stable electrochemical plating/stripping reactions, surpassing the cycle life of &#8776;750% of bare Li. It demonstrates exceptional capacity retention of &#8776;93.9%, &#8776;88.1%, and &#8776;79.18% in full cells paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) and S cathodes, respectively over 200 cycles at 1 C rate. Additionally, the water&#8208;based green manufacturing and biodegradability of the membrane demonstrated the sustainable development and disposal of electrodes. This work provides a comprehensive framework for the design of an artificial layer chemically and physically regulating dendritic growth.

         <title>3D Soft Architectures for Stretchable Thermoelectric Wearables with Electrical Self&#8208;Healing and Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small&#8208;scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self&#8208;healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 at a low&#8208;temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity. The engineered structure is lighter and effectively maintains the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric semiconductors, thereby resulting in higher output voltage and improved heating and cooling performance. Furthermore, these thermoelectric generators show remarkable damage tolerance, remaining fully functional even after multiple punctures and 2000 stretching cycles at 50% strain. When integrated with a 3D&#8208;printed heatsink, they can power wearable sensors, charge batteries, and illuminate LEDs by scavenging body heat at room temperature, demonstrating their application as self&#8208;sustainable electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small-scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self-healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low-temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity. The engineered structure is lighter and effectively maintains the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric semiconductors, thereby resulting in higher output voltage and improved heating and cooling performance. Furthermore, these thermoelectric generators show remarkable damage tolerance, remaining fully functional even after multiple punctures and 2000 stretching cycles at 50% strain. When integrated with a 3D-printed heatsink, they can power wearable sensors, charge batteries, and illuminate LEDs by scavenging body heat at room temperature, demonstrating their application as self-sustainable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired, Self&#8208;Healing, Highly Effective Fully Polymeric Fire&#8208;Retardant Coatings Enabled by Group Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the multifunctions of mussel's catechol groups, here a pioneering &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy has been proposed to create a waterborne fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating that exhibits self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and superior fire protection for various substrates from polymer foams to steel structures. These results offer a promising design principle for creating high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings.









Abstract
Fire&#8208;retardant coatings represent a universal cost&#8208;effective approach to providing fire protection for various substrates without compromising substrates&#8217; bulk properties. However, it has been attractive yet highly challenging to create waterborne polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coatings combining high&#8208;efficiency, generally strong adhesion, and self&#8208;repairability due to a lack of rational design principles. Inspired by mussel's unique adhesive, self&#8208;healing, and char&#8208;forming mechanisms, herein, a &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy is proposed to realize the combination of self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and high efficiency in a fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating via multiple synergies between catechol, phosphonic, and hydroxyethyl groups. As&#8208;created fire&#8208;retardant coating exhibits a rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ability and strong adhesion to (non)polar substrates due to multiple dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions enabled by these groups. Because these functional groups enable the formation of a robust structurally intact yet slightly expanded char layer upon exposure to flame, a 200&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick such coating can make extremely flammable polystyrene foam very difficult to ignite and self&#8208;extinguishing, which far outperforms previous strategies. Moreover, this coating can provide universal exceptional fire protection for a variety of substrates from polymer foams, and timber, to fabric and steel. This work presents a promising material design principle to create next&#8208;generation sustainable high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings for general fire protection.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by intriguing color changeable ability of natural animals, the design and fabrication of artificial mechanochromic materials capable of changing colors upon stretching or pressing have attracted intense scientific interest. Liquid crystal (LC) is a self&#8208;organized soft matter with anisotropic molecular alignment. Due to the sensitivity to various external stimulations, LC has been considered as an emerging and appealing responsive building block to construct intelligent materials and advanced devices. Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
