         <title>A Generalized Method for High&#8208;Speed Fluorination of Metal Oxides by Spark Plasma Sintering Yields Ta3O7F and TaO2F with High Photocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spark plasma sintering (SPS) allows the solid&#8208;state fluorination of Ta2O5 to TaO2F and Ta3O7F with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) on a minute scale, which reduces the preparation time compared to conventional chemistry by three orders of magnitude. The microstructure of SPS&#8208;prepared TaO2F and Ta3O7F leads to high photocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution from water, whereas TaO2F and Ta3O7F prepared by conventional chemistry are catalytically almost inactive.








Abstract
A general method to carry out the fluorination of metal oxides with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) waste by spark plasma sintering (SPS) on a minute scale with Teflon is reported. The potential of this new approach is highlighted by the following results. i) The tantalum oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are obtained from plastic scrap without using toxic or caustic chemicals for fluorination. ii) Short reaction times (minutes rather than days) reduce the process time the energy costs by almost three orders of magnitude. iii) The oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are produced in gram amounts of nanoparticles. Their synthesis can be upscaled to the kg range with industrial sintering equipment. iv) SPS processing changes the catalytic properties: while conventionally prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F show little catalytic activity, SPS&#8208;prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F exhibit high activity for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, reaching photoconversion efficiencies up to 24.7% and applied bias to photoconversion values of 0.86%. This study shows that the materials properties are dictated by the processing which poses new challenges to understand and predict the underlying factors.

         <title>Capturing Cytokines with Advanced Materials: A Potential Strategy to Tackle COVID&#8208;19 Cytokine Storm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology, emerging biomaterials hold great potential to provide better solutions for COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases. By reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytokine neutralization systems and highlighting the promising technology development, this work intends to spark further research and development activity in this critical research area.








Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has caused great impact on the global economy and people's daily life. In the clinic, most patients with COVID&#8208;19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection&#8208;induced cytokine release syndrome (the so&#8208;called &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID&#8208;19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose&#8208;limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody&#8208;based and broad&#8208;spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized. It is anticipated that this work will provide insights on the development of novel therapeutics toward efficacious management of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Surface Self&#8208;Organization for Nanoscale Polygonal Morphology on Germanium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy and single&#8208;step method to manipulate the morphology of circular nanoholes via ion beam irradiation is presented. Through nanoscale control over self&#8208;organization process dynamics on the (100) surface of germanium, polygonal structures such as squares, triangles, and hexagons are realized. Highly periodic and protruding nanoscale&#8208;polygons indicate potential applications toward hierarchical and 3D nanostructures for multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
The evolution of polygonal&#8208;shaped nanoholes on the (100) surface of germanium, aided by focused ion beam induced self&#8208;organization, is presented. The energetic beam of ions creates a viscous phase which, at a thermodynamical minimum, leads to surface self&#8208;organization. A directed viscous&#8208;flow along the predefined nanoholes provides well&#8208;ordered polygonal nanostructures, ranging from triangles to hexagons and octagons, as desired. The amorphization exhibiting a confined viscous&#8208;flow at the walls of nanoholes is attributed to the localized melting zones induced by site&#8208;specific thermal spikes during ion irradiation, as revealed by microscopy and molecular dynamics studies. This leads to a local self&#8208;organization in the vicinity of each circular nanohole via a viscous&#8208;fingering process at the nanoscale. Such controlled self&#8208;organization, with the help of a predefined scanning grid, transforms the circular holes into the desired polygonal shape. The present morphology manipulation promises to surmount the barriers concerning the size reduction efforts in the field of nanofabrication.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Memristive Materials for Artificial Synapses and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, as well as recent developments of memristive materials and devices that emulate synaptic functions based on electric, magnetic, and optical stimulations are highlighted.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing holds promise for building next&#8208;generation intelligent systems in a more energy&#8208;efficient way than the conventional von Neumann computing architecture. Memristive hardware, which mimics biological neurons and synapses, offers high&#8208;speed operation and low power consumption, enabling energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient, brain&#8208;inspired computing. Here, recent advances in memristive materials and strategies that emulate synaptic functions for neuromorphic computing are highlighted. The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, which can be mimicked by memristive devices, are presented. Besides device structures and operation with different external stimuli such as electric, magnetic, and optical fields, how memristive materials with a rich variety of underlying physical mechanisms can allow fast, reliable, and low&#8208;power neuromorphic applications is also discussed. Finally, device requirements are examined and a perspective on challenges in developing memristive materials for device engineering and computing science is given.

         <title>Directional Modulation of Exciton Emission Using Single Dielectric Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly miniaturized platform for the control of emission is explored based on individual subwavelength silicon nanospheres. Simultaneous modulation of the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is demonstrated with controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios. A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance.








Abstract
Coupling emitters with nanoresonators is an effective strategy to control light emission at the subwavelength scale with high efficiency. Low&#8208;loss dielectric nanoantennas hold particular promise for this purpose, owing to their strong Mie resonances. Herein, a highly miniaturized platform is explored for the control of emission based on individual subwavelength Si nanospheres (SiNSs) to modulate the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance. Controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios are experimentally validated in 532&#160;nm laser excitation and 635&#160;nm exciton emission from a monolayer WS2.

     alt="Directional Modulation of Exciton Emission Using Single Dielectric Nanospheres"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly miniaturized platform for the control of emission is explored based on individual subwavelength silicon nanospheres. Simultaneous modulation of the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is demonstrated with controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios. A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling emitters with nanoresonators is an effective strategy to control light emission at the subwavelength scale with high efficiency. Low&#8208;loss dielectric nanoantennas hold particular promise for this purpose, owing to their strong Mie resonances. Herein, a highly miniaturized platform is explored for the control of emission based on individual subwavelength Si nanospheres (SiNSs) to modulate the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance. Controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios are experimentally validated in 532&#160;nm laser excitation and 635&#160;nm exciton emission from a monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Versatile light emission control is achieved for different emitters and excitation wavelengths, benefiting from the facile size control and isotropic shape of SiNSs. Simultaneous modulation of excitation and emission via a single SiNS at visible wavelengths significantly improves the efficiency and directionality of TMD exciton emission and leads to the potential of multifunctional integrated photonics. Overall, the work opens promising opportunities for nanophotonics and polaritonic systems, enabling efficient manipulation, enhancement, and reconfigurability of light&#8211;matter interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conversion of Waste Plastics into Value&#8208;Added Carbonaceous Fuels under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies including solar&#8208;driven conversion, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion, and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion are developed for converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into value&#8208;added fuels under mild conditions.








Abstract
Owing to the extremely difficult breakage of the adamant cross&#8208;linked structures, converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into valuable fuels usually demands rigorous conditions, wherein the required high temperature and pressure is inevitably energy&#8208;wasting and environment&#8208;polluting. Given this aspect, herein, the recent achievements in the conversion of plastics into value&#8208;added carbonaceous fuels under mild conditions are summarized. In detail, solar&#8208;driven conversion of commercial plastics into liquid fuels in alkaline solutions or pure water at ambient temperature and pressure are surveyed; also, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol at a mild temperature are emphasized; and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of polyethylene into oils and waxes with the help of a light alkane are reviewed. Finally, other potentially used strategies and in situ characterization technologies in plastics degradation under moderate conditions are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of polyoxometalates (POMs) from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas, including molecular&#8208;level electronic devices, solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven energy generation, conversion and storage systems. Finally, present challenges and the fundamental insights for advanced design and self&#8208;assembly of POM building blocks are also discussed.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a series of molecular metal oxide clusters, which span the two domains of solutes and solid metal oxides. The unique characters of POMs in structure, geometry, and adjustable redox properties have attracted widespread attention in functional material synthesis, catalysis, electronic devices, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This review is focused on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of POMs from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas. First, the advantageous charge transfer behaviors of POMs in molecular&#8208;level electronic devices are summarized. Solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven charge carrier behaviors of POMs in energy generation, conversion and storage systems are also discussed. Finally, present challenges and fundamental insights are discussed as to the advanced design of functional systems based upon POM building blocks for their possible emerging application areas.

         <title>A Systematic Strategy of Combinational Blow for Overcoming Cascade Drug Resistance via NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hydrophobic photothermal conjugated polymer, DAP&#8208;F, is synthesized and utilized to prepare a combined nanoparticle system F&#8211;Pt&#8208;nanoparticles (NPs) with a Pt(IV) prodrug. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser, shows potential for clinical translation in therapy of cancer via systematically overcoming the cascade drug resistance (CDR) of cisplatin.








Abstract
A systematic combination strategy is proposed for overcoming cisplatin resistance using near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered hyperthermia. A new photothermal polymer DAP&#8208;F is complexed with a reduction&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic polymer P1 to form F&#8208;NPs with photothermal effect. Subsequently, to build the final nanosystem F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs, F&#8208;NPs are combined with Pt&#8208;NPs, which are obtained by encapsulating a Pt(IV) prodrug with P1. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm NIR laser, have various effects such as: i) enhancing the cellular membrane permeability to promote the uptake of drugs; ii) activating cisplatin by accelerating the glutathione consumption; iii) increasing the Pt&#8208;DNA adducts formation and possibly the formation of a portion of irreparable Pt&#8208;DNA interstrand crosslinks, thereby inhibiting the repair of DNA. In vitro, it is found that even on cisplatin&#8208;resistant A549DDP cells, the IC50 of F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) is only 7.0 &#215; 10&#8722;6 m Pt mL&#8722;1. In vivo, on a patient&#8208;derived xenograft model of multidrug resistant lung cancer, the efficacy of the F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) treatment group shows a tumor inhibition rate of 94%. Taken together, here, an important perspective of resolving cascade drug resistance with the assistance of mild hyperthermia triggered by NIR light is presented, which can be of great significance for clinic translation.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Based Adaptive Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials play a significant role not only in scientific research but also in industrial production. Herein, the recent progress in the development of liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, and liquid with membranes, along with their structure&#8211;function relationship and applications are discussed and summarized.








Abstract
The development of structural materials that are capable of adapting to a variety of environments, is promising for smart buildings and therefore providing better&#8208;quality living with energy efficiency. One of the tendencies is to increasingly employ liquid phase materials, owing to their spontaneous and dynamic properties. Bridging the gap between dynamic liquid phase and conventional solid materials, liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials (LASMs) have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, which are desired in many applications such as 3D printing, soft robotics, omniphobic surface, microfluidics, multiphase separation, etc. This research news discusses and summarizes the recent progresses made with LASMs, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, as well as liquid with membranes. Besides, the opportunities and challenges are also showcased for promoting the development of LASMs. The authors hope this research news will attract more researchers&#8217; attention to transform the LASMs into more real&#8208;world applications.

Abstract
Efficient storage and conversion of renewable energies is of critical importance to the sustainable growth of human society. With its distinguishing features of high hydrogen content, high energy density, facile storage/transportation, and zero&#8208;carbon emission, ammonia has been recently considered as a promising energy carrier for long&#8208;term and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Under this scenario, the synthesis, storage, and utilization of ammonia are key components for the implementation of ammonia&#8208;mediated energy system. Being different from fossil fuels, renewable energies normally have intermittent and variable nature, and thus pose demands on the improvement of existing technologies and simultaneously the development of alternative methods and materials for ammonia synthesis and storage. The energy release from ammonia in an efficient manner, on the other hand, is vital to achieve a sustainable energy supply and complete the nitrogen circle. Herein, recent advances in the thermal&#8208;, electro&#8208;, plasma&#8208;, and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, ammonia storage or separation, ammonia thermal/electrochemical decomposition and conversion are summarized with the emphasis on the latest developments of new methods and materials (catalysts, electrodes, and sorbents) for these processes. The challenges and potential solutions are discussed.

         <title>Activatable 19F MRI Nanoprobes for Visualization of Biological Targets in Living Subjects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with activatable nanoprobes enables real&#8208;time, deep&#8208;tissue, and background&#8208;free imaging of cells and biomolecules in living subjects. Recent progress on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds as well as present challenges and potential opportunities are discussed, giving more insights into activatable probe design for this emerging and encouraging field.








Abstract
Visualization of biological targets such as crucial cells and biomolecules in living subjects is critical for the studies of important biological processes. Though 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated its power in offering detailed anatomical and pathological information, its capacity for in vivo tracking of biological targets is limited by the high biological background of 1H. 19F distinguishes itself from its competitors as an exceptional complement to 1H in MRI through its high sensitivity, low biological background, and broad chemical shift range. The specificity and sensitivity of 19F MRI can be further boosted with activatable nanoprobes. The advantages of 19F MRI with activatable nanoprobes enable in vivo detection and imaging at the cellular or even molecular level in deep tissues, rendering this technique appealing as a potential solution for visualization of biological targets in living subjects. Here, recent progress over the past decades on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds, as well as present challenges and potential opportunities, are summarized to provide a panoramic prospective for the people who are interested in this emerging and exciting field.

         <title>Single&#8208;Domain Multiferroic Array&#8208;Addressable Terfenol&#8208;D (SMArT) Micromagnets for Programmable Single&#8208;Cell Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terfenol&#8208;D micromagnets exhibit single magnetic domains on par with the size of a single cell &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. These single&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures allow programmable multiferroic modulation of micromagnetic fields to selectively capture and release single&#8208;cells. Smart programmable multiferroic materials lay the groundwork for large&#8208;scale automated single&#8208;cell sorting and enable a broad spectrum of biomedical engineering applications.








Abstract
Programming magnetic fields with microscale control can enable automation at the scale of single cells &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. Most magnetic materials provide a consistent magnetic field over time but the direction or field strength at the microscale is not easily modulated. However, magnetostrictive materials, when coupled with ferroelectric material (i.e., strain&#8208;mediated multiferroics), can undergo magnetization reorientation due to voltage&#8208;induced strain, promising refined control of magnetization at the micrometer&#8208;scale. This work demonstrates the largest single&#8208;domain microstructures (20&#160;&#181;m) of Terfenol&#8208;D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.92), a material that has the highest magnetostrictive strain of any known soft magnetoelastic material. These Terfenol&#8208;D microstructures enable controlled localization of magnetic beads with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Magnetically labeled cells are captured by the field gradients generated from the single&#8208;domain microstructures without an external magnetic field. The magnetic state on these microstructures is switched through voltage&#8208;induced strain, as a result of the strain&#8208;mediated converse magnetoelectric effect, to release individual cells using a multiferroic approach. These electronically addressable micromagnets pave the way for parallelized multiferroics&#8208;based single&#8208;cell sorting under digital control for biotechnology applications.

         <title>Chemical Insights into Interfacial Effects in Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. Strategies toward the fabrication of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces for deep understanding of complicated interfacial effects at the molecular level are highlighted.








Abstract
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. In numerous situations, interfaces created by organic ligands or secondary inorganic components on inorganic nanomaterials induce significant effects to promote their performances. However, it still remains challenging to understand those interfacial effects at the molecular level. Herein, strategies via the design of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces to simplify the investigation of interfacial effects in inorganic nanomaterials are summarized. While atomically precise metal nanoclusters enable &#8220;seeing&#8221; how organic ligands are coordinated on metal surface to create nanoscale metal&#8211;organic interfaces, ultrathin low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials modified with organic ligands make it possible to extract the metal&#8211;organic interface structure from the average signal to investigate how steric and electronic effects enhance catalysis. The molecular mechanisms of the interfacial effects in supported metal catalysts are disclosed by designing two unique structures of supported catalysts. The interfacial engineering approach will be further extended to optimize the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Finally, a perspective on the development of operando characterization techniques is provided to track the dynamic interfacial structures during catalysis.

         <title>Tunable Sponge&#8208;Like Hierarchically Porous Hydrogels with Simultaneously Enhanced Diffusivity and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach is developed to produce hierarchically structured hydrogels with highly interconnected pores, resulting in unprecedented simultaneously enhanced mass transport and mechanical properties. This approach is applied to several polymer systems and is compatible with 3D printing. This universal technique should greatly benefit the fundamental study of cononsolvency and the development of functionalized porous materials with mitigated diffusion limits.








Abstract
Crosslinked polymers and gels are important in soft robotics, solar vapor generation, energy storage, drug delivery, catalysis, and biosensing. However, their attractive mass transport and volume&#8208;changing abilities are diffusion&#8208;limited, requiring miniaturization to avoid slow response. Typical approaches to improving diffusion in hydrogels sacrifice mechanical properties by increasing porosity or limit the total volumetric flux by directionally confining the pores. Despite tremendous efforts, simultaneous enhancement of diffusion and mechanical properties remains a long&#8208;standing challenge hindering broader practical applications of hydrogels. In this work, cononsolvency photopolymerization is developed as a universal approach to overcome this swelling&#8211;mechanical property trade&#8208;off. The as&#8208;synthesized poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel, as an exemplary system, presents a unique open porous network with continuous microchannels, leading to record&#8208;high volumetric (de)swelling speeds, almost an order of magnitude higher than reported previously. This swelling enhancement comes with a simultaneous improvement in Young's modulus and toughness over conventional hydrogels fabricated in pure solvents. The resulting fast mass transport enables in&#8208;air operation of the hydrogel via rapid water replenishment and ultrafast actuation. The method is compatible with 3D printing. The generalizability is demonstrated by extending the technique to poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylamide) and polyacrylamide hydrogels, non&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive polymer systems, validating the present hypothesis that cononsolvency is a generic phenomenon driven by competitive adsorption.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectricity plays a huge role in the development of next&#8208;generation devices. Since the discovery of multiferroic properties in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials, the related magnetoelectric behaviors have been gradually discovered and advanced at a vigorous pace. This brief development of multiferroicity/magnetoelectricity in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials shows the prospect for future development.








Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials, similar to multiferroic oxide compounds, have recently attracted increasing attention because they exhibit diverse architectures, a flexible framework, fascinating physics, and potential magnetoelectric functionalities in novel multifunctional devices such as energy transformation devices, sensors, and information storage systems. Herein, the classification of multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity is briefly outlined and then the recent advances in the multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials, particularly magnetoelectricity and the relevant magnetoelectric mechanisms and their categories are summarized. In addition, a personal perspective and an outlook are provided.

         <title>Widening the Range of Trackable Environmental and Health Pollutants for Li&#8208;Garnet&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8208;based electrochemical sensor, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide, are presented. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, reactions involved, and control over the interface sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures and phase stability provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants with fast response.








Abstract
Classic chemical sensors integrated in phones, vehicles, and industrial plants monitor the levels of humidity or carbonaceous/oxygen species to track environmental changes. Current projections for the next two decades indicate the strong need to increase the ability of sensors to sense a wider range of chemicals for future electronics not only to continue monitoring environmental changes but also to ensure the health and safety of humans. To achieve this goal, more chemical sensing principles and hardware must be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the specific electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based electrochemical sensor is provided, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide (SO2). This work extends the prime use of LLZO as a battery component as well as the range of trackable pollutants for potential future sensor&#8208;noses. Novel composite sensing&#8208;electrode designs using LLZO&#8208;based porous scaffolds are employed to define a high number of reaction sites, and successfully track SO2 at the dangerous levels of 0&#8211;10 ppm with close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical SO2 sensitivity. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, phase stability and sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants and toxins.

         <title>Correlating Surface Crystal Orientation and Gas Kinetics in Perovskite Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;exchange kinetics in the perovskite oxide La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 are found to be strongly dependent on the exposed crystallographic surface. An all&#8208;perovksite, epitaxial half&#8208;cell is developed and characterized. The electrochemical performance of the different surface orientations is explained with insights from synchrotron&#8208;based ambient&#8208;pressure spectroscopy and density functional theory.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;gas interactions at electrode surfaces determine the efficiency of solid&#8208;oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers. Here, the correlation between surface&#8211;gas kinetics and the crystal orientation of perovskite electrodes is studied in the model system La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3. The gas&#8208;exchange kinetics are characterized by synthesizing epitaxial half&#8208;cell geometries where three single&#8208;variant surfaces are produced [i.e., La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3/La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.95Mg0.05O3&#8722;&#948;/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 (001), (110), and (111)]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrical conductivity relaxation measurements reveal a strong surface&#8208;orientation dependency of the gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, wherein (111)&#8208;oriented surfaces exhibit an activity &gt;3&#8208;times&#160;higher as compared to (001)&#8208;oriented surfaces. Oxygen partial pressure (pO2)&#8208;dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal that while the three surfaces have different gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, the reaction mechanisms and rate&#8208;limiting steps are the same (i.e., charge&#8208;transfer to the diatomic oxygen species). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the formation energy of vacancies and adsorption at the various surfaces is different and influenced by the surface polarity. Finally, synchrotron&#8208;based, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray spectroscopies reveal distinct electronic changes and surface chemistry among the different surface orientations. Taken together, thin&#8208;film epitaxy provides an efficient approach to control and understand the electrode reactivity ultimately demonstrating that the (111)&#8208;surface exhibits a high density of active surface sites which leads to higher activity.

         <title>Polymorph Engineering for Boosted Volumetric Na&#8208;Ion and Li&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the inherent high electronic conductivity of metallic tetragonal FeSe, a conducting additive&#8208;free (CA&#8208;free) electrode configuration is realized. The CA&#8208;free electrode demonstrates high volumetric and high initial Coulombic efficiency for sodium storage. The proposed design strategy is also expanded to a Li&#8208;storage system, which exhibits superior volumetric energy and power densities.








Abstract
To meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for advanced rechargeable batteries with light weight and compact size, much effort has been devoted to improving the volumetric capacity of electrodes. Herein, an effective strategy of polymorph engineering is proposed to boost the volumetric capacity of FeSe. Owing to the inherent metallic electronic conductivity of tetragonal&#8208;FeSe, a conductive additive&#8208;free electrode (hereafter denoted as CA&#8208;free) can be assembled with an enhanced sodium storage volumetric capacity of 1011 mAh cm&#8722;3, significantly higher than semiconducting hexagonal&#8208;FeSe. Impressively, the CA&#8208;free electrode can achieve an extremely high active material utilization of 96.7&#160;wt% and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96%, superior to most of the anodes for Na&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, the design methodology is branched out using tetragonal FeSe as the cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The CA&#8208;free tetragonal&#8208;FeSe electrode can achieve a high volumetric energy density of 1373&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and power density of 7200 W L&#8722;1, outperforming most metal chalcogenides. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by in situ XRD for both sodium and lithium systems. The proposed design strategy provides new insight and inspiration to aid in the ongoing quest for better electrode materials.

         <title>Templateless, Plating&#8208;Free Fabrication of Flexible Transparent Electrodes with Embedded Silver Mesh by Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Microscale 3D Printing and Hybrid Hot Embossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication method for high&#8208;performance flexible transparent electrodes with embedded silver mesh is proposed by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven microscale 3D printing technique and a hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The flexible transparent electrode with embedded silver mesh exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, remarkable mechanical stability, and environmental adaptability.








Abstract
Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) with an embedded metal mesh are considered a promising alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) due to their excellent photoelectric performance, surface roughness, and mechanical and environmental stability. However, great challenges remain for achieving simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly manufacturing of high&#8208;performance FTEs with embedded metal mesh. Herein, a maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication technique is proposed for FTEs with embedded silver mesh by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven (EFD) microscale 3D printing technique and a newly developed hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The final fabricated FTE exhibits superior optoelectronic properties with a transmittance of 85.79%, a sheet resistance of 0.75 &#937; sq&#8722;1, a smooth surface of silver mesh (Ra&#160;&#8776; 18.8&#160;nm) without any polishing treatment, and remarkable mechanical stability and environmental adaptability with a negligible increase in sheet resistance under diverse cyclic tests and harsh working conditions (1000 bending cycles, 80 adhesion tests, 120 scratch tests, 100&#160;min ultrasonic test, and 72 h chemical attack). The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly process for high&#8208;performance FTE.

         <title>Printable Off&#8211;On Thermoswitchable Fluorescent Materials for Programmable Thermally Controlled Full&#8208;Color Displays and Multiple Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) are achieved successfully. They benefit from thermoinduced &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; synergistic changes of the fluorophores and fluorescence modifier, as well as the corresponding F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are easy to prepare and have high fluorescence emission contrast, great reversibility, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. All of these features contribute their potential in multiple advanced applications.








Abstract
Thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) have received special attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric responses to temperature. Conventional TFMs generally display unicolor with switching from one color to another, showing unprintable and unsatisfied performances. These limitations greatly hinder their development and expansion toward advanced applications. Herein, the superior integration of full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on switching mode, printability, and high performance to TFMs is achieved successfully. The success is due to a thermally induced synchronous &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; stimulus&#8211;response mode regulated by a self&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;change material; that is, synergistic changes of the molecular existence states and subsequent colors/spectra of the fluorescent modifier and fluorophores, accompanied by corresponding high&#8208;efficiency on&#8211;off switching of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are simple to prepare and show good performance, such as high fluorescence emission contrast (&gt;100), great reversibility (&gt;200 cycles), and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. Particularly, these R/G/B TFMs can be prepared as tricolor fluorescent inks, and thus full&#8208;color emissions on flexible substrate can be easily obtained by printing. Finally, their great potential in switchable dynamic interior decoration, programmatic temperature&#8208;control information display, and senior information encryption are illustrated. This successful exploration offers a new perspective for designing and optimizing various other switchable materials with higher comprehensive performances.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 can work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the device shows almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the devices show almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h. The enhanced EQEs at low temperatures result from the increased photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the perovskite, which is caused by the increased radiative recombination rate. Spectroscopic and calculation results suggest that the phase transitions of the FAPbI3 play an important role for the enhancement of exciton binding energy, which increases the recombination rate.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <title>A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Wetting&#8208;Front Transient Heat Release on a Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber papers. As a potential disruption to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, the study shows promise for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices.








Abstract
Transient heat generation during guest adsorption and host&#8211;guest interactions is a natural phenomenon in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) chemistry. However, in situ tracking of such MOF released heat is an insufficiently researched field due to the fast heat dissipation to the surroundings. Herein, a facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber substrates. Spatiotemporal temperature distributions are obtained with infrared thermal imaging for a range of MOF&#8208;based substrates and imbibed liquids. Temperature rises at the wetting front of water and binary mixtures with organic solvents are found to be over 10&#160;K with an ultrafast and distinguishable thermal signal response (&lt;1 s) with a detectable concentration limit &#8804;1 wt%. As an advancement to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, this study shows great prospects for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices. Inspired by this prototypal study, SURMOF&#8208;based transient heat signal transduction is likely to be extended to an ever&#8208;expanding library of SURMOFs and other classes of surface&#8208;grafted porous materials, translating into a wide range of convenient, portable, and ubiquitous sensor devices.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion&#8208;transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, a power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS2 to MoS2 part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&#8211;2 and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&#8211;2. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic&#8208;to&#8208;ionic power generation within angstrom&#8208;scale confinement anticipates potential for light&#8208;controlled ionic circuits, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic energy conversion.

         <title>Embolization of Vascular Malformations via In Situ Photocrosslinking of Mechanically Reinforced Alginate Microfibers using an Optical&#8208;Fiber&#8208;Integrated Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder is proposed that employs the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking through visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking by Ca2+ in the blood. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers by in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is developed.








Abstract
Embolization, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment, is a safe and effective procedure for treating vascular malformations (e.g., aneurysms). Hydrogel microfibers obtained via spatiotemporally controllable in situ photocrosslinking exhibit great potential for embolizing aneurysms. However, this process is challenging because of the absence of biocompatible and morphologically stable hydrogels and the difficulty in continuously spinning the microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments such as those involving a tortuous geometry and high absorbance. A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder (DAT) that exploits the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking by visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking using Ca2+, which is present in the blood, is developed in this study. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device (OFI&#8208;MD) that can continuously spin hydrogel microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is proposed. As an embolic material, DAT exhibits promising characteristics such as radiopacity, nondissociation, nonswelling, and constant mechanical strength in blood, in addition to excellent cyto&#8208; and hemo&#8208;compatibilities. Using OFI&#8208;MD to spin DAT microfibers continuously can help fill aneurysms safely, uniformly, and completely within the endovascular simulator without generating microscopic fragments, which demonstrates its potential as an effective embolization strategy.

Using OFI&#8208;MD to spin DAT microfibers continuously can help fill aneurysms safely, uniformly, and completely within the endovascular simulator without generating microscopic fragments, which demonstrates its potential as an effective embolization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, and even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films is fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Biologically Plausible Artificial Synaptic Array: Replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; Memory Curve with Selective Attention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is developed, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively.








Abstract
The nature of repetitive learning and oblivion of memory enables humans to effectively manage vast amounts of memory by prioritizing information for long&#8208;term storage. Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is presented, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively. To secure the desired performance of the access transistor in regulating the input signal to the synaptic transistor, the content of gallium in the access transistor is optimized. In addition, the operation voltage of the synaptic transistor is carefully selected to achieve memory&#8208;state efficiency. Repetitive learning characterizing Ebbinghaus&#8217; oblivion curves is realized using an artificial synaptic array with optimized conditions for both transistor components. This successfully demonstrates a biologically plausible memorization process. Furthermore, selective attention for information prioritization in the human brain is mimicked by selectively applying repetitive learning to a synaptic transistor with a high memory state. The demonstrated biologically plausible artificial synaptic array provides great scope for advancement in bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Infrared Metasurface Augmented by Deep Learning for Monitoring Dynamics between All Major Classes of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces have outstanding light manipulation capabilities at the nanoscale, which enable functions beyond what otherwise is seen in nature. In this work, highly sensitive, broadband mid&#8208;IR metasurfaces for spectroscopy are augmented with artificial intelligence to allow the label&#8208;free monitoring of biomolecules from all major classes. This pioneering bioanalytical technology offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling complex biomolecular processes.








Abstract
Insights into the fascinating molecular world of biological processes are crucial for understanding diseases, developing diagnostics, and effective therapeutics. These processes are complex as they involve interactions between four major classes of biomolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which makes it important to be able to discriminate between all these different biomolecular species. In this work, a deep learning&#8208;augmented, chemically&#8208;specific nanoplasmonic technique that enables such a feat in a label&#8208;free manner to not disrupt native processes is presented. The method uses a highly sensitive multiresonant plasmonic metasurface in a microfluidic device, which enhances infrared absorption across a broadband mid&#8208;IR spectrum and in water, despite its strongly overlapping absorption bands. The real&#8208;time format of the optofluidic method enables the collection of a vast amount of spectrotemporal data, which allows the construction of a deep neural network to discriminate accurately between all major classes of biomolecules. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated by monitoring of a multistep bioassay containing sucrose&#8208; and nucleotides&#8208;loaded liposomes interacting with a small, lipid membrane&#8208;perforating peptide. It is envisioned that the presented technology will impact the fields of biology, bioanalytics, and pharmacology from fundamental research and disease diagnostics to drug development.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2006759, Hyung Joon Cha, Joonwon Kim,  and co&#8208;workers develop an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking in extreme endovascular environments. The hydrogel microfibers are based on a double&#8208;crosslinked alginate that employs the dityrosine bond. This microfluidic device with hydrogel microfibers is an attractive strategy to fill aneurysms effectively.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide: Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide (Adv. Mater. 14/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006957, Nomi L. A. N. Sorgenfrei and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a weak optical excitation creates electrons in the conduction band of p&#8208;doped semiconducting molybdenum disulfide, which travel toward the surface layer. They accumulate in the top layer and concomitantly drive it from the semiconducting toward the metallic phase. The selectivity of synchrotron time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy traces this effect. This surface modification influences the properties and functionality of MoS2. Frontispiece Art: Martin K&#252;nsting.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Beyond the Visible: Bioinspired Infrared Adaptive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art account on emerging bioinspired infrared adaptive materials and their potential applications is provided. Perspectives for future scope, challenges, and opportunities on such a multidisciplinary topic are outlined.








Abstract
Infrared (IR) adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. Taking inspiration from natural creatures, researchers have devoted extensive efforts for developing advanced IR adaptive materials and exploring their applications in areas of smart camouflage, thermal energy management, biomedical science, and many other IR&#8208;related technological fields. Herein, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is provided on the recent advancements of bioinspired IR adaptive materials and their promising applications.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers, but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (H31) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending H31 with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;def:6,5,10&#8208;d&#8242;e&#8242;f&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL. Small&#8208;molecule donor&#8211;acceptor blends thus provide interesting perspectives for achieving efficient, reproducible, and stable device architectures without electrode interlayers.

         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.

         <title>Functional Skeletal Muscle Regeneration with Thermally Drawn Porous Fibers and Reprogrammed Muscle Progenitors for Volumetric Muscle Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioengineered skeletal muscle construct is generated by culturing induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells in a thermally drawn polycaprolactone porous fiber scaffold modified with decellularized muscle extracellular matrix. The hybrid composite fiber shows favorable mechanical and biochemical signals for muscle reprogramming and maturation. The bioengineered muscle construct repairs volumetric muscle loss injury via de novo muscle regeneration and functional restoration.








Abstract
Skeletal muscle has an inherent capacity for spontaneous regeneration. However, recovery after severe injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML) is limited. There is therefore a need to develop interventions to induce functional skeletal muscle restoration. One suggested approach includes tissue&#8208;engineered muscle constructs. Tissue&#8208;engineering treatments have so far been impeded by the lack of reliable cell sources and the challenges in engineering of suitable tissue scaffolds. To address these challenges, muscle extracellular matrix (MEM) and induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) are integrated within thermally drawn fiber based microchannel scaffolds. The microchannel fibers decorated with MEM enhance differentiation and maturation of iMPCs. Furthermore, engraftment of these bioengineered hybrid muscle constructs induce de novo muscle regeneration accompanied with microvessel and neuromuscular junction formation in a VML mouse model, ultimately leading to functional recovery of muscle activity.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitive Compression&#8208;Stress Sensor Using Integrated Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak compression stresses on the order of 100 to 103 Pa, found in a broad range of physical phenomena from the daily life to the laboratory, are not detected by conventional mechanoresponsive materials. Visualization and colorimetric quantification of weak compression stresses are achieved by integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, namely layered polydiacetylene and dry liquid, through response cascades.








Abstract
Measurement of mechanical stresses, such as compression, shear, and tensile stresses, contributes toward achieving a safer and healthier life. In particular, the detection of weak compression stresses is required for healthcare monitoring and biomedical applications. Compression stresses in the order of 106&#8211;1010&#160;Pa have been visualized and/or quantified using mechano&#8208;responsive materials in previous works. However, in general, it is not easy to detect compression stresses weaker than 103&#160;Pa using conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials because the dynamic motion of the rigid mechano&#8208;responsive molecules is not induced by such a weak stress. In the present work, weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103&#160;Pa are visualized and measured via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such as layered polydiacetylene (PDA) and dry liquid (DL), through response cascades. DLs consisting of liquid droplets covered by solid particles release the interior liquid and collapse with application of a weak compression stress. The color of the layered PDA is changed by the spilled liquid as a chemical stress. A variety of weak compression stresses, such as expiratory pressure, are visualized and colorimetrically measured using the paper&#8208;based device of the integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Diverse mechano&#8208;sensing devices can be designed via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Lithium Metal Electrode with Increased Air Stability and Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Realized by Silane Coupling Agent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for amorphous silicon, 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for metal oxides, and 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilizing Pt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction are comprehensively reviewed. First, the basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, the design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are proposed.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) with high efficiency and nonpollution characteristics have attracted massive attention from both academic and industrial communities due to their irreplaceable roles in building the future sustainable energy system. However, the stability issue of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a central constraint to the widespread deployment of the devices relative to the catalytic activity. This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into how to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for ORR. First, the basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation, including the fundamental understandings of carbon corrosion, catalyst dissolution, and particle sintering, is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, the design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are summarized. Finally, further insights into the remaining challenges and future research directions are also provided.

         <title>Elucidation of Diffusivity of Hydrogen Isotopes in Flexible MOFs by Quasi&#8208;Elastic Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental observation of hydrogen isotope diffusion in flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) is demonstrated through quasielastic neutron scattering. Unlike rigid structures, the diffusion difference between the isotopes in the flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) system.








Abstract
Kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted H2:D2 separation in flexible porous materials is more effective than the currently used energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation and girdle&#8208;sulfide processes for isotope separation. It is believed that material flexibility results in a pore&#8208;breathing phenomenon under the influence of external stimuli, which helps in adjusting the pore size and gives rise to the optimum quantum&#8208;sieving phenomenon at each stage of gas separation. However, only a few studies have investigated kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted isotope separation using flexible porous materials. In addition, no reports are available on the microscopic observation of isotopic molecular transportation during the separation process under dynamic transition. Here, the experimental observation of a significantly faster diffusion of deuterium than hydrogen in a flexible pore structure, even at high temperatures, through quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering, is reported. Unlike rigid structures, the extracted diffusion dynamics of hydrogen isotopes within flexible frameworks show that the diffusion difference between the isotopes increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework system.

         <title>Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathode Design: Tailoring Metal&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Robust Polysulfide Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8211;sulfur battery is the frontrunner technology for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage stemming from its high specific energy capacity and superior energy density. This review presents myriads of transition metals, metal dichalcogenides, metal phosphides, metal oxides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, and others (e.g., metal phosphosulfides, metal hydroxides, metal&#8208;organic frameworks and hybrids), which can serve as robust cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high specific energy capacity and density of 1675 mAh g&#8722;1 and 2670&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively, rendering them among the most promising successors for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there are myriads of obstacles in the practical application and commercialization of Li&#8208;S batteries, including the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2), volume expansion of sulfur electrode, and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Hence, immense attention has been devoted to rectifying these issues, of which the application of metal&#8208;based compounds (i.e., transition metal, metal phosphides, sulfides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphosulfides, MXenes, hydroxides, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks) as sulfur hosts is profiled as a fascinating strategy to hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect stemming from the polar&#8211;polar interactions between the metal compounds and polysulfides. This review encompasses the fundamental electrochemical principles of Li&#8208;S batteries and insights into the interactions between the metal&#8208;based compounds and the polysulfides, with emphasis on the intimate structure&#8211;activity relationship corroborated with theoretical calculations. Additionally, the integration of conductive carbon&#8208;based materials to ameliorate the existing adsorptive abilities of the metal&#8208;based compound is systematically discussed. Lastly, the challenges and prospects toward the smart design of catalysts for the future development of practical Li&#8208;S batteries are presented.

         <title>Plasmonic Core&#8211;Shell Nanomaterials and their Applications in Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly localized and strong electromagnetic fields generated by plasmonic nanomaterials, when excited by incident lasers with suitable wavelengths, can greatly boost the excitation and/or radiation processes of various spectroscopies, including Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear spectroscopies, giving enhanced signals and improved spectral sensitivity.








Abstract
Plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the scientific community recently due to their highly tunable optical properties. Plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies are one of the main applications of plasmonic nanomaterials. When excited by an incident laser of suitable wavelength, strong and highly localized electromagnetic (EM) fields are generated around plasmonic nanomaterials, which can significantly boost excitation and/or radiation processes that amplify Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear signals and improve spectroscopic sensitivity. Herein, recent developments in plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies utilizing core&#8211;shell nanostructures are reviewed, including shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, and plasmon&#8208;enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;The highly localized and strong electromagnetic fields generated by plasmonic nanomaterials, when excited by incident lasers with suitable wavelengths, can greatly boost the excitation and/or radiation processes of various spectroscopies, including Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear spectroscopies, giving enhanced signals and improved spectral sensitivity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the scientific community recently due to their highly tunable optical properties. Plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies are one of the main applications of plasmonic nanomaterials. When excited by an incident laser of suitable wavelength, strong and highly localized electromagnetic (EM) fields are generated around plasmonic nanomaterials, which can significantly boost excitation and/or radiation processes that amplify Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear signals and improve spectroscopic sensitivity. Herein, recent developments in plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies utilizing core&#8211;shell nanostructures are reviewed, including shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, and plasmon&#8208;enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insights on Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries from Lab Research to Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insight from lab research to commercialization for flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries is provided by comprehensively reviewing the development of polymer electrolytes, relevant challenges and strategies, and device configurations. Aiming to quantify the feasibility for commercialization, a ranking index is proposed combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward commercialization.








Abstract
Owing to the development of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), flexible ZIBs are deemed as potential candidates to power wearable electronics. ZIBs with solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes can not only maintain additional load&#8208;bearing properties, but exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties by preventing dendrite formation and inhibiting cathode dissolution. Substantial efforts have been applied to polymer electrolytes by developing solid polymer electrolytes, hydrogel polymer electrolytes, and hybrid polymer electrolytes; however, the research of polymer electrolytes for ZIBs is still immature. Herein, the recent progress in polymer electrolytes is summarized by category for flexible ZIBs, especially hydrogel electrolytes, including their synthesis and characterization. Aiming to provide an insight from lab research to commercialization, the relevant challenges, device configurations, and life cycle analysis are consolidated. As flexible batteries, the majority of polymer electrolytes exploited so far only emphasizes the electrochemical performance but the mechanical behavior and interactions with the electrode materials have hardly been considered. Hence, strategies of combining softness and strength and the integration with electrodes are discussed for flexible ZIBs. A ranking index, combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties, is introduced. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward the commercialization of flexible ZIBs.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Innate Immunity Activation by Mitochondrial DNA Oxidative Damage for Tumor&#8208;Specific Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is demonstrated, in which a nanocatalytic medicine, named MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ nanoparticles, is constructed to target mitochondria for causing oxidative damage to mtDNA, initiating the M1 polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophage to suppress the growth of tumor cells.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a key role in protecting the human body from tumors, which, unfortunately, is largely counteracted by their immune&#8208;suppression function. Such an immune suppression has been reported to be induced by the immunosuppressive microenvironment, including the exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Here, a novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on the nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is proposed. In detail, a nanocatalytic medicine, Fe2+&#8211;Ru2+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle named as MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ (MRF), is constructed to induce oxidative damage in the mtDNA of tumor cells. Such an oxidative mtDNA is able to escape from the tumor cells and acts as an immunogenic damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;pattern to M1&#8208;polarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in the reactivated immunoresponse of macrophages against cancer cells, and the subsequent inflammatory response of innate immunity. Most importantly, the treatment strategy based on regulating the innate immune response of TAMs not only stops the primary tumor progression, but also almost completely inhibits the growth of distant tumors in the periods of treatments.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D Copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolate Coordination Polymer Nanosheets for Efficient and Selective Gene Silencing and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.








Abstract
Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method. These CP nanosheets can act as both an effective DNAzyme nanocarrier for gene therapy and an intrinsic photosensitizer for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is ascribed to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Because of the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsiveness of the CP nanosheets, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded CP nanosheets exhibit excellent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing of the early growth response factor&#8208;1 (EGR&#8208;1), with messenger RNA inhibited by 84% in MCF&#8208;7 (human breast cancer cells) and only 6% in MCF&#8208;10A (normal human mammary epithelial cells). After tail intravenous injection into MCF&#8208;7&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the CP nanosheets loaded with chlorin&#8208;e6&#8208;modified DNAzyme under photoirradiation show a high antitumor efficacy (88.0% tumor regression), demonstrating a promising therapeutic platform with efficient and selective gene silencing and PDT of cancer.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 22% via Small&#8208;Molecule Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate is introduced in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process, and external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes as high as 22.49% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high&#8208;quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T50 operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide bandgap oxide semiconductors uniquely combine electrical conductivity and optical transparency and are widely used in optoelectronic devices. This review focuses on the materials physics of wide bandgap oxide semiconductors and recent progress in the design of new materials and novel thin film transistor (TFT) devices, and current challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
Wide bandgap oxide semiconductors constitute a unique class of materials that combine properties of electrical conductivity and optical transparency. They are being widely used as key materials in optoelectronic device applications, including flat&#8208;panel displays, solar cells, OLED, and emerging flexible and transparent electronics. In this article, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review on both the fundamental understanding of materials physics of oxide semiconductors, and recent research progress on design of new materials and high&#8208;performing thin film transistor (TFT) devices in the context of fundamental understanding is presented. In particular, an in depth overview is first provided on current understanding of the electronic structures, defect and doping chemistry, optical and transport properties of oxide semiconductors, which provide essential guiding principles for new material design and device optimization. With these principles, recent advances in design of p&#8208;type oxide semiconductors, new approaches for achieving cost&#8208;effective transparent (flexible) electrodes, and the creation of high mobility 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide surfaces and interfaces with a wealth of fascinating physical properties of great potential for novel device design are then reviewed. Finally, recent progress and perspective of oxide TFT based on new oxide semiconductors, 2DEG, and low&#8208;temperature solution processed oxide semiconductor for flexible electronics will be reviewed.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Coating&#8208;Instructed Plasmonic Modulation of Gold Nanorods for Activatable Duplex&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided NIR&#8208;II Photothermal&#8208;Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. Additionally, the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator, which endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance, remarkable cycling stability, and high actual energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under practical pouch cell conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, where soluble lithium polysulfides are crucial in the Li&#8211;S electrochemistry as intrinsic redox mediators.

Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging.

Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated, which is termed an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable gas sensors provide a next&#8208;generation wearable platform for real&#8208;time protection of human health by monitoring environmental and physiological chemicals. However, the creation of skin&#8208;like wearable gas sensors, possessing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and scalability (4S) simultaneously, has been a big challenge. Here, an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker (IGS) is demonstrated, implemented with free&#8208;standing polymer electrolyte (ionic thermoplastic polyurethane, i&#8208;TPU) as a sensing channel and inkjet&#8208;printed stretchable carbon nanotube electrodes, which enables the IGS to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, stability (against mechanical stress, humidity, and temperature), and scalable fabrication, simultaneously. The IGS demonstrates reliable sensing capability against nitrogen dioxide molecules under not only harsh mechanical stress (cyclic bending with the radius of curvature of 1 mm and cyclic straining at 50%), but also environmental conditions (thermal aging from &#8722;45 to 125 &#176;C for 1000 cycles and humidity aging for 24 h at 85% relative humidity). Further, through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, a &#960;&#8208;hole receptor mechanism is proposed, which can effectively elucidate the origin of the high sensitivity (up to parts per billion level) and selectivity of the ionotronic sensing system. Consequently, this work provides a guideline for the design of ionotronic materials for the achievement of high&#8208;performance and skin&#8208;attachable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

The temperature coefficient is optimized by tuning the hydration entropy during cation intercalation with Prussian blue analogues. A high thermal energy conversion efficiency of 50% Carnot efficiency is obtained in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle in the very low temperature range of 10&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C. This demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.








Abstract
Harvesting of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is promising, but its application is hampered by a lack of efficient and low&#8208;cost systems. The thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a potential alternative system with high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Here, the temperature coefficient (&#945;), which is a key factor in a TREC, is studied by tuning the hydration entropy of the electrochemical reaction. The change of &#945; in copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) with intercalation of different monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and a larger &#945; value of &#8722;1.004&#160;mV K&#8722;1 being found in the Rb+ system are observed. With a view to practical application, a full cell is constructed for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The resultant &#951;e is 4.34% when TREC operates between 10 and 50&#160;&#176;C, which further reaches 6.21% when 50% heat recuperation is considered. This efficiency equals to 50% of the Carnot efficiency, which is thought to be the highest &#951;e reported for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing the TREC, and the demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.

         <title>Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications. Here, ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are introduced, combining high&#8208;potential (anodic stability: &gt;5&#160;V vs Li/Li+) and low&#8208;potential (cathodic stability: &lt;0&#160;V vs Li/Li+) imidazolium ionic liquids in a hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelet matrix. These layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes lead to extended electrochemical windows, while preserving high ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature). Using the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes, full&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode are demonstrated, exhibiting voltages that are unachievable with either the high&#8208;potential or low&#8208;potential ionic liquid alone. Compared to ionogel electrolytes based on mixed ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes enable higher stability operation of full&#8208;cell lithium&#8208;ion batteries, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting MOF Films on Dielectric Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method is developed to grow high&#8208;quality wafer&#8208;sacle Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film on dielectric substrates. The film exhibits p&#8208;type semiconducting property and excellent photoelectric response. Meanwhile, this growth strategy can also be used to prepare other wafer&#8208;sacle conductive MOF films.








Abstract
The preparation of large&#8208;area 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films remains highly desirable but challenging. Here, inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to grow conductive 2D Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) MOF films on dielectric substrates is developed. Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu2+ and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu2(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&#8722;1, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M3(HHTP)2 (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in the silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

&lt;p&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of an AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Growing Living Composites with Ordered Microstructures and Exceptional Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm is presented to guide living bacteria to grow bionic mineralized composites. The strategy demonstrates a class of living composites with ordered microstructures and exceptional mechanical properties. This research progress highlights an exciting opportunity for future bionic composite materials by tailoring the interaction or communication between living organisms and 3D&#8208;printed synthetic materials.








Abstract
Living creatures are continuous sources of inspiration for designing synthetic materials. However, living creatures are typically different from synthetic materials because the former consist of living cells to support their growth and regeneration. Although natural systems can grow materials with sophisticated microstructures, how to harness living cells to grow materials with predesigned microstructures in engineering systems remains largely elusive. Here, an attempt to exploit living bacteria and 3D&#8208;printed materials to grow bionic mineralized composites with ordered microstructures is reported. The bionic composites exhibit outstanding specific strength and fracture toughness, which are comparable to natural composites, and exceptional energy absorption capability superior to both natural and artificial counterparts. This report opens the door for 3D&#8208;architectured hybrid synthetic&#8211;living materials with living ordered microstructures and exceptional properties.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries (Adv. Mater. 13/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed by Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007864, using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared with ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Redox co&#8208;mediation provides an effective approach to promote the reaction kinetics of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. In article number 2007298, Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers propose an organodiselenide as a redox co&#8208;mediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics. The organodiselenide co&#8208;mediator endows lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with superb electrochemical performance with high actual energy density of 301 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. Relevant theories, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic 2D ferroelectrics, are outlined. Further, the existing challenges and prospects of the exploration in 2D ferroelectrics are also discussed, which should provide unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, and valleytronics.








Abstract
Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D&#160;ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D&#160;ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory&#8208;validated 2D ferroelectric&#8208;based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer applications with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing intracellular delivery approaches are differentiated by their impact resolution to macro&#8208; and micro/nanoengineering strategies. Each method is characterized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargo inside the cell of interest. The applications and future perspectives of micro/nanoscale delivery strategies are discussed.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery is considered an indispensable process for various studies, ranging from medical applications (cell&#8208;based therapy) to fundamental (genome&#8208;editing) and industrial (biomanufacture) approaches. Conventional macroscale delivery systems critically suffer from such issues as low cell viability, cytotoxicity, and inconsistent material delivery, which have opened up an interest in the development of more efficient intracellular delivery systems. In line with the advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology, intracellular delivery based on micro&#8208; and nanoengineered platforms has progressed rapidly and held great promises owing to their unique features. These approaches have been advanced to introduce a smorgasbord of diverse cargoes into various cell types with the maximum efficiency and the highest precision. This review differentiates macro&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and nanoengineered approaches for intracellular delivery. The macroengineered delivery platforms are first summarized and then each method is categorized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargoes inside the cells. Second, particular emphasis is placed on the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered advances in the delivery of biomolecules inside the cells. Furthermore, the applications and challenges of the established and emerging delivery approaches are summarized. The topic is concluded by evaluating the future perspective of intracellular delivery toward the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered approaches.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2&#8208;Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere supported Pt single atom (Pt1/NMHCS) composite for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by a novel strategy. Owing to the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction in the unique N1&#8722;Pt&#8722;C2 coordination structure that significantly alters the electronic structure of the Pt 5d states, both the reduction of adsorbed H+ and the generation of H2 are promoted, thus leading to bare&#8208;Pt&#8208;like activity and extraordinary durability for HER.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20&#160;wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 50&#160;mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1&#8722;Pt1&#8722;C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H&#8722;H coupling, and thus Pt&#8208;like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atom&#8208;based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.

         <title>Conferring Ti&#8208;Based MOFs with Defects for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) is successfully constructed by simple hydrogenation and serves as a new generation of robust sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, it also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to amplify reactive oxygen species production under ultrasound irradiation. Besides, the degradability of D&#8208;MOF(Ti) is a bright spot for promoting its clinical transformation.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient, multifunctional, and biocompatible sonosensitizer is still a priority for current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) with greatly improved sonosensitizing effect is simply constructed and used for enhanced SDT. Compared with the commonly used sonosensitizer TiO2, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) results in a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield under ultrasound (US) irradiation due to its narrow bandgap, which principally improves the US&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation. Meanwhile, due to the existence of Ti3+ ions, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to enable chemodynamic therapy. Particularly, US as the excitation source of SDT can simultaneously enhance the Fenton&#8208;like reaction to achieve remarkably synergistic outcomes for oncotherapy. More importantly, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) can be degraded and metabolized out of the body after completion of its therapeutic functions without off&#8208;target toxicity. Overall, this work identifies a novel Ti&#8208;familial sonosensitizer harboring great potential for synergistic sonodynamic and chemodynamic cancer therapy.

         <title>Epigenetic Remodeling Hydrogel Patches for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epi&#8208;gel provides chemosensitivity recovery and immune activation via simultaneous remodeling of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;IC) stemness and innate immune response. A single dose of epi&#8208;gel pools the advantages of epigenetic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in the treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), achieving superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional drug delivery.








Abstract
The induced expansion of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;ICs) upon repeated exposure of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs forms a major cause for chemoresistance and cancer metastasis. Here, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive hydrogel patch is designed to modulate the plasticity of T&#8208;ICs in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to hormone&#8208; and HER2&#8208;targeting. The on&#8208;site formation of the hydrogel network patches tumors in a chemoresistant TNBC murine model and senses intratumoral reactive oxygen species for linker cleavage and payload release. Patch&#8208;mediated inhibition of the histone demethylase lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically regulates the switch of T&#8208;ICs from self&#8208;renewal to differentiation, rehabilitating their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the hydrogel patch enhances tumor immunogenicity and increases T&#8208;cell infiltration via epigenetic activation of innate immunity. A single&#8208;dose of the hydrogel patch harboring LSD1 inhibitor and chemotherapy agent efficiently suppresses tumor growth, postsurgical relapse, and metastasis. The superior efficacy against multidrug resistance further reveals the broad applicability of epigenetic remodeling hydrogel patches.

         <title>Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Realizing External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are developed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor configuration. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off is due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and short delayed exciton lifetime.








Abstract
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are reported. These materials are designed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) configuration, containing rigid boron acceptors and dihydrophenazine donor moieties. These materials exhibit a small &#916;EST of 0.05&#8211;0.06&#160;eV, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as near unity, and short delayed exciton lifetime (&#964;d) of less than 2.63 &#181;s in 5 wt% doped film. Further, these materials show a high reverse intersystem crossing rate (krisc) on the order of 106 s&#8722;1. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum EQE of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 576 nm and 595&#160;nm, respectively. The low roll&#8208;off character of these materials is analyzed by using a roll&#8208;off model and the exciton annihilation quenching rates are found to be suppressed by the fast krisc and short delayed exciton lifetime. These devices show operating device lifetimes (LT50) of 159 and 193 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 for PzTDBA and PzDBA, respectively. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off of these materials are attributed to the good electronic properties originatng from the A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecular configuration.

         <title>Nanoporous Intermetallic Pd3Bi for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi is prepared through electrochemical etching of PdBi2, and it can achieve extraordinary catalytic performance with high selectivity and excellent stability for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions. The intermetallic interaction between the Pd and neighboring Bi sites in nanoporous Pd3Bi can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier for efficient NRR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction at ambient temperature is a green technology for artificial nitrogen fixation but greatly challenging with low yield and poor selectivity. Here, a nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi prepared by converting chemically etched nanoporous PdBi2 exhibits efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoporous intermetallic Pd3Bi can achieve high activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 59.05&#160;&#177; 2.27&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 21.52&#160;&#177; 0.71% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.05 m H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming most of the reported catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong coupling between the Pd&#8211;Bi sites bridges the electron&#8208;transfer channel of intermetallic Pd3Bi, in which the Bi sites can absorb N2 molecules and lower the energy barrier of *N2 for N2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the intermetallic Pd3Bi with bicontinuous nanoporous structure can accelerate the electron transport during the NRR process, thus improving the NRR performance.

         <title>Exploiting Mechanical Instabilities in Soft Robotics: Control, Sensing, and Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical instabilities provide a novel route to achieve power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. An overview of the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. These strategies have the potential to address the current challenges in the areas of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation.








Abstract
The rapidly expanding field of soft robotics has provided multiple examples of how entirely soft machines and actuators can outperform conventional rigid robots in terms of adaptability, maneuverability, and safety. Unfortunately, the soft and flexible materials used in their construction impose intrinsic limitations on soft robots, such as low actuation speeds and low output forces. Nature offers multiple examples where highly flexible organisms exploit mechanical instabilities to store and rapidly release energy. Guided by these examples, researchers have recently developed a variety of strategies to overcome speed and power limitations in soft robotics using mechanical instabilities. These mechanical instabilities provide, through rapid transitions from structurally stable states, a new route to achieve high output power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. Here, an overview of the literature related to the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. Additionally, strategies using structural phase transitions to address current challenges in the area of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation are discussed. Approaches using instabilities to create entirely soft logic modules to imbue soft robots with material intelligence and distributed computational capabilities are also reviewed.

         <title>Development of a Cancer Vaccine Using In Vivo Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Active Lymph Node Accumulation for Improved Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active lymph node (LN) accumulation system is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with azide groups, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated cargoes to LNs. When loading with antigens and adjuvants, the formulation elicits an enhanced immune response, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged survival of mice.








Abstract
Due to their ability to elicit a potent immune reaction with low systemic toxicity, cancer vaccines represent a promising strategy for treating tumors. Considerable effort has been directed toward improving the in vivo efficacy of cancer vaccines, with direct lymph node (LN) targeting being the most promising approach. Here, a click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based active LN accumulation system (ALAS) is developed by surface modification of lymphatic endothelial cells with an azide group, which provide targets for dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified liposomes, to improve the delivery of encapsulated antigen and adjuvant to LNs. When loading with OVA257&#8211;264 peptide and poly(I:C), the formulation elicits an enhanced CD8+ T cell response in vivo, resulting in a much more efficient therapeutic effect and prolonged median survival of mice. Compared to treatment with DBCO&#8208;conjugated liposomes (DL)&#8208;Ag/Ad without the azide targeting, the percent survival of ALAS&#8208;vaccine&#8208;treated mice improves by 100% over 60 days. Altogether, the findings indicate that the novel ALAS approach is a powerful strategy to deliver vaccine components to LNs for enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH3 yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light&#8208;harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode is implemented. Such a decoupling design not only abolishes the parasitic light blocking but also concurrently improves the optical and electrical properties of the n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode without compromising the efficiency. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal that the porous architecture and N&#8208;vacancies promote N2 adsorption of the Au/porous carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. Impressively, an n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode integrating the Au/PCN catalyst exhibits an outstanding PEC NRR performance with maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.8% and NH3 production yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is the highest FE at low applied potential ever reported for the PEC NRR.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR and MRI Spectroscopy for Li/Na Batteries: Materials, Interface, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex and coupled (electro)chemical processes complicate the investigation of the working and decay mechanisms of batteries. ssNMR and MRI techniques exhibit unique capability in studying both the local environment and ionic dynamic issues in electrochemical energy materials and devices, including three key aspects, that are, electrode/electrolyte materials, electrode/electrolyte interfaces and in situ ssNMR.








Abstract
Enhancing the electrochemical performance of batteries, including the lifespan, energy, and power densities, is an everlasting quest for the rechargeable battery community. However, the dynamic and coupled (electro)chemical processes that occur in the electrode materials as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces complicate the investigation of their working and decay mechanisms. Herein, the recent developments and applications of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in Li/Na batteries are reviewed. Several typical cases including the applications of NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of the pristine structure and the dynamic structural evolution of materials are first emphasized. The NMR applications in analyzing the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) on the electrode are further concluded, involving the identification of SEI components and investigation of ionic motion through the interfaces. Beyond, the new development of in situ NMR and MRI techniques are highlighted, including their advantages, challenges, applications and the design principle of in situ cell. In the end, a prospect about how to use ssNMR in battery research from the perspectives of materials, interface, and in situ NMR, aiming at obtaining deeper insight of batteries with the assistance of ssNMR is represented.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Smart Hydrogel Releasing Immune Adjuvant Synchronized with Repeated Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alginate is conjugated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based smart hydrogel is formed in situ. Low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, can trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with an ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release to boost antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutics and forms of ionizing radiation can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). If there simultaneously exist immune adjuvants within the tumor, such antitumor immunity would be further amplified. However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.

         <title>Self&#8208;Structural Healing of Encapsulated Perovskite Microcrystals for Improved Optical and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;sufficient micron&#8208;level vacuum growth chamber is proposed for MAPbBr3 microcrystals to effectively prevent water and oxygen, and to greatly improve the thermal and optical stability by the reduction of deep level trap states.








Abstract
Perovskite materials and their optoelectronic devices have attracted intensive attentions in recent years. However, it is difficult to further improve the performance of perovskite devices due to the poor stability and the intrinsic deep level trap states (DLTS), which are caused by surface dangling bonds and grain boundaries. Herein, the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microcrystal is encapsulated by a dense Al2O3 layer to form a microenvironment. Through optical measurement, it is found that the structure of perovskite can be healed by itself even under high temperature and long&#8208;time laser illumination. The DLTS density decreases nearly an order of magnitude, which results in 4&#8211;14 times enhancement of light emission. The observation is ascribed to the micron&#8208;level environment, which serves as a self&#8208;sufficient high&#8208;vacuum growth chamber, where the components of the perovskite are completely retained when sublimated and the decomposed atoms can re&#8208;arrange after thermal treatment. The modified structure showing high thermal stability is able to maintain excellent optical and lasing stability up to 2 years. This discovery provides a new idea and perspective for improving the stability of perovskite and can be of practical interest for perovskite device application.

         <title>Excited State Energy Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) plays important role in using these materials for photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing, and emitting. Study of energy transfer mechanism helps to design efficient and directional energy transfer paths in MOFs to meet the needs of artificial photosynthesis, high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, and novel exciton&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great interest due to potential application of these materials in photocatalysis and fluorescence sensing. In photocatalysis, a light&#8208;harvesting antenna of MOFs can collect energy from a much larger area than a single reaction center and efficiently transport the energy to the active site to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, mimicking nature photosynthesis. In fluorescence sensing, excited state traveling on the framework can search for analyte quencher molecules to give amplified fluorescence quenching, so that one quencher turns off multiple excited states to enhance signal. Key to these designer performances is highly efficient energy transfer on these framework materials that are determined by types of excited states, dimension of the materials, and structure of the frameworks. Advancement of MOF synthetic chemistry provides new tools to control the rate and directionality of energy transfer in these materials, opening opportunities in manipulating excited states at an unprecedented level.

         <title>Reconstructable Gradient Structures and Reprogrammable 3D Deformations of Hydrogels with Coumarin Units as the Photolabile Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable shape&#8208;morphing of hydrogels is realized on the basis of reconstructable gradient networks containing coumarin units as photolabile crosslinks. Reversible photodimerization and photocleavage of coumarins at specific regions of one hydrogel are directed by photolithography. The reprogrammed structural gradients result in distinct internal stresses and 3D deformations of the hydrogel into different configurations.








Abstract
Morphing hydrogels have versatile applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices. Controlling component distribution and internal stress within a hydrogel is crucial for shape&#8208;changing. However, existing gradient structures of hydrogels are usually non&#8208;reconstructable, once encoded by chemical reactions and covalent bonds. Fabricating hydrogels with distinct gradient structures is inevitable for every new configuration, resulting in poor reusability, adaptability, and sustainability that are disadvantageous for diverse applications. Herein, a hydrogel containing reversible photo&#8208;crosslinks that enable reprogramming of the gradient structures and 3D deformations into various configurations is reported. The hydrogel is prepared by micellar polymerization of hydrophobic coumarin monomer and hydrophilic acrylic acid. The presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride micelles increases the local concentration of coumarin units and also improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by forming robust polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes that serve as the physical crosslinks. High&#8208;efficiency photodimerization and photocleavage reactions of coumarins are realized under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively, affording reversible tuning of the network structure of the hydrogel. Through photolithography, different gradient structures are sequentially patterned in one hydrogel that direct the deformations into distinct configurations. Such a strategy should be applicable for other photolabile hydrogels toward reprogrammable control of network structures and versatile functions.

         <title>Interactive Materials for Bidirectional Redox&#8208;Based Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active catechol&#8208;based film can autonomously synthesize diffusible H2O2 signals that enable interactive communication with biology. The reducing redox activities of a bacterial culture provide the electrons that poise this film for subsequent electron&#8208;donation to O2 to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that induces redox&#8208;responsive gene expression.








Abstract
Emerging research indicates that biology routinely uses diffusible redox&#8208;active molecules to mediate communication that can span biological systems (e.g., nervous and immune) and even kingdoms (e.g., a microbiome and its plant/animal host). This redox modality also provides new opportunities to create interactive materials that can communicate with living systems. Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H2O2 signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O2 to generate H2O2. Electron&#8208;transfer from an Escherichia coli culture poises this film to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.

         <title>A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported.








Abstract
The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous&#8208;based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the passive solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.

         <title>Touch&#8208;Based Stressless Cortisol Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stress&#8208;free detection of cortisol using natural figure sweat is reported. Using an electrodeposited molecularly imprinted polymer with an embedded Prussian blue probe for label&#8208;free sensing and a highly permeable hydrogel for rapid natural sweat extraction from the fingertip, the sensor, in both strip and stretchable patch form factors, can detect the cortisol level in 3.5&#160;min with a simple touch.








Abstract
Tracking fluctuations of the cortisol level is important in understanding the body's endocrine response to stress stimuli. Traditional cortisol sensing relies on centralized laboratory settings, while wearable cortisol sensors are limited to slow and complex assays. Here, a touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor for rapid, simple, and reliable stress&#8208;free detection of sweat cortisol is described. The sensor readily measures fingertip sweat cortisol via highly selective binding to the cortisol&#8208;imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating. The MIP network is embedded with Prussian blue redox probes that offer direct electrical signaling of the binding event to realize sensitive label&#8208;free amperometric detection. Using a highly permeable sweat&#8208;wicking porous hydrogel, instantaneously secreted fingertip sweat can be conveniently and rapidly collected without any assistance. By eliminating time lags, such rapid (3.5&#160;min) fingertip assay enables the capture of sharp variations in cortisol levels, compared to previous methods. Such advantages are demonstrated by tracking cortisol response in short cold&#8208;pressor tests and throughout day&#8208;long circadian rhythm, along with gold&#8208;standard immunoassay validation. A stretchable epidermal MIP sensor is also described for directly tracking cortisol in exercise&#8208;induced sweat. The rapid touch&#8208;based cortisol sensor offers an attractive, accessible, stressless avenue for quantitative stress management.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence Rebrightening the Prospects of Stress Sensing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing exhibits many advantages, including remoteness, spatial distribution, stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. With great potential in wearable device, biomechanics, and engineering structure diagnosis applications, it is reasonable to believe that the mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing may rebrighten the prospects of stress sensing.








Abstract
The emergence of new applications, such as in artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and biotechnology, has driven the evolution of stress sensing technology. For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML&#8208;based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.

At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML&#8208;based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Leveraging on ENZ Metamaterials to Achieve 2D and 3D Hyper&#8208;Resolution in Two&#8208;Photon Direct Laser Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is enhanced to hyper&#8208;resolution by leveraging on the extraordinary laser writing collimation enabled by &#949;NZ metamaterials. The realization of ultrathin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses and a highly detailed Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221; bas&#8208;relief (500 nm full height) confirms full freedom in nanofabrication. These results show intriguing cues in trendsetting research scenarios and industry application.








Abstract
A novel technique is developed to improve the resolution of two&#8208;photon direct laser writing lithography. Thanks to the high collimation enabled by extraordinary &#949;NZ (near&#8208;zero) metamaterial features, ultrathin dielectric hyper&#8208;resolute nanostructures are within reach. With respect to the standard direct laser writing approach, a size reduction of 89% and 50%, in height and width respectively, is achieved with the height of the structures adjustable between 5 and 50&#160;nm. The retrieved 2D fabrication parameters are exploited for realizing extremely thin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses tailored through deep machine learning codes. The hyper&#8208;resolution achieved in the writing process enables the fabrication of a highly detailed dielectric 3D bas&#8208;relief (with full height of 500&#160;nm) of Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results show intriguing cues for the current and trendsetting research scenario in anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications and ultracompact photonics, paving the way for the realization of all&#8208;dielectric and apochromatic ultrathin imaging&#160;systems.

         <title>Antimony Nanopolyhedrons with Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances for Highly Effective Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Photothermal/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins is reported, able to detect thermal degradation within widely used poly(ester imide) (PEI) resins. Trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products. Solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy is able to monitor long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.








Abstract
Monitoring polymer degradation is an important quest, particularly relevant for industry. Although many indirect methodologies for assessing polymer degradation exist, only few are applicable for an inline&#8208;monitoring via optic detection&#8208;systems. An inline&#8208;monitoring system is introduced for the thermal degradation of crosslinked poly(ester imide)s (PEIs) by embedding trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbene molecules, serving as chemosensors to track the release of generated alcoholic byproducts. Nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the sensors trifluoroacetyl functionality triggers hemiacetal formation which is accompanied by significant changes in optical properties, in turn allowing monitoring of sensor activation by direct spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers an easy detection tool for the inline thermal monitoring of PEI&#8208;degradation.

         <title>Superkinetic Growth of Oval Organic Semiconductor Microcrystals for Chaotic Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superkinetic crystal growth strategy is developed to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces by breaking the crystal growth anisotropy. The oval organic semiconductor microcrystals constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators, which enable low&#8208;threshold directional lasing.








Abstract
Synthesis of novel mesoscopic semiconductor architectures continually generates new photonic knowledge and applications. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces owing to the crystal growth anisotropy. Here, a superkinetic crystal growth method is developed to synthesize 2D oval organic semiconductor microcrystals. The solid source dispersion induces an exceptionally large molecular supersaturation for vapor deposition, which breaks the crystal growth anisotropy. The synthesized stadium&#8208;shaped organic semiconductor microcrystals naturally constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators. They support low&#8208;threshold lasing on high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor scar modes localized near the stadium boundary and directional laser emission assisted by the chaotic modes. These results will reshape the understanding of the crystal growth theory and provide valuable guidance for crystalline photonic materials design.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Sub&#8208;Micrometer Particles by Modifying the Excess&#8208;Li Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathode for a practical Li&#8208;ion battery system through a novel structural and morphological design is reported: a relatively delocalized excess&#8208;Li system in sub&#8208;micrometer particles. The lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized LMR exhibits an outstanding energy density over other prospective cathode materials, and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention in full&#8208;cells in practical conditions.








Abstract
In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li1.11Mn0.49Ni0.29Co0.11O2, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li&lt;sub&gt;1.11&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.49&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.29&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Challenges and Recent Advances in High Capacity Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical applications of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, are hindered by their inherent shortcomings. In this case, the recent understanding of complex reaction mechanisms, the novel modification methods, and the corresponding development trends are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, other branches and the future opportunities of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&gt;250&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Techniques for Printing of Functional Inks for Flexible Physical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of droplet&#8208;based printing techniques, namely inkjet, aerosol jet, and E&#8208;jet, are reviewed in depth. Furthermore, other important aspects of printed electronics such as functional inks, sintering methods, and flexible substrates are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques, and main challenges toward printed electronics are also reviewed.








Abstract
Printed electronics (PE) is an emerging technology that uses functional inks to print electrical components and circuits on variety of substrates. This technology has opened up new possibilities to fabricate flexible, bendable, and form&#8208;fitting devices at low&#8208;cost and fast speed. There are different printing technologies in use, among which droplet&#8208;based techniques are of great interest as they provide the possibility of printing computer&#8208;controlled design patterns with high resolution, and greater production flexibility. Nanomaterial inks form the heart of this technology, enabling different functionalities. To this end, intensive research has been carried out on formulating inks with conductive, semiconductive, magnetic, piezoresistive, and piezoelectric properties. Here, a detailed landscape view on different droplet&#8208;based printing technologies (inkjet, aerosol jet, and electrohydrodynamic jet) is provided, with comprehensive discussion on their working principals. This is followed by a detailed research overview of different functional inks (metal, carbon, polymer, and ceramic). Different sintering methods and common substrates being used in printed electronics are also discussed, followed by an in&#8208;depth review of different physical sensors fabricated by droplet&#8208;based techniques. Finally, the challenges facing the field are considered and a perspective on possible ways to overcome them is provided.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG)&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG&#8208;based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User&#8208;friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self&#8208;care capabilities.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.

         <title>Recent Development of Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers requires a fundamental understanding of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, which is the primary focus of this review. The water electrolyzer in alkaline and acid are compared; and the recent advances in OER mechanisms, the strategies for enhancing activity and stability of electrocatalysts, surface reconstruction, and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one of the most promising hydrogen production techniques. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure&#8211;activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based OER catalysts and the current progress of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.
