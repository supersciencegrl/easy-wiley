         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogels featuring a &#8220;porous brick and fiber&#8221; architecture are fabricated via in situ nanoscale hetero&#8208;assembly and ambient pressure drying, in which mesoporous minerals are generated in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The aerogels integrate challenging requirements of thermal superinsulation, excellent compressive stiffness, superelasticity, high bending flexibility, good impact resistance, and easy scalability for robust thermal management under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel, synthesized via in situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network, is reported. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8211;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulting aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). These aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Piezoelectric BiO2&#8722;x Nanosheets for Augmented Piezocatalytic, Sonothermal, and Enzymatic Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheet is developed by a defect engineering strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lowering the energy gap, and is applied for the synergistic piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies. Density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancies are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy is a new&#8208;emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;enabled therapeutic strategy that relies on built&#8208;in electric field and energy&#8208;band bending of piezoelectric materials activated by ultrasound (US) irradiation. Despite becoming a hot topic, material development and mechanism exploration are still underway. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheets (NSs) demonstrate outstanding piezoelectric properties. Under US, a piezo&#8208;potential of 0.25&#160;V for BiO2&#8722;x NSs is sufficient to tilt the conduction band to be more negative than the redox potentials of O2/&#8226;O2&#8722;, &#8226;O2&#8722;/H2O2, and H2O2/&#8226;OH, which initiates a cascade reaction for ROS generation. Moreover, the BiO2&#8722;x NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase&#8208;like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H2O2&#8208;overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO2&#8722;x NSs are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Flat&#8208;Panel Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick&#8208;film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based single&#8208;pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new&#8208;generation&#160;X&#8208;ray&#8208;detection systems.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Fingerprint Retrieval Using Strongly Detuned Overcoupled Plasmonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantenna design strategy based on loss engineering is proposed. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the absorption fingerprints of various molecules are successfully detected and distinguished.








Abstract
Tailoring light&#8208;matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light&#8208;matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency, resulting in a weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, it is demonstrated that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC&#8208;PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic&#8208;molecular detuning. In OC&#8208;PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248&#160;cm&#8722;1, which is 173&#160;cm&#8722;1 wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC&#8208;PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain a lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC&#8208;PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms. This work gains new insights into detuning&#8208;state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring light-matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light-matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency, resulting in a weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, it is demonstrated that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC-PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic-molecular detuning. In OC-PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 173&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC-PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain a lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid-infrared range. In the proof-of-concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC-PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine-learning algorithms. This work gains new insights into detuning-state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for&#160;Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as a prototype, oxygen vacancies are found to introduce shallow energy levels, and deep energy levels are identified. More surface oxygen vacancies induces the formation of deeper surface trapped states to enhance charge separation and introduce more low&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr centers to boost water oxidation activity.








Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. In this work, the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) are regulated via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. Oxygen vacancies identified in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere induces the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of the PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in the PbCrO4 photoanode, a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated AM1.5G is acheived. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing the water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Design of Fluoro&#8208;Free Surfaces Super&#8208;Repellent to Low&#8208;Surface&#8208;Tension Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread use of perfluoroalkyls for super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces is environmentally unsustainable, motivating the exploration of fluoro&#8208;free alternatives. In this work, the concept of liquid&#8208;centric design and the revised limits for using fluoro&#8208;free materials (hydrocarbons and silicones) in achieving super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids is demonstrated. Scale bar in image: 1 mm. 








Abstract
Super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces feature high liquid contact angles and low sliding angles find key applications in anti&#8208;fouling and self&#8208;cleaning. While repellency for water is easily achieved with hydrocarbon functionalities, repellency for many low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (down to 30 mN&#160;m&#8722;1) still requires perfluoroalkyls (a persistent environmental pollutant and bioaccumulation hazard). Here, the scalable room&#8208;temperature synthesis of stochastic nanoparticle surfaces with fluoro&#8208;free moieties is investigated. Silicone (dimethyl and monomethyl) and hydrocarbon surface chemistries are benchmarked against perfluoroalkyls, assessed using model low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (ethanol&#8211;water mixtures). It is discovered that both hydrocarbon&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;silicone&#8208;based functionalization can achieve super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency down to 40&#8211;41 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 and 32&#8211;33 mN&#160;m&#8722;1, respectively (vs&#160;27&#8211;32 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 for perfluoroalkyls). The dimethyl silicone variant demonstrates superior fluoro&#8208;free liquid repellency likely due to its denser dimethyl molecular configuration. It is shown that perfluoroalkyls are not necessary for many real&#8208;world scenarios requiring super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency. Effective super&#8208;repellency of different surface chemistries against different liquids can be adequately predicted using empirically verified phase diagrams. These findings encourage a liquid&#8208;centric design, i.e., tailoring surfaces for target liquid properties. Herein, key guidelines are provided for achieving functional yet sustainably designed super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Energy Transfer between Dye&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles: Observation and Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operating range of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5 nm. A study of dye&#8208;loaded fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles connected by DNA duplexes of different lengths reveals efficient energy transfer far beyond the F&#246;rster radius, following a power&#8208;four distance dependence. This phenomenon is applied for amplified detection of a target nucleic acid with attomole sensitivity.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light&#8208;harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5&#160;nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic F&#246;rster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP&#8211;NP distances&#160;of 15 and 20&#160;nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface NP&#8211;NP distance. Based on this long&#8208;distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at &#8776;15&#160;nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single&#8208;molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for &gt;5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection. Breaking the F&#246;rster distance limit for ultrabright NPs opens the route to advanced optical nanomaterials for amplified FRET&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>From Nanoalloy to Nano&#8208;Laminated Interfaces for Highly Stable Alkali&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces is proposed for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes, tailoring the compositions from nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure. The required thicknesses for nanoalloy interfaces differ from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;metal anodes, and the mechanical stabilities of the interfaces affect electrochemical performances.









Abstract
Metal anodes are considered the holy grail for next&#8208;generation batteries because of their high gravimetric/volumetric specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, several unsolved challenges have impeded their practical applications, such as dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, dead layer formation, and volume change. An electrochemically, chemically, and mechanically stable artificial solid electrolyte interphase&#160;is key to addressing the aforementioned issue with metal anodes. This study demonstrates a new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes. Through tailoring the compositions of the hybrid interfaces, a nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure is realized. As a result, the nanoalloy interface (1Al2O3&#8211;1alucone or 2Al2O3&#8211;2alucone) presents the most stable electrochemical performances for both Li&#8208;and Na&#8208;metal anodes. The optimized thicknesses required for the nanoalloy interfaces for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes are different. A cohesive zone model is applied to interpret the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the mechanical stabilities of the different interfaces on the electrochemical performances is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This approach provides a fundamental understanding and establishes the bridge between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance for alkali&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Organic Sonodynamic Materials for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising non&#8208;invasive therapeutic modality to treat deep&#8208;seated tumors owing to the good tissue penetration ability and spatiotemporal controllability of ultrasound (US); however, the low sonodynamic activity and potential side effects greatly limit its clinical translation. Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with SDT for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. In this review, we discuss the convergence of SDT with cancer immunotherapy to exert their merits and break through the limitations of combination cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. We focus on the development and construction of organic materials with high sonodynamic activity and immunotherapeutic efficiency. These organic materials not only induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor immunogenicity via SDT but also activate antitumor immunity via immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;mediated immune pathway modulation. The combination of various immuno&#8208;oncology drugs with organic sonosensitizers is categorized and discussed along with the prospects and challenges for clinical translation.

Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of novel A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8208;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8208;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23&#160;eV and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. We achieved SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ, with emission peaks at 1140&#160;nm and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of &#8764;1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. Our work demonstrates that A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8208;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

&lt;p&gt;Short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy-gap law, achieving high-brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of novel A-D-A&#8242;-D-A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high-performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D-A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23&#160;eV and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. We achieved SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ, with emission peaks at 1140&#160;nm and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll-off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of &#8764;1.12&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, we design Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. Our study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;rousing.</title>

Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, we propose a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converted endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generated a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics revealed that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricted the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promoted bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potentials as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance towards glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#8208;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. Our work could pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li2MnO3. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li2MnO3&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&#63743;O bonds and smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.








Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here, the tuning capability of anionic redox is shown by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, it is quantitatively revealed that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles and larger Li&#63743;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tuning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Tailored 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites for Reconfigurable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic study of reconfigurable optoelectronic properties based on a nontrivial library of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with diamino group ligands by exposing/removing moisture is presented. The key to the moisture&#8208;controlled reconfigurable properties lies in the formation of hydrogen bonding between the diamino group and water molecules, preventing their escape.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208; and moisture&#8208;induced degradation has been a longstanding problem in perovskite materials, affecting their long&#8208;term stability during applications. Counterintuitively, the moisture is leveraged to tailor the reversible hydrochromic behaviors of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites for reconfigurable optoelectronics. In particular, the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and water molecules can be dynamically modulated via moisture removal/exposure. Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.

Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first-principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, an anti-counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti-counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular orbital interactions are demonstrated to be crucial to the energy gap and spectral bandwidth of multi&#8208;resonance emitters. Correspondingly, the first indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole embedded green fluorophore is developed with the smallest full width at half maximum of 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV), accompanied by high external quantum efficiency of 30.9% and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with redshifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1&#8208;jk)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &amp;lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1-&lt;i&gt;jk&lt;/i&gt;)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &amp;gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light-emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &amp;lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8208;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Efficient Inorganic Vapor&#8208;Assisted Defects Passivation for Perovskite Solar Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CS2 vapor passivation strategy is proposed to reduce defects in FAPbI3 films. It is revealed that the CS2 can strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to facilitate the carrier transport, resulting in remarkably enhance efficiency of the devices (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2).








Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

         <title>Extremely Tough, Stretchable Gel Electrolytes with Strong Interpolymer Hydrogen Bonding Prepared Using Concentrated Electrolytes to Stabilize Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes are prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used as an artificial protective layer for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel&#8208;coated Li&#8208;metal anode considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell as well as a Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NMC622) full cell.








Abstract
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes, which can be prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated lithium (Li)&#8208;salt electrolytes, are reported. These electrolytes can be realized by optimizing the competitive hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between polymer chains, solvent molecules, Li cations, and counteranions. Free polar solvent molecules, which typically impede interpolymer hydrogen bonding, are scarce in concentrated electrolytes; this feature can be exploited to prepare hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel electrolytes with unprecedented toughness. In contrast, free solvent molecules are abundant in electrolytes with typical concentrations, yielding considerably weaker gel electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used an artificial protective layer for Li&#8208;metal anodes, as it considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell through uniform Li deposition/dissolution. Additionally, employing the gel electrolyte as the protecting layer significantly improves the cycling performance of the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 full cell.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials typically lose their water sorption capability with increasing temperature. Can this temperature effect be reversed? By leveraging the phase transformation of semicrystalline hydrogels, an unusual water sorption behavior is demonstrated where the water uptake can be doubled with an increased temperature of 25&#160;&#176;C. This finding will enable a new degree of freedom to harness moisture and heat.








Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications, including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and to enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#160;&#176;C, is reported. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8211;polymer interactions, this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures, and the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development are identified. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Artificial Tendrils Mimicking Plant Movements by Mismatching Modulus and Strain in Core and Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological principles of tendril movement and coiling in plants are studied and used as design criteria to implement coiling movements in an artificial multimaterial fiber (MMFs) system. The MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core and an elastic shell, such that the core enables the implementation of strain displacement in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible coiling movement.








Abstract
Motile organs have evolved in climbing plants enabling them to find a support and, after secure attachment, to reach for sunlight without investing in a self&#8208;supporting stem. Searching movements, the twining of stems, and the coiling of tendrils are involved in successful plant attachment. Such coiling movements have great potential in robotic applications, especially if they are reversible. Here, the underlying mechanism of tendril movement based on contractile fibers is reported, as illustrated by a function&#8211;morphological analysis of tendrils in several liana species and the encoding of such a principle in a core&#8211;shell multimaterial fiber (MMF) system. MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core fiber (SMCF) and an elastic shell. The shape&#8208;memory effect of the core fibers enables the implementation of strain mismatch in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible motion. The produced MMFs show coiling and/or uncoiling behavior, with a high reversible actuation magnitude of &#8776;400%, which is almost 20 times higher compared with similar stimuli for sensitive soft actuators. The movements in these MMFs rely on the crystallization/melting behavior of oriented macromolecules of SMCF.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of graphene biointerfaces for cardiac electrophysiology is presented. The devices feature effective electrochemical properties: low impedance and high charge storage and injection capacities.

Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, a graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology is reported for the first time. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart are demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted) is demonstrated. The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40&#160;&#937;&#8201;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2, and charge injection capacity up to 704&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. The report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is created, based on which low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record&#8208;high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and a long operational lifetime (LT50&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of reconfigurable multilevel optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the stochastic crystallization of supersaturated solution, intended for a hierarchical identification process with recyclable tokens, is presented. The global parameters introduced in this study act as prefixes to classify PUFs into subgroups, which allows for a fast authentication process.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are&#160;emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) is presented that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, the S&#8208;PUF now includes two global parameters, that is, angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these parameters function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) is realized by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a record high through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 15% higher than that of pure Indium foil (81.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1).








Abstract
Excellent through&#8208;plane thermally conductive composites are highly demanded for efficient heat dissipation. Giant sheets have large crystalline domain and significantly reduce interface phonon scattering, making them promising to build highly thermally conductive composites. However, realizing vertical orientation of giant sheets remains challenging due to their enormous mass and huge hydrodynamic drag force. Here,&#160;we&#160;achieve highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a recorded through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Microscale shearing fields induced by vertical motion of microwires conquer huge hydrodynamic energy barrier and vertically reorient giant sheets. The resulting liquid crystals exhibit extremely retarded relaxation and impart large&#8208;scale vertical array with bidirectional ordering degree as high as 0.82. The graphite array&#8208;based composites demonstrate an ultrahigh thermal enhancement efficiency of over 35 times per unit volume. Furthermore, the composites improve cooling efficiency by 93% for thermal management tests compared to commercial thermal interface materials. This work offers a novel methodology to precisely manipulate the orientation of giant particles and promote large&#8208;scale fabrication of vertical array with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

     alt="Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N-Doping of Organic Semiconductors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra-efficient n-dopants for OSCs is reported. In-depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record-high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation-induced nucleophilic-attack n-doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n-doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2-t-Bu and P4-t-Bu as ultra-efficient n-dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n-type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2-t-Bu-doped PC&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;BM reaches a record-high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The polaron generation efficiency of P2-t-Bu-doped in PC&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n-dopant N-DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation-initiated, nucleophilic-attack-based n-doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds, and the subsequent n-doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n-dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n-dopants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High Quantum Efficiency Broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ Phosphor Through Lithium&#8208;Ion Compensation</title>

         <dc:description>
A blue light excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped&#160;Mg4Ta2O9phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium&#8208;ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next&#8208;generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one photoresist for 3D direct laser writing applications is introduced, which allows the degradation properties of the printed structure to be carefully tuned by simply altering the laser intensity during the fabrication process. The unique ability to fabricate 3D microstructures consisting of both degradable and nondegradable segments from a single photoresist is a critical advancement in photoresist technology.








Abstract
A photoresist&#8212;based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes&#8212;whose ability to intrinsically degrade postprinting can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography is introduced. The resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark is transformed into a tunable degradable 3D printing material platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via atomic force microscopy before and during degradation reveals the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, it is possible to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures. This simplifies the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multifunctional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and nondegradable material sections.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high&#8208;throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.








Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is developed, which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10 &#177; 1, 15 &#177; 1, 17 &#177; 2, or 36 &#177; 1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%).

     alt="High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bs&lt;/sub&gt;) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber-based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bs&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with up-to-date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Improved Carrier Management via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed by introducing a one&#8208;in&#8208;all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl&#8208;processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management, including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer, is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Herein, a carrier management strategy is reported for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt;8&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell, a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device is further demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
A series of multifunctional STOPVs for smart windows are presented, based on strong resonance effect of asymmetrical MIM microcavities. These devices present a recorded QUE of 80%, flowery trans&#8208;reflective structural colors scanning visible region, superior UV&#8208;blocking (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) of 95%, and IR&#8208;rejection (700&#8211;1400&#160;nm) of 100%, of which, the rear two performances are individually better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial optical films for solar window.








Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

Engineering electronic defects in ZnO&#8211;Fe2O3 superlattice heterointerfaces is applied for smartphone&#8208;/solar&#8208;triggered bactericidal and virucidal touchscreens, even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen exhibits excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, a ZnO&#63743;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm is designed via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface are engineered. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#63743;O, Fe&#63743;O, and Zn&#63743;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8722;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a high&#160;cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>In a high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se, a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric transition is demonstrated by the appearance of butterfly loops and 180&#176; phase switching in the piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, together with the evolution of optical second&#8208;harmonic generation. Materials with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and ferroelectrics under strain are rare.








Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, is presented. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819;400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180&#176; phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second&#8208;harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. This work adds a new degree of freedom to HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductors, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <dc:description>
An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators benefit from high actuation strain and mechanical properties that mimic biological tissues but suffer from low actuation rates and limited controllability. It is shown that the performance of hydrogel actuators can be improved by orders of magnitude using uniaxial fibrillar hydrogels that focus the entire swelling in the actuation direction&#8211;a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, their actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, it is shown that organizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anisotropic hydrogel sheets leads to mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;130%&#160;s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1%&#160;s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure reaches 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the maximum&#160;pressure is 1&#8211;2&#160;min, compared to 10&#160;min to hours for polymer hydrogel actuators. Uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120&#160;000 times their weight and soft grippers are showcased. In addition, the hydrogels can be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allows adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement towards hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Electrochemical Catalysts for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>

Molecular design and crystal engineering strategy are applied to construct thiol&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This MOF platform is successfully decorated with&#160;nickel&#8211;sulfur links cooperating in the network. The prepared 2D MOF with enhanced electro&#8208;conductivity and modified electronic structure demonstrates superior activity and robust stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which paves the way to design MOFs at a molecular level.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8211;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous&#8208;rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8211;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Membranes Enabled High Energy Density in PEI&#8208;Based Composites for High&#8208;Temperature Electrostatic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sandwich structured BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT)/polyetherimide&#8211;boron nitride composites are prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique with water&#8208;dissolvent transfer method and hot&#8208;pressing process. By inserting the single&#8208;crystalline BZT membranes as the inner layer, the composites exhibit good dielectric&#8208;temperature stability and ultra&#8208;high energy&#8208;density. This study paves a scalable way to develop novel high&#8208;temperature dielectric materials and capacitors with superior energy storage performance.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant are fabricated, and introduced into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8211;BN/BZT/PEI&#8211;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at 730&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25&#160;and 150&#160;&#176;C. An outstanding Ue&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

         <title>A Microbial Community Cultured in Gradient Hydrogel for Investigating Gut Microbiome&#8208;Drug Interaction and Guiding Therapeutic Decisions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient hydrogel&#8208;based microbial community is presented to simulate the real intestinal microbiome for bridging microbiome&#8208;drug interaction research and treatment decision. This model reveals three mechanisms of drug&#8208;microbiota interaction: immunological effect, bio&#8208;accumulation, and drug metabolism, which provide innovative regulatory approaches for improving the anti&#8208;cancer effect of drugs.








Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom&#8208;tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8211;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>A Sulfur Heterocyclic Quinone Cathode Towards&#160;High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

A fully composited benzo[b]naphtho[2',3':5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO)&#160;is designed to simultaneously conquer the low utilization of active sites, intrinsic poor conductivity, and strong solubility of organic electrode materials, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with record&#8208;high cycling stability. This work brings new opportunities for the exploration of ultra&#8208;stable organic cathode materials for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure is synthesized and composited with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/RGO composite exhibits a high capacity of 296&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy that enables effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Tuning 2D Magnetism in Cobalt Monoxide Nanosheets Via In Situ Nickel&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide (Ni&#8208;doped CoO) nanosheets with a high substitution doping concentration is proposed for the first time. 2D Ni&#8208;doped CoO exhibits obvious ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K, in sharp contrast to the pristine non&#8208;ferromagnetic 2D CoO, opening up a prospective way for tuning the magnetism of 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.








Abstract
Element doping has become an effective strategy to engineer the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) materials and is widely explored in van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the high&#8208;concentration substitution doping of 2D nonlayered metal oxides, which can preserve the original crystal texture and guarantee the homogeneity of doping distribution, is still a critical challenge due to the isotropic bonding of closed&#8208;packed structures. In this work, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D nonlayered nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide nanosheets via in situ atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method is reported. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nickel atoms are doped at the intrinsic cobalt atom sites. The nickel doping concentration is stable at &#8776;15%, superior to most magnetic dopants doping in 2D materials and metal oxides. Magnetic measurements showed that pristine cobalt monoxide is nonferromagnetic, whereas nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide exhibits robust ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that nickel atoms can improve the internal ferromagnetic correlation, giving rise to significant ferromagnetic performance of cobalt monoxide nanosheets. These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high&#8208;quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global T&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&#8722;1. The discovered materials are then accessed for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enables Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8211;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified&#160;LCO has a gradient doping of Mg, uniform doping of Ni in Li layers, and uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating. The doping and coating simultaneously modify the band structure to improve the oxygen redox reversibility during cycles. Therefore, the modified LCO shows excellent cycling performance both at 4.6 V and 4.7 V.








Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3 V. Lifting the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO from 4.3 V to 4.7 V will increase the specific capacity from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8208;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7 V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7 V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers inhibit the harmful phase transitions of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

Immunotherapy
In article 2212267, Haihua Xiao, Nianzeng Xing, and co&#8208;workers present a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Perovskite Solar Modules
In article number 2211593, Yang Wang, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy of vapor&#8208;assisted defect passivation to manage defects in perovskite solar modules. CS2 can strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the device efficiency (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2).

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Paper&#8208;based Laser&#8208;pyrolyzed Electrofluidics: An Electrochemical Platform for Capillary&#8208;driven Diagnostic Bioassays</title>

Abstract
Microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices (&#956;PADs) are indispensable tools for disease diagnostics. The integration of electronic components into &#956;PADs enables new device functionalities and facilitates the development of complex quantitative assays. Unfortunately, current electrode fabrication methods often hinder capillary flow, considerably restricting &#956;PAD design architectures. Here, we present laser&#8208;induced graphenization as an approach to fabricate porous electrodes embedded into cellulose paper. The resulting electrodes not only have high conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also retain wetting properties for capillary transport. We demonstrate paper&#8208;based electrofluidics, including (i) a lateral flow device for injection analysis of alkaline phosphatase in serum and (ii) a vertical flow device for quantitative detection of HPV16 with a CRISPR&#8208;based assay. We expect that this platform will streamline the development of diagnostic devices that combine the operational simplicity of colorimetric lateral flow tests with the added benefits and possibilities offered by electronic signaling.

         <title>The importance of effective ligand concentration to direct epithelial cell polarity in dynamic hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Epithelial cysts and organoids are multicellular hollow structures formed by correctly polarized epithelial cells. Important in steering these cysts from single cells is the dynamic regulation of extracellular matrix presented ligands, and matrix dynamics. Here, we&#160;introduce control over the effective ligand concentration, decoupled from bulk and local mechanical properties, in synthetic dynamic supramolecular hydrogels formed through non&#8208;covalent crosslinking of supramolecular fibers. Control over the effective ligand concentration is realized by (1) keeping the ligand concentration constant, but changing the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules or by (2) varying the ligand concentration, while keeping the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules constant. Our&#160;results show that in 2D, the effective ligand concentration within our&#160;supramolecular fibers rather than gel stiffness (from 0.1 to 8&#160;kPa) regulates epithelial polarity. In 3D, increasing the effective ligand concentration from 0.5 to 2&#160;mM strengthens the effect of increased gel stiffness from 0.1 to 2&#160;kPa, to synergistically yield more correctly polarized cysts. Through integrin manipulation, we&#160;show that epithelial polarity is regulated by tension&#8208;based homeostasis between cells and matrix. Our&#160;results reveal the effective ligand concentration as influential factor in regulating epithelial polarity and provide insights on engineering of synthetic biomaterials for cell and organoid culture.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics: Combination of diagnosis, therapy, and regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation (bioinert, white in color)&#8212;bulk materials like alumina and zirconia to the third (white in color)&#8212;3D scaffolds capable of driving tissue regeneration. However, most of those bioceramics are limited to dental restoration and bone tissue regeneration. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics&#8212;yellow, green, blue, grey, black, etc.&#8212;found recently their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and NIR regions making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, and diagnostic while preserving the regenerative properties. Oxygen deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8208;x, MoO3&#8208;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest has yet to scrutinize. In this timely review, the fourth generation of bioceramics is introduced and their compositions, synthesis routes, and diverse biomedical applications are summarized and discussed in detail. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure through easy procedures making them stand out in the biomaterial's family. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review, but these problems come from ceramics generally not the colored ones like brittleness, optimizing porosity versus mechanical properties during the processing, etc. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.








Abstract
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy&#8208;storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+. In this study, an ultrafast, universal, and cost&#8208;effective superfilling approach is developed to construct a metal artificial interface decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and 2D&#160;diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes can be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributes to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled&#8208;up Sn@Zn//&#946;&#8208;MnO2 cells. Given the facile and cost&#8208;effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, this work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialization, and commercialization purposes.

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8211;A&#8208;Type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters toward Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;Area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of interfacial forces during the transfer process, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized, which is compatible with batch production of graphene wafers on target substrates.








Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities is successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles, and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of chemical vaport deposition (CVD) graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>Achieving Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries by a Dual&#8208;Anion Regulated Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte&#160;is developed for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The electrolyte enables fast interfacial kinetics and forms robust inorganic&#8208;rich and highly ion&#8208;conductive electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layers on the surfaces of the electrodes, demonstrates exceptional performance in Li||NCM83 pouch cells, and realizes LMBs&#160;with an ultrahigh capacity of 39.0 Ah and ultrahigh energy density of 521&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) using lithium&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes have been deemed as one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology. However, its practical application is largely hindered by the notorious dendrite growth of lithium&#8208;metal anodes, the fast structure degradation of the cathode, and insufficient electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase kinetics. Here, a dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte is developed for LMBs using lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium difluoro(bisoxalato)phosphate (LiDFBOP) as anion regulators. The incorporation of TFSI&#8722; in the solvation sheath reduces the desolvation energy of Li+, and DFBOP&#8722; promotes the formation of highly ion&#8208;conductive and sustainable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the electrodes. Significantly enhanced performance is demonstrated on Li||LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 pouch cells, with 84.6% capacity retention after 150 cycles in 6.0 Ah pouch cells and an ultrahigh rate capability up to 5 C in 2.0 Ah pouch cells. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an ultralarge capacity of 39.0 Ah is fabricated and achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 521.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The findings provide a facile electrolyte design strategy for promoting the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Enzymatic Regulation of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein is loaded in coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells, and client proteins are taken up based on their affinity for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which can be regulated by their phosphorylation state. Using a kinase or phosphatase, protein&#8211;protein interactions of native interaction domains are regulated in situ. This system mimics the recruitment of client proteins to biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Membraneless organelles are important for spatial organization of proteins and regulation of intracellular processes. Proteins can be recruited to these condensates by specific protein&#8211;protein or protein&#8211;nucleic acid interactions, which are often regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications. However, the mechanisms behind these dynamic, affinity&#8208;based protein recruitment events are not well understood. Here, a coacervate system that incorporates the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein to study enzymatically regulated recruitment of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;binding proteins is presented, which mostly bind in a phosphorylation&#8208;dependent manner. Synthetic coacervates are efficiently loaded with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, and phosphorylated binding partners, such as the c&#8208;Raf pS233/pS259 peptide (c&#8208;Raf), show 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;dependent sequestration with up to 161&#8208;fold increase in local concentration. The c&#8208;Raf domain is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf) to demonstrate recruitment of proteins. In situ phosphorylation of GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf by a kinase leads to enzymatically regulated uptake. The introduction of a phosphatase into coacervates preloaded with the phosphorylated 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf complex results in a significant cargo efflux mediated by dephosphorylation. Finally, the general applicability of this platform to study protein&#8211;protein interactions is demonstrated by the phosphorylation&#8208;dependent and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated active reconstitution of a split&#8208;luciferase inside artificial cells. This work presents an approach to study dynamically regulated protein recruitment in condensates, using native interaction domains.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Release of Nitric Oxide from Hafnium&#8208;Based Nanoradiosensitizers for Enhanced Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but multifunctional hafnium&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer with controlled release of NO under X&#8208;ray irradiation and cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation ability is developed for enhanced radio&#8208;immunotherapy, achieving complete elimination of cancer, especially metastasis.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an extensively used strategy for cancer treatment, but its therapeutic effect is usually limited by the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) and it lacks the ability to control tumor metastases. In this work, a nanoscale coordination polymer, Hf&#8208;nIm@PEG (HNP), is prepared by the coordination of hafnium ions (Hf4+) with 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;nIm), and then modified with lipid bilayers containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, on the one hand, Hf4+ with high computed tomography signal enhancement ability can deposit radiation energy to induce DNA damage, and on the other hand, NO can be persistently released from 2&#8208;nIm, which can not only directly react with the radical DNA to prevent the repair of damaged DNA but also relieves the hypoxic immunosuppressive TME to sensitize radiotherapy. Additionally, NO can also react with superoxide ions to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to induce cell apoptosis. More interestingly, it is discovered that Hf4+ can effectively activate the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to promote the immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Thus, this work presents a simple but multifunctional nanoscale coordination polymer to deposit radiation energy, trigger the release of NO, modulate the TME, activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and finally realize synergistic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
A new strategy, molecular anchoring, is applied to improve the detection and quality of low&#8208;level myoelectric signals through gel electrode interacting with and embedding into stratum corneum. Due to high&#8208;fidelity signals based on the anchoring electrodes, the system enables an amputee to drive a prosthesis with phantom limb dexterity.








Abstract
Myoelectric control utilizes electrical signals generated from the voluntary contraction of remaining muscles in an amputee's stump to operate a prosthesis. Precise and agile control requires low&#8208;level myoelectric signals (below 10% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from weak muscle contractions such as phantom finger or wrist movements, but imbalanced calcium concentration in atrophic skin can distort the signals. This is due to poor ionic&#8211;electronic coupling between skin and electrode, which often causes excessive muscle contraction, fatigue, and discomfort during delicate tasks. To overcome this challenge, a new strategy called molecular anchoring is developed to drive hydrophobic molecular effectively interact with and embed into stratum corneum for high coupling regions between ionic fluxes and electronic currents. The use of hydrophobic poly(N&#8208;vinyl caprolactam) gel has resulted in an interface impedance of 20&#160;k&#937;, which is 1/100 of a commercial acrylic&#8208;based electrode, allowing the detection of ultralow myoelectric signals (&#8776;1.5% MVC) that approach human limits. With this molecular anchoring technology, amputees operate a prosthesis with greater dexterity, as phantom finger and wrist movements are predicted with 97.6% accuracy. This strategy provides the potential for a comfortable human&#8211;machine interface when amputees accomplish day&#8208;to&#8208;day tasks through precise and dexterous myoelectric control.

         <title>Triggering Pt Active Sites in Basal Plane of Van der Waals PtTe2 Materials by Amorphization Engineering for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amorphous strategy is developed to trigger the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms in 2D PtTe2 materials and tailor the electronic properties of Pt active sites via the orbital hybridization with oxygen dopants. O ur findings provide an efficient strategy for designing amorphous catalysts whose number of active sites and adsorption strength to reaction intermediates are significantly increased and optimized.








Abstract
Exposing active sites and optimizing their binding strength to reaction intermediates are two essential strategies to significantly improve the catalytic performance of 2D materials. However, pursuing an efficient way to achieve these goals simultaneously remains a considerable challenge. Here, using 2D PtTe2 van der Waals material with a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, it is observed that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe2 nanosheets (c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped 2D amorphous PtTe2 NSs (a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt&#8208;Te covalent bond in c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, d&#8208;band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals. As a result, a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Mechanically Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cellulose&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8208;Based Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)&#8208;based luminescent shape&#8208;memory polymers are fabricated by integrating the self&#8208;assembly of CNCs with a co&#8208;polymerization strategy. By sequential hot&#8208;pressing and recovery through heating, circularly polarized luminescence can be switched on and off due to the pressure&#8208;responsive chiral nematic structures.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials that display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great attention for application in chiral sensors and smart displays. However, due to difficulties in the regulation of chiral structures, fine control of CPL remains a challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that cellulose nanocrystal shape&#8208;memory polymers (CNC&#8208;SMPs) with luminescent components enable mechanically responsive CPL. The chiral nematic organization of CNCs in the material gives rise to a photonic bandgap. By manipulating the photonic bandgap or luminescence wavelengths of the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs, precise control of CPL emission with varied wavelengths and high dissymmetry factors (glum) is achieved. Specifically, CPL emission can be switched reversibly by treating the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs with hot&#8208;pressing and recovery by heating. Pressure&#8208;responsive CPL with tunable glum values is ascribed to the pressure&#8208;responsive photonic bandgaps. Moreover, colorimetric and CPL&#8208;active patterns are created by imprinting desired forms into SMP samples. This study demonstrates a novel way to fabricate smart CPL systems using biomaterials.

         <title>Physicochemical Dual Cross&#8208;Linking Conductive Polymeric Networks Combining High Strength and High Toughness Enable Stable Operation of Silicon Microparticle Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid) and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber includes robust chemical cross&#8208;linking and multiple physical cross&#8208;linking. Such a design can effectively dissipate the undesirable stress of silicon microparticle anodes by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability.








Abstract
The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycling performance caused by undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) as next&#8208;generation anode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network is designed combining high strength and high toughness by coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid)&#160;and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H&#8208;bonds, by introducing highly branched tannic acid as a physical cross&#8208;linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#181;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8776;97% from 2027.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 19th to 1968.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 200th cycle at 2 A g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stabilizing SiOx anodes with a much lower capacity loss of &#8776;0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress&#8208;distribution ability of the physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network. This work provides an efficient energy&#8208;dissipation strategy toward practical high&#8208;capacity anodes for energy&#8208;dense batteries.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. We demonstrate unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8764;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. Our investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical devices.

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>

Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, we develop photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200 &#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Reactive Deposition Versus Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA): A Key to Highly Active Single Atom co&#8208;Catalysts in Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H2 generation; here SA noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co&#8208;catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes. In the case of TiO2 &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for an adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH3)4Pt]2+ which then are thermally reacted to surface bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work we show by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g. from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H2PtCl6) leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post&#8208;deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well&#8208;connected SA&#8208;anchoring and thus leads to highly active single&#8208;atom sites in photocatalysis.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Carbon Additive Manufacturing with a Near&#8208;Replica &#8220;Green&#8208;to&#8208;Brown&#8221; Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite architected mesoscale process (CAMP) process is reported to manufacture composites with a near&#8208;replica &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, that features a low volume shrinking (9.98%) during &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation. The CAMP manufactures carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/epoxy with a CNTs loading of 25&#160;wt% exhibiting a longitudinal compressive strength of 381 &#177; 30&#160;MPa.








Abstract
Nanocomposites containing nanoscale materials offer exciting opportunities to encode nanoscale features into macroscale dimensions, which produces unprecedented impact in material design and application. However,&#160;conventional methods cannot process nanocomposites with a high particle loading, as well as nanocomposites with the ability to be tailored at multiple scales. A&#160;composite architected mesoscale process strategy that brings particle loading nanoscale materials combined with multiscale features including nanoscale manipulation, mesoscale architecture, and macroscale formation to create spatially programmed nanocomposites with high particle loading and multiscale tailorability is reported. The process features a low&#8208;shrinking (&lt;10%) &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, making a near&#8208;geometric replica of the 3D design to produce a &#8220;brown&#8221; part with full nanomaterials to allow further matrix infill. This demonstration includes additively manufactured carbon nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and thermoset epoxy, leading to multiscale CNTs tailorability, performance improvement, and 3D complex geometry feasibility. The&#160;process can produce nanomaterial&#8208;assembled architectures with 3D geometry and multiscale features and can incorporate a wide range of matrix materials, such as polymers, metals, and ceramics, to fabricate nanocomposites for new device structures and applications.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Cartilage Lacuna&#8208;Inspired Microcarriers Drive Hyaline Neocartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Culturing large&#8208;scale chondrocytes with native phenotypes remains a noteworthy challenge for cartilage tissue engineering. In this work, a novel method to fabricate mimicking cartilage lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) using N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) with mechanotransductive conditions is presented. The data show the advanced capabilities of LHAMCs by presenting the uninterrupted, long&#8208;term culture of chondrocytes to generate an enlarged microtissue with robust chondrogenic capacity.








Abstract
Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS&#8208;ester) are reported. Specifically, carboxyl&#8208;functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide&#8208;crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate forms concave surface of the microcarriers. The temporal 3D culture of chondrocytes on LHAMCs uniquely remodels the extracellular matrix to induce hyaline cartilaginous microtissue regeneration and prevents an anaerobic&#8208;to&#8208;aerobic metabolism transition in response to the geometric constraints. Furthermore, by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway, LHAMCs prevent &#946;&#8208;catenin translocation to the nucleus, repressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Additionally, the subcutaneous implantation model indicates that LHAMCs display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte&#8208;derived neocartilage formation. These findings reveal a novel strategy for regulating chondrocyte dedifferentiation. The current study paves the way for a better understanding of geometrical insight clues into mechanotransduction interaction in regulating cell fate, opening new avenues for advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%.

     alt="Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The in-situ-generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron-transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;F splitting. The lithium-ion storage capacity of MnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium-ion storage capacity of FeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be increased by 33%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low-cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron-transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;F splitting, the lithium-ion storage capacity of MnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the sodium-ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

         <title>Heterostructures Regulating Lithium Polysulfides for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides seriously hinder the development of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Heterostructures, due to unique properties, have congenital advantages that are difficult to be achieved by single&#8208;component materials in regulating lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this review, the principles of heterostructures expediting lithium polysulfides conversion and anchoring lithium polysulfides are detailly analyzed, and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are systematically reviewed. Finally, the problems that need to be solved in the future study and application of heterostructures in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are prospected. This review will provide a valuable reference for the development of heterostructures in advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue, though easy and innocuous, are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multi&#8208;layered skin structure and of the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, first, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the impedances of multi&#8208;layered tissues and apply it to skin. Afterwards, we determine strategies for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, we demonstrate non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues which are beyond orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude (e.g., up to 350 times) higher stratum corneum impedances independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8208;electrodes contact impedances (sweat). Our results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems enabling the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues for several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrical Pulse Synthesis of Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level Hydrogen Gas Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The high reliability and proven ultra&#8208;longevity make aqueous hydrogen gas (H2) batteries ideal for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the low alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) activities of expensive platinum catalyst severely hampered its widespread applications in the H2 batteries. Here, cost&#8208;effective, highly active electrocatalysts, with a model of ruthenium&#8208;nickel alloy nanoparticles in &#8764;3&#160;nm anchored on carbon black (RuNi/C) as an example, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level nickel&#8208;hydrogen gas (Ni&#8211;H2) batteries. Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benchmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV (versus RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. As a result, the advanced Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery can efficiently operate under all&#8208;climate conditions (from &#8208;25 to +50 &#176;C). In addition, this battery shows an excellent durability with negligible capacity and efficiency decay over 1500 cycles at various current densities from 5 to 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, the Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery achieves an cell&#8208;level energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)2 loading of 280&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (60 mAh cm&#8722;2) and a low anode Ru loading of &#8764;62.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2, thereby reaching an estimated cost of the cell stack as low as &#8764;$49.1 kWh&#8722;1, much superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8211;H2 batteries and lithium iron phosphate batteries. The advanced beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>A personalized cancer vaccine that induces synergistic innate and adaptive immune responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, we present&#160;extracellular nanovesicles&#160;derived from&#160;alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC)&#160;as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engaged with and activated both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently served as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that could directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multi&#8208;faceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination resulted in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activated iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient-specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, we present&#160;extracellular nanovesicles&#160;derived from&#160;alpha-galactosylceramide-conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC)&#160;as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient-specific neoantigens. ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC vaccination directly engaged with and activated both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long-term anti-leukemic immune memory. ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC sufficiently served as an antigen-presenting platform that could directly activate antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multi-faceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GC vaccination resulted in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia-free survivors among cytarabine-treated hosts with AML. Human AML-derived ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GCs activated iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML-derived ECNV-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML-specific long-term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using Proton as Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, non&#8208;flammability and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as a fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites and abundant resources, are considered as attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, as far as application is concerned, the charge storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs is still in infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+ storage mechanisms are significant for the applications of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progresses on organic materials such as small molecules and polymers for APBs are reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially on their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Precise Strain Tuning Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strain engineering has been utilized as an effective approach to regulate the binding of reaction intermediates and modify catalytic behavior on noble metal nanocatalysts. However, the continuous, precise control of strain for a depiction of strain&#8208;activity correlation remains a challenge. Herein, Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir overlayers are constructed, and subject to different post&#8208;synthetic treatments to alter the amount of H intercalated into Pd core for achieving three different surface strains (o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.2%, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7%, and o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;2.1% NPs). We demonstrate that the catalytic performances on o&#8208;Pd/Ir NPs display a volcano&#8208;shaped curve against strains towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7% NPs exhibit superior catalytic performance with a mass activity of 9.38 A mgIr&#8211;1 at &#8211;0.02&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 10.8&#8208; and 18.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, making it one of the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Density function theory (DFT) calculations verify that the moderate tensile strain on Ir(111) surfaces plays a pivotal role in optimizing the H binding energy. This work highlights a new strategy for the precise control over surface strain of nanocrystal for more efficient electrocatalysis.

Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8208;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics, enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>

Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. Herein, we report an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibited dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping had considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, we propose a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood. Using LPS extracted from E. coli as an example, we discover a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU/mL in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearrance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are strong candidates for next&#8208;generation display and lighting technologies due to their high color purity and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. However, PeLEDs are not superior to commercial organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in efficiency, as some key parameters affecting their efficiency, such as the charge carrier transport and light outcoupling efficiency, are usually overlooked and not well optimized. Here, we report ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with quantum efficiencies surpassing a milestone of 30% by regulating the charge carrier transport and near&#8208;field light distribution to reduce electron leakage and achieve a high light outcoupling efficiency of 41.82%. We apply Ni0.9Mg0.1Ox films with a high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility as the hole injection layer to balance the charge carrier injection and insert the polyethylene glycol layer between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emissive layer to block the electron leakage and reduce the photon loss. Therefore, with the modified structure, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs achieve a world&#8208;record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% (average&#8201; = &#8201;29.05 &#177; 0.77%) at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd/m2. This work provides an interesting idea to construct super high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs by balancing the electron&#8208;hole recombination and enhancing the light outcoupling.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted an increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and 3D triangular crystals formed by the reaction between ultra&#8208;thin films of MoO3 grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment. The multilayer nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#956;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer edges, forming a monolayer&#8208;multilayer MoS2 junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges of the nanoribbons show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A pronounced splitting of the Raman spectra was observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the monolayer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the triangular MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#215;102 A/W at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. Our findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Se Nano&#8208;Powder Conversion into Lubricious 2D Selenide Layers by Tribochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, we describe an innovative in&#8208;operando conversion of Se nano&#8208;powders into lubricious 2D selenides by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in shear&#8208;induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nano&#8208;powders. The use of Se nano&#8208;powder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nano&#8208;powder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of TMD&#8208;lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in&#8208;operando and exploit their friction&#8208; and wear reducing impact.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, we describe an innovative &lt;i&gt;in-operando&lt;/i&gt; conversion of Se nano-powders into lubricious 2D selenides by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in shear-induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nano-powders. The use of Se nano-powder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nano-powder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long-lasting problem of TMD-lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs &lt;i&gt;in-operando&lt;/i&gt; and exploit their friction- and wear reducing impact.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organogel artificial muscle is created through combining rational macromolecular design and twist insertion. Such tissue&#8208;like material (Young's modulus&#160;=&#160;133&#160;kPa) can generate ultra&#8208;large actuation strain (66%), ultra&#8208;fast actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), high power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), high actuation stress (0.23&#160;MPa), excellent work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), and highly stable actuation in the open&#8208;air environment.








Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8211;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8208;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power, and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG) is reported. Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments is successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale observation directly shows that a significant amount of oxygen loss is induced exclusively by lattice strain in pristine layered oxides without any electrochemical Li extraction under high voltage application. This work offers crucial insight toward the importance of strain relaxation to suppress oxygen loss for better cycling performance of layered oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release, and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading are critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#63743;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Toward Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction: Longstanding Debates and Emerging Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense debates, recent developments, and limitations of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are summarized,&#160;regarding the catalytic mechanism, evaluation criteria, and advanced electrocatalysts. Perspectives on the mechanisms study and electrocatalysts design are also proposed. This review will guide directions for boosting the understanding of catalytic mechanism and exploring efficient electrocatalysts for MOR.








Abstract
The study of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has lasted around 70 years, since the first investigation in the early 1950s. Though enormous effort has been devoted in this field, it is still far from commercialization. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), as a semi&#8208;reaction of DMFCs, is the bottleneck reaction that restricts the overall performance of DMFCs. To date, there has been&#160;intense debate on the complex six&#8208;electron reaction, but barely any reviews have systematically discussed this topic. To this end, the controversies and progress regarding the electrocatalytic mechanisms, performance evaluations as well as the design science toward MOR electrocatalysts are summarized. This review also provides a comprehensive introduction on the recent development of emerging MOR electrocatalysts with a focus on the innovation of the alloy, core&#8211;shell structure, heterostructure, and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Finally, perspectives on the future outlook toward study of the mechanisms and design of electrocatalysts are provided.

         <title>Metallic Glass&#8208;Fiber Fabrics: A New Type of Flexible, Super&#8208;Lightweight, and 3D Current Collector for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs) is a new type of super&#8208;lightweight, strong, flexible, electrochemically and thermally stable, and fire&#8208;resistant current collector. It displays great practical potential in the area of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible batteries. Replacing metal foils with MGFs can not only improve the energy density of lithium batteries by 9&#8211;18%, but also endow lithium batteries with outstanding flexible attributes.








Abstract
Current collectors are indispensable parts that provide electron transport and mechanical support of electrode materials in a battery. Nowadays, thin metal foils made of Cu and Al are used as current collectors of lithium batteries, but they do not contribute to the storage capacity. Therefore, decreasing the weight of current collectors can directly enhance the energy density of a battery. However, limited by the requirements of mechanical strength, it is difficult to reduce the weight of metal foils any further. Herein, a new type of current collectors made of 3D metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs), which shows advantages of super&#8208;lightweight (2.9&#8211;3.2&#160;mg cm&#8315;2), outstanding electrochemical stability for cathodes and anodes of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), fire resistance, high strength, and flexibility suitable for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll electrode fabrication is reported. The gravimetric energy densities of lithium batteries exhibit improvements of 9&#8211;18% by only replacing the metal foils with the MGFs. In addition, MGFs are suitable for the fabrication of flexible batteries. A high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium battery with an outstanding figure of merit of flexible battery (fbFOM) and flexing stability is demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering of Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential applications for atmospheric water harvesting are tantalizing. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of the most recent developments and challenges for developing practical sorption&#8208;based atmospheric&#8208;water harvesters. The sorbent design at the nanoscale, condensation enhancement at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale, and water scarcity assessments at the global scale are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Harvesting water from air in sorption&#8208;based devices is a promising solution to decentralized water production, aiming for providing potable water anywhere, anytime. This technology involves a series of coupled processes occurring at distinct length scales, ranging from nanometer to meter and even larger, including water sorption/desorption at the nanoscale, condensation at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale and water scarcity assessment at the global scale. Comprehensive understanding and bespoke designs at every scale are thus needed to improve the water&#8208;harvesting performance. For this purpose, a brief introduction of the global water crisis and its key characteristics is provided to clarify the impact potential and design criteria of water harvesters. Next the latest molecular&#8208;level optimizations of sorbents for efficient moisture capture and release are discussed. Then, novel microstructuring of surfaces to enhance dropwise condensation, which is favorable for atmospheric water generation, is shown. After that, system&#8208;level optimizations of sorbent&#8208;assisted water harvesters to achieve high&#8208;yield, energy&#8208;efficient, and low&#8208;cost water harvesting are highlighted. Finally, future directions toward practical sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting are outlined.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest achievements in the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalysis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are summarized. A brief introduction of the fundamentals and fabrication approaches of SACs and DACs is given, followed by highlighting the diverse applications of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal SACs and DACs in solar&#8208;driven artificial photosynthesis. The review ends with relevant opportunities, challenges, and perspectives.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis enables direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion aimed at mitigating environmental pollution and producing solar fuels and chemicals in a green and sustainable approach, and efficient, robust, and low&#8208;cost photocatalysts are the heart of artificial photosynthesis systems. As an emerging new class of cocatalytic materials, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have received a great deal of current attention due to their maximal atom utilization and unique photocatalytic properties, whereas noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free ones impart abundance, availability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness allowing for scalable implementation. This review outlines the fundamental principles and synthetic methods of SACs and DACs and summarizes the most recent advances in SACs (Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, Bi, Al, Sn, Er, La, Ba, etc.) and DACs (CuNi, FeCo, InCu, KNa, CoCo, CuCu, etc.) based on non&#8208;noble metals, confined on an arsenal of organic or inorganic substrates (polymeric carbon nitride, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, carbon, etc.) acting as versatile scaffolds in solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, methane conversion, organic synthesis, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and environmental remediation. The review concludes with the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free SACs and DACs for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Capsules Modulate Reactivity of Lead Iodide toward Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with UV Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8@formamidinium iodide multifunctional capsules induces porous channels within the lead iodide layer, facilitating the nucleation of perovskite nuclei and improving the light utilization through down&#8208;conversion effect. The utilization of this approach has resulted in a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.08%, along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability under UV and humid conditions.








Abstract
The two&#8208;step sequential deposition process is demonstrated as a reliable technology for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the complete conversion of dense PbI2 to perovskite in planar PVSCs is tough without mesoporous titanium dioxide as support. Herein, multifunctional capsules consisting of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) encapsulant and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and lead iodide (PbI2) layer. Intriguingly, the capsule dopant interlayer benefits the formation of porous PbI2 film due to the porous nanostructure of ZIF&#8208;8 that is favorable for the subsequent intercalation reaction. Furthermore, the constituent of the perovskite precursor in ZIF&#8208;8 pores can convert into the crystal nuclei of perovskite by reacting with PbI2 first, thereby promoting further perovskite crystallization. Significantly, the incorporation of ZIF&#8208;8 can enhance the resistance of perovskite against UV illumination due to down&#8208;conversion effect. Consequently, the modified device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.08% and displays enhanced UV stability, which can sustain 83% of its original PCE under 365&#160;nm UV illumination for 300&#160;h. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 90% of initial PCE after 1500&#160;h storage in dark ambient conditions with a relative humidity range of 50%&#8211;70%.

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Layered and Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anodes in Ester Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interface catalysis mechanism is developed to controllably design a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on hard carbon anodes in ester electrolytes by surface&#8208;reconstruction with abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds, which are active centers for preferentially catalyzing salt reduction. Due to such rationally regulated SEI, sodium&#8208;storage performance regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability is comprehensively enhanced.








Abstract
Constructing a homogenous and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium&#8208;storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium&#8208;storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g&#8722;1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high&#8208;performance HC anodes for sodium storage.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application.

The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self&#8208;powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.

         <title>Circadian Clock Regulation via Biomaterials for Nucleus Pulposus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus and improve disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8211;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid.








Abstract
Circadian clock disorder during tissue degeneration has been considered the potential pathogenesis for various chronic diseases, such as intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In this study, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials (ClockMPs) that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in IVDD and improve the physiological function of NPCs for disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8208;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid. In vitro experiments verified that ClockMPs can scavenge reactive oxygen species to maintain a stable microenvironment for the circadian clock by promoting the binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins. ClockMPs can regulate the expression of core circadian clock genes by activating the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway in NPCs to remodel the intrinsic circadian clock and promote extracellular matrix synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments of IVDD treated with ClockMPs proved that ClockMPs can promote disc regeneration by regulating the circadian clock of NPCs. In conclusion, ClockMPs provided a novel and promising strategy for circadian clock regulation during tissue regeneration.

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in&#8208;situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.S1 S2S3S4S5S6S7S8

&lt;p&gt;Snap-through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non-monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap-through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post-fabrication. Here, a class of topology-transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap-through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post-fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on-the-fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; adaptable sport&#160;equipment.&lt;a href="#adma202301109-supl-0001"&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are&#160;10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. We herein report the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT.&#160;By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor&#160;10B concentration of 8.8%ID/g or 102.1&#160;&#956;g/g at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response&#160;in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient&#160;10B accumulation.

         <title>The Construction of Microbial Synthesis System for Rare Earth Enrichment and Material Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rare earth materials play an irreplaceable role in biomedical and high technology fields. However, typical mining and extraction approaches of rare earth elements (REEs) often lead to severe environmental problems and resource wastage due to the involvement of hazardous chemicals. Although biomining showed elegant alternatives, there are still grand challenges to sustainably isolate and recover REEs in nature because of insufficient metal&#8208;extracting microbes and RE&#8208;scavenging macromolecular tools. To obtain high&#8208;performance rare earth materials directly from rare earth ore, new generation of biological synthesis strategies need to be developed for efficient preparation of REEs. The microbial synthesis system established here has achieved active biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth products. Further, through employing robust affinity columns bioconjugated with structurally engineered proteins, we acquired outstanding separation of Eu/Lu and Dy/La with purity of 99.9% (Eu), 97.1% (La) and 92.7% (Dy). More importantly, in situ one&#8208;pot synthesis of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase was well harnessed and exclusively adsorbed La, Ce, Pr, and Nd in RE tailing for advanced biocatalysis, indicating high value&#8208;added application. Therefore, our novel biosynthetic platform provides an insightful roadmap to expand the scope of chassis engineering in terms of biofoundry and to manufacture valuable bioproducts related to REEs.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency Enabled by a 2D&#8208;Conjugated Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor Featuring Favorable Electronic and Aggregation Structures</title>

Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy to design new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;16, the &#960;&#8208;expanded phenazine&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing Voc, Jsc, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based ternary devices fabricated via a two&#8208;in&#8208;one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.

         <title>Boosting the Photoluminescence Efficiency of InAs Nanocrystals Synthesized with Aminoarsine via a ZnSe Thick&#8208;shell Overgrowth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
InAs&#8208;based nanocrystals can enable RoHS&#8208;compliant optoelectronic devices, but their photoluminescence efficiency needs improvement for practical applications. We report an optimized synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals that allows to finely tune the ZnSe shell thickness up to 7 mono&#8208;layers (MLs) and to boost the emission, reaching a quantum yield of &#8764;70% at &#8764;900&#160;nm. We demonstrate that a high quantum yield can be attained when the shell thickness is at least &#8764;3ML. Notably, the photoluminescence lifetime (58&#160;ns) does not vary much as a function of the shell thickness, whereas the Auger recombination time (a limiting aspect in technological applications when fast) slows down from 11&#160;ps to 38&#160;ps when increasing the shell thickness from 1.5 to 7MLs. Chemical and structural analyses evidence that InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals do not exhibit any strain at the core&#8208;shell interface, likely due to the formation of an In&#8208;Zn&#8208;Se interlayer. Such interpretation is supported by atomistic modelling, which indicates the interlayer as being composed of In, Zn, Se and cation vacancies, alike to the In2ZnSe4 crystal structure. The simulations reveal an electronic structure consistent with that of type&#8208;I heterostructures, in which localized trap states can be passivated by a thick shell (&gt;3ML) and excitons are confined in the core.

         <title>Mechanistic computational modeling of implantable, bioresorbable, drug release systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable, bioresorbable drug delivery systems offer an alternative to current drug administration techniques; allowing for patient&#8208;tailored drug dosage, while also increasing patient compliance. Mechanistic mathematical modeling allows for the acceleration of the design of the release systems, and for prediction of physical anomalies that are not intuitive and might otherwise elude discovery. This study investigates short&#8208;term drug release as a function of water&#8208;mediated polymer phase inversion into a solid depot within hours to days, as well as long&#8208;term hydrolysis&#8208;mediated degradation and erosion of the implant over the next few weeks. Finite difference methods were used to model spatial and temporal changes in polymer phase inversion, solidification, and hydrolysis. Modeling revealed the impact of non&#8208;uniform drug distribution, production and transport of H+ ions, and localized polymer degradation on the diffusion of water, drug, and hydrolyzed polymer byproducts. Compared to experimental data, the computational model accurately predicted the drug release during the solidification of implants over days and drug release profiles over weeks from microspheres and implants. This work offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for release systems to meet a patient specific clinical need.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Stalactite Nanopores for Biosensing and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nature provides a wide range of self&#8208;assembled structures from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Under the right thermodynamic conditions and with the appropriate material supply, structures like stalactites, icicles, and corals can grow. However, the natural growth process is time&#8208;consuming. This work demonstrates a fast, nature&#8208;inspired method for growing stalactite nanopores using heterogeneous atomic deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. Our stalactite nanostructures combine the benefits of reduced sensing region typically for 2D material nanopores with the asymmetric geometry of capillaries, resulting in ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have been widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted in optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. We systematically analyze the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salts and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. We show that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. We exemplify the potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector based on Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This work provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering for developing high&#8208;performance Zn anodes and derived energy storage devices.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

         <title>Microfluidic Templated Stem Cell Spheroid Microneedles for&#160;Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic-engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Excimer&#8208;Mediated Ultrafast Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay Enables Giant Photothermal Performance for Optimized Phototheranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the competitive superiority of intermolecular nonradiative decay over the conventional intramolecular nonradiative decay in developing high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials. Rational manipulation of intermolecular nonradiative decay through simple aggregation control enables an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% to realize highly efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo.








Abstract
Developing organic photothermal materials (OPMs) with high photothermal performance for phototheranostic mainly focus on the manipulation of intramolecular nonradiative (intraNR) decay, which often requires quite complicated and time&#8208;consuming molecular engineering. In addition to intraNR decay, intermolecular nonradiative (interNR) decay is equally important and more convenient in governing photothermal performance. However, controlling interNR decay remains challenging due to the limited understanding of their origin and dynamics. Here, systemic investigation of intraNR and interNR decay directs the first demonstration of simple manipulation of interNR decay to produce a giant photothermal performance for optimized phototheranostic. Among three designed polymers with varying fluorine substitution, structure&#8211;performance studies reveal a dimer&#8208;initiated interNR decay to improve photothermal performance. Dimer is formed by intermolecular C&#63743;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bond. This finding inspires a simple aggregation control strategy to form excited dimer, namely, excimer. It initiates an &#8776;100&#8208;fold enhancement in interNR decay rate over conventional intraNR decay to produce ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% for efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo. This study provides insights into interNR decay in achieving a giant photothermal effect and paves a convenient way to develop high&#8208;performance OPMs.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h.

     alt="Li-Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li-ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron-delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion-diffusion barrier, the electron-rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion-transfer path, facilitating Li-ion migration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li-ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F-GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F-GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li-ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li/&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li solid-state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron-delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron-rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron-rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame-retardancy and makes F-GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, we introduce a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. We systematically investigate the impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 hours of storage.

         <title>Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Efficiency over Linear Assemblies of Copper&#8208;Cobalt Nanophases Stabilized by Redox Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a net&#8208;zero carbon route to the realization of high NH3 productivity. However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half&#8208;cell EE commonly &lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO3&#8722; binding affinity and sluggish NO3RR kinetics. To alleviate this, we suggest a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub&#8208;20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons. Our theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu&#8208;Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO3&#8722; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to NH3, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu&#8208;Co sites at sub&#8208;5&#160;nm distance. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative NO2. As a result, we achieve a stable NO3RR with a current density of &#8764;450&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% for the formation of NH3, and an unprecedented half&#8208;cell EE of &#8764;42%.

         <title>Evidence for anisotropic superconductivity beyond Pauli limit in infinite&#8208;layer lanthanum nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
After being expected as a promising analogue to cuprates for decades, superconductivity was&#160;recently discovered in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates, providing new opportunities to explore mechanisms of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. However, in sharp contrast to the single&#8208;band and anisotropic superconductivity in cuprates, nickelates exhibit a multi&#8208;band electronic structure and an unexpected isotropic superconductivity as reported recently, which challenges the cuprate&#8208;like picture in nickelates. Here, we show strong anisotropic magnetotransport behaviors in La&#8208;based nickelate films with enhanced crystallinity and superconductivity (Tconset$T_c^{onset}$ = 18.8 K, Tczero$T_c^{zero}$ = 16.5 K). The upper critical fields are anisotropic and violate the estimated BCS Pauli limit ( HPauli,&#956;=1&#956;B=1.86&#215;Tc,H=0${H}_{Pauli,\mu \ = \ 1{\mu }_B} = \ 1.86 \times {T}_{c,H\ = \ 0}$) for in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Moreover, the anisotropic superconductivity has been further manifested by the cusp&#8208;like peak of the angle&#8208;dependent Tc and the vortex motion anisotropy under external magnetic fields.

         <title>Surface Restructuring of Zeolite&#8208;Encapsulated Halide Perovskite to Activate Lattice Oxygen Oxidation for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites possess great potential for electrochemical water splitting that has not been realized due to their intolerance to water. Here, methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) are used to electrocatalyze water oxidation in aqueous electrolytes by creating MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 host&#8208;guest composites. Due to the protective feature of the zeolite matrix, halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolites achieve an excellent stability in water. The resultant electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the formation of an edge&#8208;sharing &#945;&#8208;PbO2 active layer. The existence of charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the MAPbX3/&#945;&#8208;PbO2 interface significantly modulates the surface electron density of the &#945;&#8208;PbO2 and optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate species. Furthermore, the soft&#8208;lattice nature of halide perovskites enables more facile triggering of lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of nanostructured &#945;&#8208;PbO2, exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent OER activity and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer for MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite. As a result, the developed MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite manifests an ultralow overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH. Our findings offer facile access to halide perovskite applied to water electrolysis with enhanced intrinsic activity, providing a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. Whilst liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to its biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, we summarize the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields. We start by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shift to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, we discuss the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices. We hope this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid&#8208;state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them has never been revealed. In this work, we develop a pyrazine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8208;acceptor effect. Notably, the intramolecular motions have almost been maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8208;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &#183;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging&#8208;guided cancer synergistic therapy. This work stimulates the development of advanced PS for the biomedical application and solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad potential for use in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites may be more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains were successfully designed and synthetized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT in a physiological environment. Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs were achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It was found that intracellular active substances (DNA and protein), not membranes, were more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enabled CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility, which was further proven in extended in vitro and in vivo aPDT experiments. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction was constructed for enhanced endogenous regeneration. Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, we prepared fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus(1&#8208;10Kpa) and ECM ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#956;g/ml), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling to direct cell fate. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#956;g/ml) could support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB was loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn and exhibited continuous release for over 28 days to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated ECM synthesis, thereby enhancing the endogenous regeneration of NP. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising novel strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Flexible Transparent Electrodes Formed from Template&#8208;Patterned Thin&#8208;Film Silver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We report template&#8208;patterned, flexible Transparent Electrodes (TEs) formed from an ultrathin silver film on top of a commercial optical adhesive &#8211; Norland Optical Adhesive 63 (NOA63). NOA63 is shown to be an effective base&#8208;layer for ultrathin silver films that advantageously prevents coalescence of vapour&#8208;deposited silver atoms into large, isolated islands (Volmer&#8208;Weber growth), and so aids the formation of ultrasmooth continuous films. 12&#8208;nm silver films on top of free&#8208;standing NOA63 combine high, haze&#8208;free visible&#8208;light transparency (T &#8776; 60% at 550&#160;nm) with low sheet&#8208;resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$ &#8776; 16 &#937;/sq.), and exhibit excellent resilience to bending, making them attractive candidates for flexible TEs. Etching the NOA63 base&#8208;layer with an oxygen plasma before silver deposition causes the silver to laterally segregate into isolated pillars, resulting in a much higher sheet resistance than silver grown on pristine NOA63 (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$&#160;&gt;&#160;8&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;&#937;/sq.). Hence, by selectively etching NOA63 before metal deposition, insulating regions may be defined within an otherwise conducting silver film, resulting in a differentially conductive film that can serve as a patterned TE for flexible devices. Transmittance may be increased (to 79% at 550&#160;nm) by depositing an antireflective layer of Al2O3 on the Ag layer at the cost of reduced flexibility.

         <title>Lubricated Interfaces Enabling Simultaneous Pulsatile and Continuous Chemical Release Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The release of chemicals following either pulsatile or continuous release modes is important for various potential applications, including programmed chemical reactions, mechanical actuation and treatments of various diseases. However, the simultaneous application of both modes in a single material system has been challenging. Here, we report two chemical loading methods in a liquid crystal&#8208;infused porous surface (LCIPS) which enables both a pulsatile and continuous release of chemicals simultaneously. Specifically, chemicals loaded in the porous substrate exhibit a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase&#8208;dependent continuous release, whereas the chemicals dissolved in micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets dispersed in the LC surface follow a pulsatile release activated by a phase transition. Moreover, we can control the loading method of distinct molecules to program their release mode. Finally, we demonstrate the pulsatile and continuous release of two distinct bioactive small molecules, tetracycline and dexamethasone, which display antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities for applications such as chronic wound healing and biomedical implant coating.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;bandwidth deep&#8208;red electroluminescence based on green plant&#8208;derived carbon dots</title>

Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, we report the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer. The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs displays high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics were rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endowed it with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibited catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroyed the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LaCoO3 nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

Photonic crystal fibre (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors.[1] Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibres by ex&#8208;situ transfer method, however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage.[2] Here, we&#160;report the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapour deposition method. A two&#8208;step growth method was&#160;developed to control the narrow diametre distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNTs embedded fibre, third&#8208;harmonic generation has been enhanced by &#8764;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. We&#160;further demonstrated a dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fibre mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8764;1561&#160;nm and &#8764;1064&#160;nm) by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diametre CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap PCF (HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8764; 0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8764; 1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fibre laser showed stable output of &#8764;10&#160;mW, &#8764;800 fs pulse width and &#8764;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. Our&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Magnetic Oxide&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si&#8208;based platforms, is challenging. Here we demonstrate van der Waals heterostructures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO), a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS2 on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force&#8208;mediated transfer were used to fabricate the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable rectifying behaviour, based on which metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MESFETs) with on&#8208;off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open&#8208;circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. Our work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure devices on Si&#8208;based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.

         <title>Tenascin&#8208;C activation of lung fibroblasts in a 3D synthetic lung extracellular matrix mimic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the structural integrity of the tissue and regulates the phenotype and functions of resident fibroblasts. Lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer alters these cell&#8208;ECM interactions, promoting fibroblast activation. There is a need for bio&#8208;instructive ECM models that contain the ECM composition and biomechanics of the lung to study these cell&#8208;matrix interactions in vitro. Here, we developed a synthetic, bioactive hydrogel that mimics the native lung modulus and includes a representative distribution of the most abundant ECM peptide motifs responsible for integrin binding and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;mediated degradation in the lung, which enables quiescent culture of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Stimulation with transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), metastatic breast cancer conditioned media (CM), or tenascin&#8208;C&#8208;derived integrin&#8208;binding peptide activated hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated HLFs, demonstrating multiple environmental methods to activate HLFs in a lung ECM mimicking hydrogel. We propose this lung hydrogel platform as a tunable, synthetic approach to studying the independent and combinatorial effects of ECM in regulating fibroblast quiescence and activation.

         <title>Multifunctional additive CdAc2 for efficient perovskite&#8208;based solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite films fabricated on flexible and textured substrates often are highly defective, leading to poor performance of perovskite devices. Finding substrate&#8208;tolerant perovskite fabrication strategies is therefore paramount. Herein, we show that adding a small amount of Cadmium Acetate (CdAc2) in the PbI2 precursor solution results in nano&#8208;hole array films and improves the diffusion of organic salts in PbI2, and promotes favorable crystal orientation and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Polycrystalline perovskite films on the flexible substrate with ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetimes exceeding 6 &#956;s are achieved. Eventually, a PCE of 22.78% is obtained for single&#8208;junction flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). Furthermore, we find the strategy is also applicable for textured tandem solar cells. A champion PCE of 29.25% (0.5003 cm2) was demonstrated for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) with CdAc2. Moreover, the un&#8208;encapsulated TSCs maintains 109.78% of its initial efficiency after 300 hours operational at 45&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere. Our work provides a facile strategy for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural earthworm with ability of loosening soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired a worldwide interests in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, we present a degradable actuator with ability of deforming in desired ways, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamideviaswelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamidein moisture conditions causes a rapid and remarkable bending. Such a mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques.The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting the rain diffusion as well as the root breath.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by charge&#8211;carrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0 cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8201;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

         <title>Formation Of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Calcium Phosphate With High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous iron&#8208;calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) plays a vital role in the mechanical properties of teeth of some rodents, which are very hard, but its formation process and synthetic route remain unknown. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of an iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of ammonium iron citrate (AIC). The iron is distributed homogeneously on the nanometer scale in the resulting particles. The prepared Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in aqueous media, including water, simulated body fluid and acetate buffer solution (pH 4). In vitro study demonstrates that these particles have good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. Subsequently, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is utilized to consolidate the initial Fe&#8208;ACP powders. The results show that the hardness of the ceramics increases with the increase of iron content, but an excess of iron leads to a rapid decline in hardness. Calcium iron phosphate ceramics with a hardness of 4 GPa can be achieved, which is higher than that of human enamel. Furthermore, the ceramics composed of iron&#8208;calcium phosphates showed enhanced acid resistance. This study provides a novel route to prepare Fe&#8208;ACP, and presents the potential role of Fe&#8208;ACP in biomineralization and as starting material to fabricate acid&#8208;resistant high&#8208;performance bioceramics.

         <title>Surface Optics and Color Effects of Liquid Metal Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are a kind of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alloys, usually appearing silvery&#8208;white. Colorful liquid metals can be prepared by different strategies, including the coating and compounding, physical vapor deposition/chemical vapor deposition, structural color, external stimuli, and fluorescence functionalization. The color and fluorescence functionalization of liquid metals have broken through the limitations of the conventional single&#8208;color physical appearance, and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) are emerging as new functional materials with rather unique physical or chemical behaviors. They are generally safe and nontoxic, have high boiling points, reflectivities, good thermal and electrical conductivities, flexibility, fluidity, self&#8208;healing capability and remain in liquid state at room temperature. However, the further applications of LMs are limited by their single&#8208;color physical appearance, such as working in the situations with imposed stringent requirements for color and aesthetics. Recently, the color and fluorescence functionalization of LMs have overcome many conventional technical bottlenecks and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure. In this review, the recent developments in the optical properties, color and fluorescence effects of LMs are comprehensively investigated. The synthesis, structures, properties, chromogenic mechanisms, and potential photoelectric applications of colorful LMs are systematically analyzed and compared. The effectiveness and characteristics of colorful LMs induced by coating, mixing, compounding, surface modification, external stimuli are provided, aiming to establish a potential system for the synthesis and practices of colorful LMs. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field have also been identified and explained to preferably guide further scientific and technical research in the coming time.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;generation Communications</title>

Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

         <title>Multifunctionality Through Embedding Patterned Nanostructures in High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite being one of the pillars of high&#8208;performance materials in the industry, manufacturing carbon fiber composites with concurrent maximized multifunctionality and structural properties has remained elusive primarily due to the lack of practical bottom&#8208;up approaches with control over nanoscale interactions. Herein, a programmable spray coating is introduced for the controlled deposition of multiple nanomaterials with tailorable patterns in composites. Guided by the droplet's internal currents, amphiphilicity of the building hybrid nanoparticles deposited on the interfacial region of the composite grants control over the specific surface area and bonding energy values at the atomic scale that results in disk or ring patterns. Controlling these patterns regulate the formation of interfaces, crack containment and damage, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity, which is lacking in conventional manufacturing with the random inclusion of nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations show that increasing the share of cellulose nanocrystals in the hybrid nanomaterials, which is synchronous with shifting patterns from disk to ring, enhances the cohesion of the epoxy phase and improves the effective interactions between the two phases of carbon and in the interfacial region manifested in higher interlaminar and flexural strength. Transitioning from ring to disk creates a larger connected network manifested in higher thermal and electrical properties with no penalty on mechanical performance. This novel approach introduces a new bottom&#8208;up design paradigm, in which the mechanical and multifunctional performance is solely dependent on the shape of the deposited patterns in composites and thus eliminates the tradeoff between properties that are considered paradoxical in today's manufacturing of hierarchical composites

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties, but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) was evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS was modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptor. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function and strong ROS elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties, but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) was evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS was modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion-specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptor. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function and strong ROS elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non-invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first-line drug 5-aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strong Tough Thermogalvanic Hydrogel Thermocell With Extraordinarily High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermocells can continuously convert heat into electricity, and they are widely used to power wearable electronic devices. However, they have a risk of leakage and poor mechanical properties. Although quasi&#8208;solid ionic thermocells can overcome the issue of electrolyte leakage, the trade&#8208;off between their excellent mechanical properties and high thermopower remains a major challenge. In this study, we combine stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and the thermoelectric effect to propose a high&#8208;strength quasi&#8208;solid stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) with a large tensile strength of 19&#160;MPa and high thermopower of 6.5&#160;mV K&#8722;1. The SPTC exhibits a high stretchability of 1300%, ultrahigh toughness of 163.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and high specific output power density of 1969 &#956;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2. These comprehensive properties are superior to those of previously reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic thermocells. We demonstrate the use of SPTC&#8208;based systems in wearable devices for energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring. This can facilitate the rapid implementation of sustainable wearable electronics in the Internet of Things era.

Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered cascade amplification of nanotherapies has attracted considerable attention as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. With the remarkable advances in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, a large number of well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated to trigger therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ferroptosis. under exogenous US stimulation or specific substances generated by US actuation, to maximize antitumor efficacy and minimize detrimental effects. Therefore, summarizing the corresponding nanotherapies and applications based on US&#8208;triggered cascade amplification is essential. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the recent advances in the design of intelligent modalities, consisting of unique components, distinctive properties, and specific cascade processes. These ingenious strategies confer unparalleled potential to nanotherapies based on ultrasound&#8208;triggered cascade amplification and provide superior controllability, thus overcoming the unmet requirements of precision medicine and personalized treatment. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of this emerging strategy and expect to encourage more innovative ideas and promote their further development.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels with DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, we introduce a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry. Rapid hydrogel photo&#8208;patterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8764;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Finally, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8208;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron&#8208;resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Engineering of Defective MOF&#8208;801 Nanostructures within Macroporous Spheres for Highly Efficient and Stable Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water harvesting using the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;801 is restricted by limited working capacity, powder structuring, and finite stability. To overcome these issues, we&#160;crystallized MOF&#8208;801 on the surface of macroporous poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres, called P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA), through an in situ confined growth strategy, forming spherical MOF&#8208;801@P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA) composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. By lowering the nucleation energy barrier, the average size of the MOF&#8208;801 crystals decreased by 20 times. Thus, abundant defects as adsorption sites for water could&#160;be installed in the crystals lattices. As a consequence, the composite provides an unprecedented high water harvesting efficiency. The composite was&#160;produced in the kilogram&#8208;scale and can capture 1.60&#160;kg H2O/kg composite/day from 20% RH between 25&#176;C and 85&#176;C. This work provides an effective methodology for improving the adsorption capacity through controlled defects formation as adsorption sites and to improve the kinetics through the design of a composite with macroporous transport channel network.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, we&#160;propose an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimized the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V was&#160;obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrated high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10 &#215; 10 cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties have always been a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, w e have proposed a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane (PU&#8208;TA@MXene) film with a bionic Janus architecture, which wa s prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor wa s endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties and application platforms of flexible sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties have always been a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, w e have proposed a novel tannic acid (TA)-modified MXene-polyurethane (PU-TA@MXene) film with a bionic Janus architecture, which wa s prepared by gravity-driven self-assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self-healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure and stretching.
