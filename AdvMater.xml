         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Photoelectric Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystals enables a low surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#181;m2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Meanwhile, polar (111) surface engineering induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, which may be beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions.








Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubic/tetrahedral single&#8208;crystals are reported with precise control of the (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining&#160;with theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of the CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#181;m2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier&#8208;transport capability. Meanwhile, the polar (111) surface induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8208;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8211;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning toward N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu (Fe, Co, Ni) atoms. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs favor better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation, and can work as reactive sites to tune the non&#8208;covalent interactions of the intermediates, optimize the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N, and alter the hydrogenation pathways.








Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu atoms. The local polarization can be created along the Cu&#63743;O&#63743;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3&#215; and 88.2&#215; improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate reaching 291.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between the catalyst's surface and N2 molecules, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from the associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tuning the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands toward Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability constant (K) of ligand, which reflects its interaction with Zn ions, is proposed to ean ideal parameter to decode how the solvation chemistry intrinsically regulates the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential of a stable Zn anode, toward long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. This study proposes the use of&#160;a stability constant (K), namely, the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic gel is developed for atmospheric water harvesting in arid climates by integrating a hygroscopic salt, LiCl, with a cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymeric network, polyacrylamide. The interactions between the polymer network and the captured water increase the free/weakly bonded water content compared with pure salt sorbent, lowering the desorption heat to achieve a high water yield of &#8776;7&#160;g g&#8722;1 per day in a 20% relative humidity environment.








Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from the ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake by&#160;salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in arid environments. However, they often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. A &#160;LiCl&#8208;incorporating polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAM&#8211;LiCl)&#160;capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments is proposed. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water generate more free and weakly bonded water, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy-efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable crystallization is particularly significant for tin perovskites because their fast crystallization rate usually causes high trap density and low photoluminescence quantum efficiency, thus resulting in low light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) efficiencies. In this work, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating technique is developed to retard crystallization and improve the external quantum efficiency of tin perovskite LEDs up to 5.3%.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are a promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high&#8208;quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating method is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality tin perovskites and high&#8208;efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film&#8208;formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8776;30%, which is an approximately fourfold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;ion batteries are a typical electrochemical system controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The recent progress on the investigation of battery dynamics at various scales is reviewed, via newly developed visualization techniques that provide powerful tools to make the &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; into a &#8220;see&#8208;through&#8221; battery.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries, the most&#8208;popular secondary battery, are typically electrochemical systems controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The battery dynamics involve mass transport, charge transfer, ion&#8211;electron coupled reactions, electrolyte penetration, ion solvation, and interfacial evolution. However, it is difficult for the traditional electrochemical methods to capture the accurate and individual details of the dynamic processes in &#8220;black box&#8221; batteries; instead, only the net result of multi&#8208;factors on the whole scale. Recently, different advanced visualization techniques have been developed, which provide powerful tools to track and monitor the internal real&#8208;time dynamic processes, giving intuitive details and fine information at various scales from crystal lattice, single particle, electrode to cell level. Here, the recent progress on the investigation of electrochemical dynamics in battery materials are reviewed, via developed techniques across wide timescales and space&#8208;scales, including the dynamic process inside the active particle, kinetics issues at the electrode/electrolyte interface, dynamic inhomogeneity in the electrode, and dynamic transportation at the cell level. Finally, the fundamental principles to improve the battery dynamics are summarized and new technologies for future more stringent conditions are highlighted. In prospect, this review opens sight on the battery interior for a clearer, deeper, and more thorough understanding of the dynamics.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Growth of B5&#8208;Site&#8208;Rich Ru Nanoparticles Guided by Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active Ru catalyst with abundant active sites for ammonia dehydrogenation, which is essential for utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, is prepared by a novel synthesis method. A highly active Ru catalyst with a unique atomic structure is designed to induce the formation of hexagonal planar&#8208;shaped Ru nanoparticles with abundant B5 sites by utilizing 2D hexagonal boron nitride as a template support.








Abstract
Ruthenium is one of the most active catalysts for ammonia dehydrogenation and is essential for the use of ammonia as a hydrogen storage material. The B5&#8208;type site on the surface of ruthenium is expected to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation, but the number of these sites is typically low. Here, a B5&#8208;site&#8208;rich ruthenium catalyst is synthesized by exploiting the crystal symmetry of a hexagonal boron nitride support. In the prepared ruthenium catalyst, ruthenium nanoparticles are formed epitaxially on hexagonal boron nitride sheets with hexagonal planar morphologies, in which the B5 sites predominate along the nanoparticle edges. By activating the catalyst under the reaction condition, the population of B5 sites further increases as the facets of the ruthenium nanoparticles develop. The electron density of the Ru nanoparticles also increases during catalyst activation. The synthesized catalyst shows superior catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation compared to previously reported catalysts. This work demonstrates that morphology control of a catalyst via support&#8208;driven heteroepitaxy can be exploited for synthesizing highly active heterogeneous catalysts with tailored atomic structures.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe non&#8208;radiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, we developed a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs. The heterostructure was contrived through the van der Waal integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type I heterojunction with 3D FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% was achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13&#160;V to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets could effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retained &#8764;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 hours, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, we exploit the conversion reaction of metal fluorides because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identified silver fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full&#8208;cells attain reliable cycling at 25&#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8208;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 = 50&#160;mg cm&#8210;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode-less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode-less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, we exploit the conversion reaction of metal fluorides because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identified silver fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid-solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF-based full-cells attain reliable cycling at 25&#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (areal loading of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 50&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode-less electrodes for sulfide-based ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electro&#8208;conductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long&#8208;term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, we report a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8208;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long&#8208;term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor&#8208;made 2 Ah Li&#8208;S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is realized. This work opens up new opportunities for liquid phase binary alloys as electrocatalysts for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Edge&#8208;site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8208;N4 nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extensive efforts have been devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8208;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#8208;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a new type of an atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, where each ultra&#8208;small cell (&#8764; 2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of ultraviolet (UV) pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8208;lattice interactions, along with the gate&#8208;tunability, leading to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, we show that such device scheme can generally be realized in other two&#8208;dimensional vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2 and WSe2. Demonstration of our atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultra&#8208;high integration density.

         <title>Approaching The External Quantum Efficiency Limit in two&#8208;Dimensional Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenge in exceeding 50% and 3% due to the low efficiency of photo&#8208;carrier separation and collection. Here, we demonstrate photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals (vdW) metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photo&#8208;carrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photo&#8208;carrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly&#8208;ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the S&#8208;Q limit.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium Ion Micro&#8208;batteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable sodium ion micro&#8208;batteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate, hold promises for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allowed the multi&#8208;layer printing of NIMB electrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8764;1200&#160;&#956;m while maintaining effective ion and electron transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8211;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed micro&#8208;batteries. The NIMBs showed enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes despite the large thickness exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

Consequently, the 3D-printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming the state-of-the-art printed micro-batteries. The NIMBs showed enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 40&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; and robust long-term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes despite the large thickness exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for construction of high-performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Over the last few decades, the research on ferroelectric memories has been limited due to their dimensional scalability and incompatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, with inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub&#8208;30&#160;nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device&#8208;to&#8208;device&#8208;variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, ferroelectric field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing&#8208;in&#8208;memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on the ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to the future prospects.

         <title>Eliminating Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrode for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) is promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+ storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers led to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, we&#160; report new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) by effectively eliminating micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevate the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160; characterizations together with in situ&#160; electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements manifest that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with ultralong lifespan up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge storge mechanism and advanced electrode materials design for ZICs toward practical applications.

         <title>Balanced interfacial ion concentration and migration steric hindrance promoting high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution battery chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of many electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency of this reaction remain a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ ion concentration and Mn2+ ion migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8208;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, formate anion also provides high adsorption density on cathode surface due to the small spatial hindrance, which can shield the electrostatic repulsion during the process of Mn2+ migration at the interface. Particularly for the desolvation of interfacial Mn2+ ions, the formate anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in the lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility for MnO2/Mn2+ deposition/dissolution chemistry. The in&#8208;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieved a good balance between ion concentration and ion migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W h kg&#8211;1 and long cycle life of more than 300 cycles without obvious decay. This work points out a promising way for the interface design of practical energy storage system based on solid&#8208;liquid interfacial transition reaction with high energy density.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic&#8208;Ferromagnetic Heterostructure&#8208;based Field&#8208;Free Terahertz Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Recently, ferromagnetic heterostructure spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation THz sources, owing to their peculiarities of high efficiency, high stability, low cost, ultrabroad bandwidth, controllable polarization, and high scalability. Despite the substantial efforts, they rely on external magnetic fields to initiate the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, which hitherto greatly limits its proliferation as practical devices. Here, we innovate a unique antiferromagnetic&#8208;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|CoFeB) heterostructure and demonstrate that it can efficiently generate THz radiation without any external magnetic field. We assign it to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect and enhanced anisotropy. By precisely balancing the exchange bias effect and the enhanced THz radiation efficiency, an optimized 5.6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick IrMn3|CoFeB|W tri&#8208;layer heterostructure is successfully realized, yielding an intensity surpassing that of Pt|CoFeB|W. Moreover, the intensity of THz emission is further boosted by togethering the tri&#8208;layer sample and bi&#8208;layer sample Besides, the THz polarization may be flexibly controlled by rotating the sample azimuthal angle, manifesting sophisticated active THz field manipulation capability. The field&#8208;free coherent THz emission we demonstrate here shines light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Technological breakthroughs in chip fabrication, transfer, and color conversion for high performance micro&#8208;LED display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The implementation of high efficiency and high&#8208;resolution displays has been the focus of considerable research interest. Recently, micro&#8208;LEDs, which are inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes of size less than 100 &#956;m2, have emerged as a promising display technology owing to their superior features and advantages over other displays like liquid crystal displays and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Although many companies have introduced micro&#8208;LED displays since 2012, obstacles to mass production still exist. Three major challenges, i.e., low quantum efficiency, time consuming transfer, and complex color conversion, have been overcome with technological breakthroughs to realize cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;LED displays. In the review, methods for improving the degraded quantum efficiency of GaN based micro&#8208;LEDs induced by the size effect are examined, including wet chemical treatment, passivation layer adoption, LED structure design, and growing LEDs in self&#8208;passivated structures. Novel transfer technologies, including pick&#8208;up transfer and self&#8208;assembly methods, for developing large&#8208;area micro&#8208;LED displays with high yield and reliability are discussed in depth. Quantum dots as color conversion materials for high color purity, and deposition methods such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing or contact printing on micro&#8208;LEDs have also been addressed. This review presents current status and critical challenges of micro&#8208;LED technology and promising technical breakthroughs for commercialization of high performance displays.

Novel transfer technologies, including pick-up transfer and self-assembly methods, for developing large-area micro-LED displays with high yield and reliability are discussed in depth. Quantum dots as color conversion materials for high color purity, and deposition methods such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing or contact printing on micro-LEDs have also been addressed. This review presents current status and critical challenges of micro-LED technology and promising technical breakthroughs for commercialization of high performance displays.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists including 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Recent Progress in Strain Engineering on Van der Waals 2D Materials: Tunable Electrical, Electrochemical, Magnetic and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. We summarize some novel methods to induce strain and then highlight the tunable electrical, and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering including particularly the previously less discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, the future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. It provides suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Active Materials and Devices for Bio&#8208;Interfaced Pressure Sensors &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pressures generated by external forces or by internal body processes represent parameters of critical importance in diagnosing physiological health and in anticipating injuries. Examples span intracranial hypertension from traumatic brain injuries, high blood pressure from poor diet, pressure&#8208;induced skin ulcers from immobility, and edema from congestive heart failure. Pressures measured on the soft surfaces of vital organs or within internal cavities of the body can provide essential insights into patient status and progression. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance pressure sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable safe monitoring for extended periods of time. This review focuses on recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs for classes of soft pressure sensors that have some proven uses in these contexts. The discussions include applications of such sensors as implantable and wearable systems, with various unique capabilities in wireless continuous monitoring, minimally invasive deployment, natural degradation in biofluids and/or multiplexed spatiotemporal mapping. A concluding section summarizes challenges and future opportunities for this growing field of materials and biomedical research.

         <title>Reversible phase transition for durable formamidinium&#8208;dominated perovskite photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase instability (especially phase transition) is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transition kinetics is urgently needed to explore more effective phase stabilization strategies. Herein for the first time, we monitored the reversible phase transition process of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of the degraded devices. Moreover, through in&#8208;situ atomic force microscope (AFM) characterization, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase was revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to analyze the thermodynamic origin of phase transition, where the driving force for &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; transition was associated with configurational enthalpy, while the &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; transition was dominated by the temperature&#8208;related vibrational entropy. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 could be finally stabilized at elevated temperature (e.g., 60&#176;C) under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after aging at 60&#176;C and 60% relative humidity (RH) for 1000 hours. Our finding provided a deepened understanding on the phase transition process of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presented an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

         <title>Filler&#8208;Integrated Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) utilizing fillers as the promoting component bridge the gap between solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. The integration of fillers into the polymer matrices has been demonstrated as a prevailing strategy to enhance Li&#8208;ion transport and assist in constructing Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer, which addresses the two key barriers of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs): low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and high interfacial impedance. Recent review articles have largely focused on the performance of a broad spectrum of CPEs and the general effects of fillers on SSLBs device. Recognizing this, in this review, after briefly presenting the categories of fillers (traditional and emerged) and the promoted ionic conducting mechanisms in CPEs, we seek to assess the progress in the interfacial structure design principle, with the emphasis on the crucial influence of filler size, concentration and hybridization strategies on filler&#8208;polymer interface that is the most critical to Li&#8208;ion transport. The latest exciting advances on filler&#8208;enabled in&#8208;situ generation of a Li+&#8208;conductive layer at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to greatly reduce the interfacial impedance are further elaborated. Finally, we discuss the challenges to be addressed, outline research directions and provide a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles in Biosystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic protein&#8208;mimicking properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential in biological and biomedical applications. Representative categories of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that act as mimics of enzymes, mimics of fluorescent proteins, interacting partners of specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds in biosystems are summarized.








Abstract
Proteins are essential elements for almost all life activities. The emergence of nanotechnology offers innovative strategies to create a diversity of nanoparticles (NPs) with intrinsic capacities of mimicking the functions of proteins. These artificial mimics are produced in a cost&#8208;efficient and controllable manner, with their protein&#8208;mimicking performances comparable or superior to those of natural proteins. Moreover, they can be endowed with additional functionalities that are absent in natural proteins, such as cargo loading, active targeting, membrane penetrating, and multistimuli responding. Therefore, protein&#8208;mimicking NPs have been utilized more and more often in biosystems for a wide range of applications including detection, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. To highlight recent progress in this broad field, herein, representative protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that fall into one of the four distinct categories are summarized: mimics of enzymes (nanozymes), mimics of fluorescent proteins, NPs with high affinity binding to specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds. This review covers their subclassifications, characteristic features, functioning mechanisms, as well as the extensive exploitation of their great potential for biological and biomedical purposes. Finally, the challenges and prospects in future development of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs are discussed.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles as a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) that activate antitumor innate immunity are reported. DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. The system effectively primes cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extends the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice by 32 days.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) is engineered for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Integration Design of Sn&#8208;ZnO Catalyst Towards Efficient and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is a potential sustainable strategy for alleviating CO2 emissions and producing valuable fuels. In the quest to resolve its current problems of low energy efficiency and insufficient durability, we propose a dual&#8208;scale design strategy by implanting non&#8208;noble active Sn&#8208;ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres (Sn&#8208;ZnO@HC). The metal d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate&#8208;molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the break of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn&#8208;ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore scale control, Sn&#8208;ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of &#8208;0.53&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and ultralong stability of 240 hours. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.

In the quest to resolve its current problems of low energy efficiency and insufficient durability, we propose a dual-scale design strategy by implanting non-noble active Sn-ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high-surface-area carbon nanospheres (Sn-ZnO@HC). The metal d-bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate-molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the break of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn-ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore scale control, Sn-ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of -0.53&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and ultralong stability of 240 hours. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8211;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP2 nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP2/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP2 shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP2/C toward high&#8208;efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes; however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, it is reported that a homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8211;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8211;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Intrinsic Defects in Porous Carbons for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of intrinsic carbon defects is usually tangled with doping effects, and the identification of their unique roles in catalysis remains a tough task. Herein, a K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C) with abundant intrinsic defects and complete elimination of heteroatom via direct pyrolysis of K+&#8208;confined metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurement and scanning transmission electron microscopy jointly illustrate the existence of abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type carbon defects (V12) in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C. Remarkably, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C achieves ultrahigh CO Faradaic efficiency (99%) at &#8208;0.45&#160;V in CO2 electroreduction, far surpassing MOF&#8208;derived carbon without K+ etching. Theoretical calculations reveal that the V12 defects in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C favor the CO2 adsorption and significantly accelerate the formation of rate&#8208;determining COOH* intermediate, thereby promoting CO2 reduction. This work develops a novel strategy to generate intrinsic carbon defects and provides new insights into their critical role in catalysis.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensors: Toward New Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The sensing performances of gas sensors must be improved and diversified to enhance the quality of life by ensuring health, safety, and convenience. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit an extremely high surface area, abundant porosity, and unique surface chemistry, provide a promising framework for facilitating gas sensor innovations. Enhanced understanding of conduction mechanisms of MOFs has facilitated their use as gas sensing materials, and various types of MOFs have been developed by examining the compositional and morphological dependences and implementing catalyst incorporation and light activation. Owing to their inherent separation and absorption properties and catalytic activity, MOFs have been applied as molecular sieves, absorptive filtering layers, and heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, oxide&#8208; or carbon&#8208;based sensing materials with complex structures or catalytic composites can be derived by the appropriate post&#8208;treatment of MOFs. This review discusses the effective techniques to design optimal MOFs, in terms of computational screening and synthesis methods. Moreover, the mechanisms through which the distinctive functionalities of MOFs as sensing materials, heterostructures, and derivatives can be incorporated in gas sensor applications are presented.

         <title>Controllable Heterogenous Seeding&#8208;Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization is introduced to assist perovskite growth. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is introduced into the precursor to form a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2, which serve as seed to induce perovskite crystallization during solvent evaporation. The hetero&#8208;SiC process is a proven effective way to manipulate the nucleation process and crystal growth, visualized by several in situ measurement tools.








Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study is conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, a new strategy&#8212;&#8220;heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite&#160;is proposed. In this work, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is directly introduced into the precursor, which forms a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2. The low&#8208;solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of the perovskite during the solvent&#8208;evaporation process. Various in situ measurement&#160;tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which is shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. The hetero&#8208;SiC process greatly improves the film quality, reduces film defects, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. A hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability under light illumination is enhanced and the PSC retains 84% of its initial performance after 1400 h of light illumination.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting phenomenon in that Te nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;a&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size of Te NWs and their layers is also discussed.








Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in the reported literature. Herein, an unusual but interesting phenomenon, in&#160;that tellurium nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs is also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction system. Hot&#8208;electron injection at the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction interface induces a more obvious tendency to behave with a negative photoresponse. These findings will be beneficial for potential applications of Te&#8208;NW&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Microstructured BN composites with internally designed high thermal conductivity paths for 3D electronic packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Miniaturized and high&#8208;power density 3D electronic devices pose new challenges on thermal management. Indeed, prompt heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging is currently limited by the thermal conductivity achieved by thermal interface materials (TIMs) and by their capability to direct the heat towards heat sinks. Here, we create high thermal conductivity BN&#8208;based composites able to conduct heat intentionally towards specific areas by locally orienting magnetically functionalized BN microplatelets using magnetically assisted slip casting (MASC). The obtained thermal conductivity along the direction of alignment is unusually high, up to 12.1&#160;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 thanks to a high concentration of 62.6 vol% of BN in the composite, a low concentration in polymeric binder and a high degree of alignment. The BN composites have a low density of 1.3&#160;g cm&#8211;3, a high stiffness of 442.3&#160;MPa and are electrically insulating. Uniquely, we demonstrate our approach with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept composites having locally graded orientations of BN microplatelets to direct the heat away from two vertically stacked heat sources. Rationally designing the microstructure of TIMs to direct heat strategically provides a promising solution for efficient thermal management in 3D integrated electronics.

         <title>Enhanced Photoconductivity at Dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocations can boost the photoconductivity in oxide semiconductors. Well&#8208;ordered, high&#8208;density dislocation arrays dedicatedly produced in Fe&#8208;doped SrTiO3 single crystals show manyfold increased photoconductivity in the regions around dislocation compared to the dislocation free regions of the sample.








Abstract
Dislocations are 1D crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme pool boiling performance is achieved by manipulating liquid&#8211;vapor transport at three length scales by engineering surface structures: 1) at millimeter scale, bubble coalescence is minimized and the complete capillary wicking is exploited with separated nucleation sites, 2) at micrometer scale, microcavities promote vapor nucleation, and 3) at nanometer scale, nanostructures extend the liquid&#8211;vapor interface for enhanced evaporation.








Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy&#8208;transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them&#8212;HTC enhancement requires high nucleation&#8208;site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, this trade&#8208;off is overcome by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. The bubble coalescence is minimized to enhance the CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation&#8208;site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. The hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Azotetrazolate Energetic Materials Plus Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production Using Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling system for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production and green electrosynthesis of energetic materials (EMs) is developed. The coupling system displays an ultralow cell voltage of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing a reduction of 410&#160;mV relative to overall water splitting. This strategy solves the problems of high&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption hydrogen production and the hazardous traditional synthesis conditions of EMs.








Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, that is, oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish OER is a significant limiting step that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

         <title>Structure and Evolution of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Hybrid Electrolytes Formed Inside Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries created by in situ polymerization of a liquid monomer provide a path toward practical electrochemical cells in flexible form factors. In this work, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes formed inside a battery cell using ring&#8208;opening polymerization of DOL&#8208;nanoparticle suspensions are reported. The electrolytes are evaluated in battery cells utilizing both intercalation and conversion cathodes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) formed inside an electrochemical cell by polymerization of a liquid precursor provide a promising strategy for overcoming problems with electrolyte wetting in solid&#8208;state batteries. Hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (HSPEs) created by in situ polymerization of a conventional liquid precursor containing electrochemically inert nanostructures are of particular interest because they offer a mechanism for selectively reinforcing or adding&#160;new&#160;functionalities&#160;to the electrolyte&#8212;removing the need for high degrees of polymerization. The synthesis, structure, chemical kinetics,&#160;ion&#8208;transport&#160;properties&#160;and electrochemical characteristics of HSPEs created by Al(OTf)3&#8208;initiated polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) containing hairy, nano&#8208;sized SiO2&#160;particles are reported. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the particles are well&#8208;dispersed in&#160;liquid&#160;DOL. Strong interaction between poly(ethylene glycol) molecules tethered to the SiO2&#160;particles and poly(DOL) lead to co&#8208;crystallization&#8212;anchoring the nanoparticles in their host It also enables polymerization&#8211;depolymerization processes in DOL to be studied and controlled. The utility of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed HSPE, is demonstrated first in Li|HSPE|Cu half cells, which manifest Coulombic efficiencies (CE) values approaching 99%. HSPEs are also demonstrated in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite full&#8208;cell batteries. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path toward all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Magneto&#8211;Electric&#8211;Optical Coupling in Multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;Based Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling is realized in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based films at room temperature by engineering ferroelastic switching. The reversible ferroelastic switching is ubiquitous in BiFeO3&#8208;based films with flexible strain states and domain patterns, which is determined by the photoinduced electric field and symmetry mismatch in films. This work provides a framework for multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric memories with low power consumption.








Abstract
Manipulating ferroic orders and realizing their coupling in multiferroics at room temperature are promising for designing future multifunctional devices. Single external stimulation has been extensively proved to demonstrate the ability of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic oxides, which is crucial to bridge the ferroelectricity and magnetism. However, it is still challenging to directly realize multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic oxides as potential multifunctional electrical devices. Here, novel magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based thin films at room temperature mediated by deterministic ferroelastic switching using piezoresponse/magnetic force microscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are shown. Reversible photoinduced ferroelastic switching exhibiting magnetoelectric responses is confirmed in BiFeO3&#8208;based films, which works at flexible strain states. This work directly demonstrates room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic films, which provides a framework for designing potential multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric devices such as energy conservation memories.

         <title>Not All Aggregates Are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology, and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
The solution aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are largely tuned by varying the solvent selectivity toward the backbone versus side chains. This results in three distinct assembly pathways and thin&#8208;film morphologies. Surprisingly, amorphous network aggregates outcompete semicrystalline ones to give rise to highly ordered and aligned morphology and enhanced charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge&#8208;transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are modulated by tuning selectivity of the solvent toward the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain&#8208;associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, and random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in the solid state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by the dichroic ratio is enhanced by up to 14&#8208;fold, and the charge&#8208;carrier mobility increases by a maximum of 20&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, the assembly pathways and the resulting thin&#8208;film morphology and device properties can be drastically tuned.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological thermal metamaterials are presented. An accurate theoretical framework is established to study the geometric phase and dynamics of the thermal lattices. The topological properties of diffusive systems and localized heat diffusion protected by the topological edge states are revealed. The work can be applied to facilitate the heat dissipation of hot spots.








Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, the above challenges are overcome and systematic studies are performed on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, the band structure and geometric phase are analytically obtained without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. The topological edge state is experimentally demonstrated as localized heat diffusion and its dependence on the boundary conditions is verified. This approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics toward Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is designed to protect the Zn anode from &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The protective layer not only promotes Zn2+ desolvation and transport but also regulates Zn2+ concentration gradient and electric field to guarantee uniform Zn deposition. With this novel semi&#8208;immobilized coating technique, highly stable zinc batteries are fabricated and can be operated over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated as a next&#8208;generation energy storage system due to their high safety and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of ZIBs. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode over a wide temperature range from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition; the free anions of the ILs can weaken the hydrogen bonds of the water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion&#8208;transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries is greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800&#160;h at 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000&#160;h under a wide temperature window from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy is well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80&#8201;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Nonvolatile Control of Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition in VO2 by Ferroelectric Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior in a vanadium dioxide is demonstrated by employing the heteroepitaxial Mott transistor. Due to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectricity is successfully proven by showing a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible memory performance.








Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, an approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior is developed by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT can be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#181;C cm&#8722;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8776;102), long retention time (&#8776;104 s), and high endurance (&#8776;103 cycles). Furthermore, the structural phase transition of VO2 is corroborated by ferroelectric polarization through in situ Raman mapping analysis. This study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

         <title>2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTT)2 Films for Broadband Photodetectors from Ultraviolet to Mid&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>

Wafer&#8208;scale 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) thin films with desirable properties for optoelectronics are fabricated by a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method. Photodetectors based on the thin films exhibit broad detection range from UV to mid&#8208;IR. Successful application of the devices as optical synapses is also presented. This work demonstrates the great potential of Cu3(HHTT)2 for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with efficient in&#8208;plane d&#8211;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films has never been reported until now. Here, the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer&#8208;scale Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method on various substrates is presented.

A facile anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition&#8208;based gold patterning method, which can&#160;direct print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post annealing is presented. The technique combines Digital Light Processing&#8208;based projection lithography with specific ion effects. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au is demonstrated, with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal transductions.








Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal&#8208;patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost have limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment, is introduced. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. The significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8722; ions, in the printing process is presented. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes are demonstrated with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. This work exploits the potential of photochemical&#8208;deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudosymmetric Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F, designed from asymmetric selenium substitution strategy promotes free charge generation to enhance exciton dissociation and suppress energy loss in sequentially processed organic solar cells, leading to a record power conversion efficiency of over 19%.








Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% is realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of the D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F is facilitated to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieve a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) can be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. The findings of using pseudosymmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Ion Polymer Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;ion polymer conductor (SIPC) with exceptional selectivity for lithium (Li)&#8208;ion conduction is synthesized. The optimized ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li&#8208;ions and carbonyl/cyano groups in the SIPC enable a high ionic conductivity, large Li&#8208;ion transference number, and wide electrochemical stability window. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the SIPC exhibit superb cycling performance at various current densities and temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual&#8208;ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single&#8208;ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;4.5&#160;V, vs Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#160;&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 90&#160;&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8211;dipole interaction regulation, sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal&#8208;ion systems beyond Li+.

         <title>High&#8208;Stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;Hysteresis ConductingPolymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting&#8208;polymer hydrogel strain sensor is proposed with both high stretchability (300% strain) and ultralow hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). The hydrogel&#8208;based sensor harnesses a unique microphase semiseparated network to achieve enhanced sensing properties. The fabricated sensor can be applied as electronic skins to monitor physiological signals, enable a soft gripper for object recognition and remote control of an industrial robot.








Abstract
Highly stretchable strain sensors based on conducting polymer hydrogel are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate toward diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting&#160;polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

The fabricated sensor can be applied as electronic skins to monitor physiological signals, enable a soft gripper for object recognition and remote control of an industrial robot.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly stretchable strain sensors based on conducting polymer hydrogel are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate toward diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting&#160;polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&amp;lt;1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze-thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by the High&#8208;Speed Solid&#8208;State Lithium Transport of an Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;transport matrix throughout the electrode is built up by a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode and realizes superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells under strict electrode conditions (areal capacity &gt;3 mAh cm&#8722;2, porosity &lt; 35%).








Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network is reported to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, it is demonstrated that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;concentration polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells are fabricated and tested under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells show a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite&#8208;anode&#8208;based cells (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries on the basis of high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bathochromic shift of a multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) is achieved by introducing cyano groups. The cyano&#8208;substituted material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) exhibits pure green emission with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode device exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency (31.9%), which is maintained (28.5%) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating a minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8722;1 is reported. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale d'&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based Printing of Leachable Salt Molds for Facile Shaping of Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolvable salt&#8208;printed templates allow shaping of hard&#8208;to&#8208;print materials. The control of photoadditive and diluent concentrations in the salt&#8208;based ink is essential to achieve high&#8208;resolution printing of crack&#8208;free objects. Optimal ink formulations enable shaping of materials for various applications from lightweight construction to 3D cell cultures.








Abstract
3D printing is a powerful manufacturing technology for shaping materials into complex structures. While the palette of printable materials continues to expand, the rheological and chemical requisites for printing are not always easy to fulfill. Here, a universal manufacturing platform is reported for shaping materials into intricate geometries without the need for their printability, but instead using light&#8208;based printed salt structures as leachable molds. The salt structures are printed using photocurable resins loaded with NaCl particles. The printing, debinding, and sintering steps involved in the process are systematically investigated to identify ink formulations enabling the preparation of crack&#8208;free salt templates. The experiments reveal that the formation of a load&#8208;bearing network of salt particles is essential to prevent cracking of the mold during the process. By infiltrating the sintered salt molds and leaching the template in water, complex&#8208;shaped architectures are created from diverse compositions such as biomedical silicone, chocolate, light metals, degradable elastomers, and fiber composites, thus demonstrating the universal, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable nature of this new manufacturing platform.

The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In ths work, 63.4% external quantum efficiency is achieved with ampicillin (antibiotic)&#8208;based top&#8208;emission OLEDs by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and scattering effect, simultaneously.








Abstract
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In this work, the efficiency of top&#8208;emission OLEDs (TEOLEDs) is enhanced by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). Moreover, Amp&#8208;MSs can adjust the charge balance by Fermi level (EF) alignment, thereby decreasing the leakage current. The decrease in the wave&#8208;guided modes can enhance the light outcoupling through optical scattering. The resulting TEOLED demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (maximum: 68.7% and average: 63.4% at spectroradiometer; maximum: 44.8% and average: 42.6% at integrating sphere) with a wider color gamut (118%) owing to the redshift of the spectrum by J&#8208;aggregation. Deconvolution of the EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp&#8208;MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical scattering by Amp&#8208;MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1%, and EL by J&#8208;aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.

Deconvolution of the EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp-MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical scattering by Amp-MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1%, and EL by J-aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concentrated Electrolytes Enabling Stable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase of a novel concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are unveiled by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The unique solvation structure of the concentrated electrolyte and the formed surface layer guarantee the full cell with a capacity retention of &#8776;72% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.2% after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising devices for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications because of their low&#8208;cost, inherent safety, and environmental friendliness. Among them, aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are currently emerging owing to the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to obtain stable AAIB with relatively high output potential, considering the instability of many electrode materials in an aqueous environment. Herein, a cell based on a concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte, ammonium copper hexacyanoferrate (N&#8208;CuHCF) as the positive electrode (cathode), and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) as the negative electrode (anode) is reported. The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, as well as the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and interphase are systematically investigated by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The results indicate a remarkable cycling performance of the low&#8208;cost rocking&#8208;chair AAIB, which offers a capacity retention of &#8776;72% after 1000 cycles and an average output potential of &#8776;1.0&#160;V.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is reported for the fabrication of lattice&#8208;tensile&#8208;strained Pd nanosheets with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. The in vivo tumor inhibition rate in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model of the strained Pd nanosheets is approximately five times higher than that of the pristine Pd nanosheets.








Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but approximately five times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Carrier Mobilities in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Corbino Cones at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoresistance is measured in conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in ferroelectric lithium niobate. Extracted carrier mobilities are extremely high, up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.








Abstract
Recently, electrically conducting heterointerfaces between dissimilar band insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport and fundamental aspects of conduction have been thoroughly explored. Perhaps surprisingly, similar studies on conceptually much simpler conducting homointerfaces, such as domain walls, are not nearly so well developed. Addressing this disparity, magnetoresistance is herein reported in approximately conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in partially switched ferroelectric thin&#8208;film single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: first, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is unusually large (a factor of 1013) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channeled along the walls; second, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes, then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disk: a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Data imply carriers with extremely high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides) comparable to mobilities in other systems seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black&#8208;Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterion formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) is deposited at the tin(IV) oxide (SnO2)/perovskite interface to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and also help reduce the side effect of the residual lead iodide (PbI2), yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.1% and 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow bandgap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black&#8208;phase crystallization and to eliminate the lead iodide (PbI2) residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite will introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure. Here a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is introduced as the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase FAPbI3. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation, and distribution of residual PbI2 in the perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8211;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami&#8208;patterned biodegradable metal electrodes are introduced to achieve biodegradable stretchable batteries with high power and energy density. The elastic electrodes exhibit excellent electrical performance under deformation. Combining molybdenum trioxide with magnesium yields stretchable cells with energy densities as high as 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2. The batteries can power a wearable biosensing patch, enabling on&#8208;skin monitoring of physiological signals.








Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste, and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#181;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict and Understand Complex Self&#8208;Assembly Behaviors of a Multicomponent Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of multicomponent nanocomposites is complex and cannot be predicted by theory alone. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative to experimental trial and error. In this work, 595 microscopy images of nanocomposites are used to train a series of ML models. The predictions provide insights into the system and suggest ML can significantly streamline the design of nanocomposites.








Abstract
Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self&#8208;assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure&#8208;dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non&#8208;equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high&#8208;dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy visualizes the chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of a single dendronized polymer diffusing in confined organic solvent. Direct observations show the equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium chain&#8208;dynamics of semiflexible polymers. The solvated semiflexible chain fluctuates between coiled and stretched conformations. Non&#8208;equilibrium chain motions including drag and cleavage, due to the interfacial interaction, are also observed.








Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semiflexible polymers. These experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single&#8208;chain polymer originate from the degree of intrachain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single&#8208;chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite with compressed surface lattice&#8208;structure can be made by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication process, which significantly enhances the ionic activation temperature and contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at high temperature up to 363 K, enabling efficient and stable PSCs fabricated by a high&#8208;speed post&#8208;annealing&#8208;free process in air with the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique.








Abstract
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication is shown. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8722;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and shows enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking&#8208;processed MAPbClxI3&#8722;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully air process without post&#8208;annealing based on the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 h.

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amorphous nickel borides electrocatalysts is developed for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), out of which, NiB2 demonstrates remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability. Furthermore, the dependence of 2e&#8722; ORR performance of amorphous nickel borides by tuning the atomic ratio of Ni and B is uncovered from the perspective of free&#8208;adsorption energy and dynamic charge transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8722;) selectivity, activity, and stability is crucial for driving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy is proposed to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8722;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8722; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory, unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni toward *OOH and reducing of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics to preserve the O&#63743;O bond.

Furthermore, the dependence of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR performance of amorphous nickel borides by tuning the atomic ratio of Ni and B is uncovered from the perspective of free-adsorption energy and dynamic charge transfer kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) selectivity, activity, and stability is crucial for driving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Herein, a composition engineering strategy is proposed to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with different amounts of BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivers the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 4.753&#160;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved upon assembling NiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X-ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory, unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni toward *OOH and reducing of the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics to preserve the O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Drug in Drug: A Host&#8211;Guest Formulation of Azocalixarene with Hydroxychloroquine for Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammation</title>

Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two hotspots in supramolecular biomedicine that have only been occasionally merged. In this work, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a therapeutically active macrocycle, forming a multifunctional supramolecular active ingredient. This drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug formulation achieves the advantages of macrocycles acting as both carriers and therapeutic agents to realize combinational therapy.








Abstract
Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two significant topics in supramolecular biomedicine. The functional integration of these topics would open new avenues for treating diseases synergistically. However, these two individual topics have only been occasionally merged, probably because of the lack of functionalized design of macrocyclic host and the lack of efficient recognition between host and guest drugs. Herein, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a macrocycle possessing therapeutic activity to form a multifunctional supramolecular active pharmaceutical ingredient. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a complex of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with sulfonated azocalix[4]arene (HCQ@SAC4A) is prepared to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a combined fashion. SAC4A is a therapeutic agent that exhibits scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. It is also a hypoxia&#8208;responsive carrier that can deliver HCQ directly to the inflammatory articular cavity. Consequently, HCQ@SAC4A achieves the synergistic anti&#8208;inflammatory effect on both inflamed RAW 264.7 cells and RA rats. This effect is attributed to the temporal and spatial consistency of the two active ingredients of the complex. As a new paradigm for combinational therapy, the drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug strategy advances in easy preparation, mix&#8208;and&#8208;match combination, and precise ratiometric control.

         <title>A Personalized Electronic Tattoo for Healthcare Realized by On&#8208;the&#8208;Spot Assembly of an Intrinsically Conductive and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of e&#8208;tattoo that can be directly implemented on the skin by rapid one&#8208;step coating with various designs at a multi&#8208;scale for personalized healthcare is introduced. The e&#8208;tattoo is realized by tuning the electrically conductive and mechanically durable liquid metal composite based suspension to have low repulsion between particles, excellent wettability, and high vapor pressure.








Abstract
Conventional electronic (e&#8208;) skins are a class of thin&#8208;film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here a new class of e&#8208;tattoos is introduced that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one&#8208;step coating with various designs at multi&#8208;scale depending on the purpose of the user without a substrate. An e&#8208;tattoo is realized by attaching Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nanotubes on gallium&#8208;based liquid&#8208;metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low&#8208;zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high&#8208;vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 s. Low&#8208;cost, ease of preparation, on&#8208;skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e&#8208;tattoos. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulators, photothermal patches, motion artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological sensors, and electrochemical biosensors validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e&#8208;tattoo&#8208;based approach in biomedical engineering.

         <title>Ultrahigh Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Materials from Spinodal Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;dissipative circuit element with considerably large inductance is indispensable for the noise&#8208;resilient superconducting qubits. Here, spinodal decomposition is utilized to achieve ultrahigh kinetic inductance in the superconducting materials. Model epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N thin films are used and a drastic enhancement in kinetic inductance by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude while maintaining a low microwave loss is demonstrated.








Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications. Despite continuing efforts toward reducing material dimensions to increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, achieving further improvements without compromising material quality has become a fundamental challenge. To this end, a method to drastically increase the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition while maintaining a low microwave loss is proposed. Epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N is used as a model system and the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material disorder is demonstrated. The measured kinetic inductance increases by two to three orders of magnitude compared with the best disordered superconducting nitrides reported to date. This work paves the way for substantially enhancing and deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting quantum&#160;circuits.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal catalyst from transition metal nitrides for room&#8208;temperature advanced Na&#8211;S batteries. Based on theoretical results, a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs) is designed and synthesized for S and Na electrodes, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na&#8211;S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared RT Na&#8211;S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. Even with high S loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the RT Na&#8211;S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm&#8211;2.

         <title>Fluorinated Perylene&#8208;Diimides: Cathode Interlayers Facilitating Carrier Collection for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of high&#8208;performance fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimide as cathode interlayers, making OSCs more promising.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, two fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs), PDINN&#8208;F and PDINN&#8208;2F, are synthesized by a simple fluorination method, for application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay&#8208;fluorinated PDI&#8208;based CILs possess a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of &#8776;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR&#8208;SMAs (such as BTP&#8208;eC9)/CIL for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The monofluorinated PDINN&#8208;F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short&#8208;circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN&#8208;F CIL retain more than 80% of their initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 h. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high&#8208;performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR&#8208;SMAs&#8208;based OSCs moving forward.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

         <title>Quantum Conductance in Memristive Devices: Fundamentals, Developments, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum conductance effects in memristive devices are reviewed, from fundamentals of electrochemical phenomena underlying memristive functionalities to ballistic electronic conduction transport in atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments. Related challenges in nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena at the nanoscale are analyzed together with opportunities and envisioned applications for memristive devices working in the quantum regime.








Abstract
Quantum effects in novel functional materials and new device concepts represent a potential breakthrough for the development of new information processing technologies based on quantum phenomena. Among the emerging technologies, memristive elements that exhibit resistive switching, which relies on the electrochemical formation/rupture of conductive nanofilaments, exhibit quantum conductance effects at room temperature. Despite the underlying resistive switching mechanism having been exploited for the realization of next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing architectures, the potentialities of quantum effects in memristive devices are still rather unexplored. Here, a comprehensive review on memristive quantum devices, where quantum conductance effects can be observed by coupling ionics with electronics, is presented. Fundamental electrochemical and physicochemical phenomena underlying device functionalities are introduced, together with fundamentals of electronic ballistic conduction transport in nanofilaments. Quantum conductance effects including quantum mode splitting, stability, and random telegraph noise are analyzed, reporting experimental techniques and challenges of nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena. Finally, potential applications and future perspectives are envisioned, discussing how memristive devices with controllable atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments can represent not only suitable platforms for the investigation of quantum phenomena but also promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum systems working in air at room temperature.

         <dc:description>
Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <title>Design Strategies for Structurally Controlled Polymer Surfaces via Cyclophane&#8208;Based CVD Polymerization and Post&#8208;CVD Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies for structurally&#160;controlled polymer surfaces via cyclophane&#8208;based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization with precise control over chemical functionalities, and post&#8208;CVD fabrication via orthogonal surface functionalization that facilitates the formation of designable biointerfaces are summarized. Particular discussion about CVD copolymerization for multifunctional surfaces, and templated&#8208;synthesis of structurally&#160;controlled CVD polymers, ranging from 1D to 3D architecture is provided.








Abstract
Molecular structuring of soft matter with precise arrangements over multiple hierarchical levels, especially on polymer surfaces, and enabling their post&#8208;synthetic modulation has tremendous potential for application in molecular engineering and interfacial science. Here, recent research and developments in design strategies for structurally controlled polymer surfaces via cyclophane&#8208;based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization with precise control over chemical functionalities and post&#8208;CVD fabrication via orthogonal surface functionalization that facilitates the formation of designable biointerfaces are summarized. Particular discussion about innovative approaches for the templated synthesis of shape&#8208;controlled CVD polymers, ranging from 1D to 3D architecture, including inside confined nanochannels, nanofibers/nanowires synthesis into an anisotropic media such as liquid crystals, and CVD polymer nanohelices via hierarchical chirality transfer across multiple length scales is provided. Aiming at multifunctional polymer surfaces via CVD copolymerization of multiple precursors, the structural and functional design of the fundamental [2.2]paracyclophane (PCP) precursor molecules, that is, functional CVD monomer chemistry is also described. Technologically advanced and innovative surface deposition techniques toward topological micro&#8208; and nanostructuring, including microcontact printing, photopatterning, photomask, and lithographic techniques such as dip&#8208;pen nanolithography, showcasing research from the authors&#8217; laboratories as well as other's relevant important findings in this evolving field are highlighted that have introduced new programmable CVD polymerization capabilities. Perspectives, current limitations, and future considerations are provided.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed the polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here we report a high&#8208;throughput selection method that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing (NGS) chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8764;40,000 activator sequences. We find the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12 of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6 and 2&#8211;4 are hotspots to generate yellow&#8208;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose a &#8220;zipper bag model&#8221; that could explain how these hotspots lead to the creation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter the chromophore chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine learning algorithms, we establish a pipeline to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

         <title>Suppressing Charged Cation Antisites via Se Vapor Annealing Enables p&#8208;Type Dopability in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe2 is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties while the origins of its intrinsic n&#8208;type conductivity remain speculative. Here, we demonstrate that cation disordering is facilitated by BiAg charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe2 which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly control the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we elucidate how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe2 alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures. With stable and controlled hole concentration, we can observe a peak in the weighted mobility and the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass in AgBiSnSe3, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. Our findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self&#8208;doping.

         <title>Cooperative Coupling of H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis Over Floatable Polystyrene Sphere&#8208;supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cooperative coupling of photocatalytic H2O2 production with organic synthesis has an expansive perspective in converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from severe agglomeration, limited light absorption, poor gas reactant accessibility and reusable difficulty, which greatly hinders their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, floatable composite photocatalysts are synthesized by immobilizing hydrophobic TiO2 and Bi2O3 on light&#8208;weight polystyrene (PS) spheres via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15&#160;mM h&#8722;1 and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S&#8208;scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in&#8208;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for high&#8208;efficient heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Functional MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MXenes are seen as an exceptional candidate to reshape the future of energy with their viable surface chemistry, ultrathin 2D structure and excellent electronic conductivity. The extensive research efforts bring about rapid expansion of the MXene families with enriched functionalities, which significantly boost performance of the existing energy storage devices. In this review, we highlight the strategies that developed to functionalize the MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inherited the merits of the MXene precursors. Their applications in the emerging battery technologies are demonstrated and discussed. With the delicate functionalization and structural engineering, MXene&#8208;based electrode materials exhibit improved specific capacity and rate capability, and their presence further suppresses and even eliminates the dendrite formation on the metal anodes, which elongates the lifespan of the rechargeable batteries. Meanwhile, MXenes have served as additives for electrolytes, separators and current collectors. Finally, we propose some future directions worth of exploration to address the remaining challenging issues of MXene&#8208;based materials and achieve the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost rechargeable batteries.

         <title>A Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for single&#8208;step fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity is presented for photolithography in a living manner. The spatial and temporal controllability of the surface configuration under visible light enables the regulation of the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive surface, and formation of aqueous/oil microdroplets arrays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and integrated enzyme biochips.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface is reported, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enables us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>An Initial Covalent Organic Polymer with Closed&#8208;F Edges Directly for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initial F&#8208;decorated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine covalent organic polymer is prepared, which delivers exceptional catalytic activity in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction and has capability to be directly applied into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells devices, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g., in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration toward electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an initial F&#8208;decorated fully closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F) is reported. The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens the occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step, exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.

         <title>Impact of Side Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;bithiophene Semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) force field for modelling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8216;tilted stack&#8217; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8216;deflected stack&#8217; and an s&#8208;bend side chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals &#8208; through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways tri&#8208;ethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a meta&#8208;stable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side chain length dependance. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Memristor based on an Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Dynamical Structure Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule memristor with long&#8208;lasting retained memory states, high write&#8211;erase endurance, and adjustable on/off ratio is realized by a novel mechanism&#8212;dynamical structure reconfiguration in the Fries rearrangement. Precise manipulation of the potential energy surface of the reaction by external electric fields can retain and switch the corresponding desired species along the reaction coordinate to achieve a memory effect.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor is prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching is realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments, therefore unveiling both intramolecular and intermolecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states are achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8211;Chlorambucil Conjugate as a Type&#8208;II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemotherapeutic type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA&#8208;Cbl. with fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long&#8208;lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA&#8208;Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy&#8208;metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer, SA&#8208;Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress&#8208;inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive organic fluorophores.

         <title>Recent Advances on High&#8208;Performance Polyaryletherketone Materials for Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the additive manufacturing (AM) of polyaryletherketone (PAEK) materials are comprehensively reviewed, regarding the material properties, processing&#8211;matter interaction mechanisms, mechanical properties of additively manufactured PAEKs, and their potential applications. The challenges facing AM technologies, possible solutions, and future perspectives are provided for the further development of high&#8208;performance AM materials.








Abstract
Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) is emerging as an important high&#8208;performance polymer material in additive manufacturing (AM) benefiting from its excellent mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and high&#8208;temperature stability. The distinct advantages of AM facilitate the rapid development of PAEK products with complex customized structures and functionalities, thereby enhancing their applications in various fields. Herein, the recent advances on AM of high&#8208;performance PAEKs are comprehensively reviewed, concerning the materials properties, AM processes, mechanical properties, and potential applications of additively manufactured PAEKs. To begin, an introduction to fundamentals of AM and PAEKs, as well as the advantages of AM of PAEKs is provided. Discussions are then presented on the material properties, AM processes, processing&#8211;matter coupling mechanism, thermal conductivity, crystallization characteristics, and microstructures of AM&#8208;processed PAEKs. Thereafter, the mechanical properties and anisotropy of additively manufactured PAEKs are discussed in depth. Their representative applications in biomedical, aerospace, electronics, and other fields are systematically presented. Finally, current challenges and possible solutions are discussed for the future development of high&#8208;performance AM polymers.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection using 1D Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasable water charge&#8208;trapping is observed from the transient absorption spectra in a quasi&#8208;1D perovskitoid single&#8208;crystal hydrate, and a dynamic model is proposed to interpret the charge trapping and release processes. Besides, water&#8208;resistant photodetection devices are fabricated based on this single crystal.








Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN2+), a stable quasi&#8208;1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this design, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 25% Realized by Co&#8208;Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing m&#8208;F&#8208;PEA and NMAI to act as large organic cations in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, the phase distribution control and defect passivation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films are realized. As a result, excellent red light emission is achieved with recorded efficiency as high as 25.8% and the maximum luminance exceeding 1300 cd cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have received great attention in recent years due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important parts for lighting and displays. Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites can deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. In this work, the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite is finely controlled by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduces the amount of smaller n&#8208;index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs show 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibits the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

         <title>Intelligent Micro&#8208;/Nanorobots for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on the recent advances of micro&#8208;/nanorobots&#8208;based cancer theragnostic is presented, ranging from actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery, as well as highlighting the most promising research opportunities for the next decade that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro&#8208;/nanorobot (MNR)&#8208;assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR&#8208;based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles, which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re &lt;&lt; 1) environment by effective self&#8208;propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next&#8208;generation cancer&#8208;therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging&#8208;guided operation, and biosensing are additionally studied to enable the promising cancer&#8208;related applications of MNRs. Herein, the recent advances in MNR&#8208;based cancer therapy are comprehensively addresses, including actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; promising research opportunities that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade is highlighted.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here we report a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron conduction and mass transport interfaces into the catalytic materials. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increased activity by two orders of magnitude, enhanced selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broadened voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions. Our results open a way to precise interfacial design for actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO2.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar discontinuity at the interface between ferromagnetic insulating double&#8208;perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and SrTiO3 triggers the formation of Mn3+ at both LNMO interfaces. Such electron doping is detrimental to Ni/Mn ordering and Curie temperature of films thinner than 10 uc. Engineering the charge transfer with a LaNiO3 overlayer results in optimized ferromagnetic properties, only restricted by dimensionality effects.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in bulk materials but can also lead to degraded properties in ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control charge transfer will be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remote manipulation of the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrent restoration of the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cell LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of complex multilayered heterostructures.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atoms as a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for the Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts on Ti defect&#8208;rich Ti3C2Tx MXene are fabricated via a combined defect&#8208;trapping and &#8220;self&#8208;reduction&#8221; process. The optimal Ni SACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene at a Ni loading of 2.93 wt% exhibit superior&#160;catalytic performance for the electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction, which is attributed to the optimal electronic density of states that enhances the adsorption energy and lowers the reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging&#160;as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self&#8208;reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx ) show an ultralow onset potential of &#8722;0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their&#160;surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. The results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapping strategy.

         <title>Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia at Ultralow Concentrations Via an Enrichment Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles encapsulated with porous carbon framework are developed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate (NO3&#8722;) electroreduction at ultralow concentrations. Benefiting from the enrichment effect of porous carbon framework, the yield rate of NH3 for the electrocatalyst reached 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to ammonia (NH3)&#160;offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultralow NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultralow concentrations is developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in a porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Cu@C achieves Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;, which is 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C is 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism reveals that NO3&#8722; can be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultralow concentrations.

         <title>Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking Cusingle&#8208;atom catalyst enables a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability in nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved.








Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cusingle&#8208;atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable K&#8211;Te battery is successfully fabricated. The kinetic barrier in the thick Te cathode is knocked down by the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te as a fast ionic pathway, and meanwhile, the K&#8208;metal anode is stabilized by electrolyte regulation. This approach could be extended to other low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).








Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge&#8208;transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K&#8208;metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

This approach could be extended to other low-temperature alkali-metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge-transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high-areal-capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low-temperature high-areal-capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self-reconstruction of amorphous Cu&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro-sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K-metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low-temperature batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, chiral organoboron structures are prepared by direct bonding of two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) monocores, realizing superior chiroptical property and dual&#8208;channel enhanced ultrapure blue emission. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% are achieved.








Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) are directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF monocores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a monocore structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6%, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) &#8776; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>A Van Der Waals Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Device and Circuit Based on Tunable Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is proposed. Following the successful verification of the tunability of multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance phenomenon, the reconfigurability in terms of the function of multi&#8208;valued logic circuits, from ternary inverter to latch circuit, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, a reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is reported, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. Reconfigurability is verified in terms of the function of an MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;specificity electronic device based on an interface&#8208;engineered field&#8208;effect transistor biosensor is engineered for non&#8208;invasive urinalysis. The urinalysis device achieves the reliable identification of five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in urine samples. Integrated with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, the device realizes a 95.0% bladder cancer diagnosis accuracy and can classify cancer stages with a 90.0% accuracy.








Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;bladder&#160;cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels (VR&#8208;evaporator) is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance for solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity, thereby achieving a groundbreaking overall performance.








Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels, and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, salinity of 20&#160;wt%, and a continuous 8&#160;h evaporation is achieved, which thought to be the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nanoprecipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the construction of novel local heterostructures of polar nanoregions and endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar core in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, an unprecedentedly large hysteresis&#8208;free strain is achieved under a low stimulated electric field, which is suitable for the application of ultrahigh precision actuator systems. The new strategy can open a new realm for the design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric relaxors.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric is designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33 (8 &#215; 10&#8722;16 m2 V&#8722;2) is achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it is observed that such superior electrostrictive properties can be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nanoprecipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Micro&#8211;Nano Fibers via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8211;nano Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric fibers with an interfacial engineering effect are fabricated by thermal drawing. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT &#8776; 1.4) at 300 K and show a reversible bending radius smaller than 50 &#181;m, approaching the theoretical limit of elastic strain. This fabrication strategy works for large&#8208;scale inorganic thermoelectric materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts have been&#160;of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers toward room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, interfacial&#8208;engineering&#8208;enhanced TE properties of micro&#8211;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template are reported. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8776;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#181;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Halide Remixing under Device Operation Imparts Stability on Mixed&#8208;Cation Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite compositions represent a promising route toward achieving stable and efficient solar cells. Here, the structural evolution of these absorber layers during full device operation is investigated via operando X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. A stabilizing compressive strain effect leading to the remixing of the halide population is unveiled, providing insight into new strategies toward increased device lifetimes and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap&#8208;tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration, however, continue to hinder their further progress. Here, an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique is used to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, it is demonstrated that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;ofplane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Building Practical High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. The key links in the development of the high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization are considered and an overview of the challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high&#8208;voltage cathode is presented.








Abstract
It has long been a global imperative to develop high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the ever&#8208;growing electric vehicle market. One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of LIBs is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. As the most&#8208;promising cathodes for high&#8208;voltage LIBs (&gt;4&#160;V vs Li/Li+), four major categories of cathodes including lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides, nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides, spinel oxides, and high&#8208;voltage polyanionic compounds still encounter severe challenges to realize the improvement of output voltage while maintaining high capacity, fast rate capability, and long service life. This review focuses on the key links in the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from the lab to industrialization. First, the failure mechanisms of the four kinds of materials are clarified, and the optimization strategies, particularly solutions that are easy for large&#8208;scale production, are considered. Then, to bridge the gap between lab and industry, the cost management, safety assessment, practical battery&#8208;performance evaluation, and sustainability of the battery technologies, are discussed. Finally, tough challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials are summarized to promote the large&#8208;scale application of LIBs with high energy densities.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dynamic mechanical action is achieved by a proposed near&#8208;distance mechanoluminescence (ML) imaging scheme and an enhanced mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The developed portable ML stress sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a threshold of &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution with a pixel size &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m, and fast response of &#8776;3.3&#160;ms.

Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micrometer&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude is developed by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is the main contributor to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8776;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254&#160;dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables use in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring, and human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tomographic microscopy techniques are applied to image the 3D&#160;network of ferroelectric domain walls in ErMnO3 with nanoscale spatial resolution. The study reveals how electrical currents propagate through the domain wall network and demonstrates the importance of local corrugation phenomena for the electronic transport behavior.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of nonvolatile memory, memristor technology, and electronic components with ultrasmall feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D&#160;material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. In this work, the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties is demonstrated, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modeling, the contribution of domain walls within the bulk is clarified and the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction is shown down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain&#8208;wall&#8208;based technology.

         <title>Ultratough Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Bridged Phosphorene Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The rapid development of flexible electronic devices, especially based on two&#8208;dimensional(2D) materials, has triggered the demand for high&#8208;strength materials. Mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer phosphorene with excellent electronic properties has attracted extensive attention. However, phosphorene is affected by its low Young's modulus when applied to flexible electronic devices. Here, we report a strategy via ion intercalation to significantly improve the mechanical properties of black phosphorus to generate hydrogen&#8208;bond bridged phosphorene films (HBPFs) with Youngs's modulus as high as 316&#160;GPa. This value is several times larger than the theoretical values of 166&#160;GPa in the zigzag direction, 44&#160;GPa in the armchair direction, and the averaged Young's modulus among all directions of 94&#160;GPa. The impact of intercalation on mechanical properties was also explored. Experimental nanoindentation results obtained by atomic force microscopy indicate that the relationship between the ratio of intercalated ions to phosphorus atoms and the corresponding Young's modulus satisfies the formula E=eae&#8722;lnx+b2c0&lt;x&#8804;1.80$E\; = {e}^{a{e}^{{{ - {{\left[ {\ln \left( x \right) + b} \right]}}^2} \over c}}}\left( {0 &amp;lt; x\; \le \;1.80} \right)$. Furthermore, a flexible NO2 gas sensor device based on this ultratough material presents excellent performance, even after 10000 bending cycles. Our results provide new insight into the potential for practical applications of black phosphorus devices.

         <title>Piezoelectricity across Two&#8208;dimensional Phase Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectricity in low dimensional materials and&#160;metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions has attracted recent attention. We investigate a 2D in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;semiconductor junction made of multilayer 2H and 1T' phases of MoTe2 structure. Strong piezoelectric response is observed using piezoresponse force microscopy at the 2H&#8208;1T&#8217; junction, despite that the multilayers of each individual phase are weakly piezoelectric. Our&#160;experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the amplified piezoelectric response observed at the junction is due to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.

Abstract
Recent improvements in the performances of solution&#8208;processed semiconductor materials and optoelectronic devices have shifted research interest to the diversification/advancement of their functionality. Embedding a molecular switch capable of transition between two or more metastable isomers by light stimuli is one of the most straightforward and widely accepted methods to potentially realize the multifunctionality of optoelectronic devices. A molecular switch embedded in a semiconductor can effectively control various parameters such as trap&#8208;level, dielectric constant, electrical resistance, charge mobility, and charge polarity, which can be utilized in photoprogrammable devices including transistors, memory, and diodes. This review classifies the mechanism of each optoelectronic transition driven by molecular switches regardless of the type of semiconductor material or molecular switch or device. In addition, the basic characteristics of molecular switches and the persisting technical/scientific issues corresponding to each mechanism are discussed to help researchers. Finally, interesting yet infrequently reported applications of molecular switches and their mechanisms are also described.

         <title>Rationally Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator Arrays for Harvesting Water Current Energy and Self&#8208;powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Water current energy is an enormous and widely distributed clean energy in nature, with different scales from large ocean flow to small local turbulence. However, few effective technologies have been proposed to make use of different forms of water currents as a power source. Here, high&#8208;performance paired triboelectric nanogenerators (P&#8208;TENGs) capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface (STS) is demonstrated for harvesting water current energy. Novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8208;flexible coupling deformation mechanism are introduced to ensure the device can work highly effectively even in deep water under high water pressure. The rationally designed TENG array in the STS enables highly efficient power take&#8208;off from the flow. Typically, the STS demonstrates high&#8208;frequency output up to 57&#160;Hz, largely superior to current TENG devices, and the power density is improved by over 100 times for triboelectric devices harvesting current energy. The flexible STS is capable of attaching to various surfaces or applying independently for self&#8208;powered sensing and underwater power supply, showing great potential for water current energy utilization. Moreover, the work also initiates universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency devices under large environment pressure, which may profoundly enrich the design of TENGs.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterning nanoporous inorganic films by lithography remains a challenge for their integration into functional devices. Liquid deposition of aqueous inks can form patterns via self&#8208;ordering of cracks over several centimeters in both 2D and 3D. The method is chemically versatile and is shown to successfully pattern more than ten functional materials. Periodic arrays of cracks then serve as photonic sensors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality often needs time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. Aqueous inks, containing inorganic precursors and polymeric latexes enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy is generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulating, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive, or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables 3D self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of a self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several centimeters) in a robust and controlled way.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy&#8208;storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8776;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer&#8208;based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#181;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat&#8208;transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8776;3.94% of the total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers toward smart energy&#8208;storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.

         <title>Experimental Realization of a Superdispersion&#8208;enabled Ultrabroadband Terahertz Cloak</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest owning to the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics, but still faces open challenges after its tremendous development in recent decades. One of the big challenges is the narrow bandwidth, as the realization of an invisibility cloak is usually based on a metamaterial &#8211; an artificial composite material composed of subwavelength resonator structures that are always associated with dispersion. Different from previous works that tried to eliminate the material dispersion to enhance the bandwidth of the invisibility cloak, in this paper, we find that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, one can still significantly increase the bandwidth of the cloak. Interestingly, the material dispersion does not violate the law of causality. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate an ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) carpet cloak through an array of superdispersive microparticles, rendering the target object invisible to the detection of both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain wideband systems. Our work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications and may pave a brand&#8208;new way for the development of dispersion&#8208;dominated ultrabroadband metadevices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting&#8208;Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot casting is shown to allow for reduced loading of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in perovskite precursor inks, and remnant DMSO in films. This suppresses formation of undesired byproducts. The resulting perovskite layers show fewer defects, while their solar cells exhibit superior operational stability under considerable UV&#8208;containing simulated solar exposure over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8211;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;containing continuous light exposure.

Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as-spin-coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so-called hot-casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best-performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post-burn-in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post-burn-in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)-containing continuous light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges and Perspectives of Organic Multivalent Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges faced by organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries and the possible strategies to solve such challenges are summarized. As a special challenge that organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined. The perspectives are thereby elaborated with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.








Abstract
Rechargeable organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) have attracted a surge of interest as promising alternatives for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications because they can combine the advantages of both organic electrodes and multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of organic MMIBs is hampered by many factors, which mean they lag far behind organic alkali&#8208;metal&#8208; (e.g., Li&#8208;, Na&#8208;, and K&#8208;) ion batteries. Herein, the challenges that are specifically faced by organic MMIBs are analyzed and the strategies that can probably solve such challenges are then discussed. As a special challenge that organic MMIBs are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined to deeply understand the structure&#8211;property relationships for guiding the future design of high&#8208;performance organic electrodes for MMIBs. The perspectives are thereby elaborated in this review with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.

Abstract
This review outlines requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuro&#8208;electronics. Neuro&#8208;electronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of biological nerves system, is being developed to overcome limitations of complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantations and daily&#8208;life usage. We review examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings, and highlight recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, then discuss further requirements for neuroprosthetics. Finally, we discuss future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuro&#8208;electronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure as Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of photodynamic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with surface mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) is developed to achieve self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining excellent immunogenic cell death and lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaera&#8208;like multivalent programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1&#160;blockade. SPSS NPs can not only effectively suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, a new kind of semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles is developed, featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The SPs with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which can massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic NP surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#160;in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs can not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <title>A Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High&#8208;Performance Blue Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.








Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge&#8208;shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability.

     alt="A Euryhaline-Fish-Inspired Salinity Self-Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High-Performance Blue Energy Harvesters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sandwich-structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self-adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high-performance salinity-gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich-structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self-adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high-performance salinity-gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane-based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The salinity-adaptive membrane solves the surface charge-shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. New routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with a facile spraying fabrication process, this STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature&#8208;indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.








Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast, and contactless.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics&#8208;Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich MoS2 QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two&#8208;stage synthesis begins with a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of original MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur&#8208;vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Defect-rich MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization-assisted bottom-up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization-assisted bottom-up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; QDs (B-QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two-stage synthesis begins with a bottom-up synthesis of original MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; QDs (O-QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur-vacancy defects to eventually form B-QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo-oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to lower gap energy (&#8710;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) between S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility. The experimental results reveal that the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and cannot overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect is explored. Specifically, only the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity, while the others do not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances the&#160;cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e&#8208;skin with a six&#8208;layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of metals with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study and electrochemical tests demonstrate the improved electrodeposition/dissolution behavior, lower polarization, and higher average coulombic efficiency for P2S5 and MoS2.








Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8776;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8776;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8776;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent-free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In-operando study of P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;4000 h, &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;8&lt;b&gt;&#215;&lt;/b&gt; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;70% higher when P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (&lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large-scale artificial solid-electrolyte-interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Snakeskin&#8208;Inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;Adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Survivability in complex environments is in high demand but challenging in flexible electronics or soft robotics. Snakeskin can serve as bioinspiration for employing electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) as a generic strategy to protect itself&#160;and the underlying objects from external damage. Specifically, a new concept of flexible &#8220;E&#8208;armor&#8221; as an upgrade of soft &#8220;E&#8208;skin&#8221; is introduced.








Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armor or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) is proposed, which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of the kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of the soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying a conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous organic cages with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented and the structure&#8211;property relationships between the nature of the side&#8208;chains and the gas sorption behavior toward highly potent greenhouse gases, namely, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are studied. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.








Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands of times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. To date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor of other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here, a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allow the study of the structure&#8211;property relationship between the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains and the gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, nonfluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.

         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber&#8208;shaped structures, stable in all&#8208;aqueous physiological&#8208;relevant conditions. Perfusable and size&#8208;controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two&#8208;phase systems, self&#8208;standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.








Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non&#8208;spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free&#8208;standing character, mobility and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, the fabrication of self&#8208;standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all&#8208;aqueous interfacial assembly is shown, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer&#8208;based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures can be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&#8722;1. The materials are used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and can be tailored to promote cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, for example, cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.

Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitin nanocrystals can be sustainably extracted from mushrooms and shrimp shells. These elongated nanoparticles spontaneously organize in water to form a chiral nematic mesophase. Upon evaporation, this helicoidal architecture is preserved, resulting in structurally colored films. An alkaline post&#8208;treatment to convert chitin into chitosan is found to significantly enhance the birefringence, resulting in vibrant red, green, and blue coloration.








Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Anchored Tubular g&#8208;C3N4 Catalysts for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Roles of High&#8208;Valency Iron&#8208;Oxo Species and Organic Radicals</title>

Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a functional encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage void with abundant pore structure and enriched Zn single atom sites in the inner wall is presented here. Zn single atoms provide abundant selective sodiophilic nucleation sites. Due to the rich pore structure, ZIF&#8208;derived carbon shells can provide geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels to maintain fast electron/ion contact, benefiting for encapsulating large amounts of metallic sodium.








Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, an Unheeded&#160;Killer of Mg Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An astonishingly uniform electroplating morphology is proven under practical current density and areal capacity in rechargeable Mg batteries, and an asymmetric phenomenon between the plating and stripping processes is discovered. More critically, a nonlinear volcano relation between the non&#8208;uniformity of the stripping morphology and the current density is proposed, which is defined by the distribution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions at the interface.








Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/stripping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode when cycling under a practical areal capacity (&gt;4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2), is of rising concern. The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, it is illustrated that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in a wide range of current densities (&#8804;5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2). However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under moderate current densities (0.1&#8211;1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode or short circuit of the battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in situ spectroscopy, it is illustrated that this current&#8208;dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of the Mg&#8208;metal anode must be considered comprehensively for practical Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers for (semi&#8208;)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor component. An in&#8208;depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in&#8208;depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.








Abstract
The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs).

Photoactive Materials
Next&#8208;generation photovoltaics will be lightweight, flexible, and (semi)transparent. Highly transparent organic photoactive materials are reported by Thuc&#8208;Quyen Nguyen, Viktor Brus, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203796. The changes in the fundamental processes in solar cells comprising a near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing acceptor and a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor are revealed upon dilution of the donor material, paving the way for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions based on semitransparent organic photovoltaics.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Intrinsically stretchable light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming increasingly important for wearable electronics. In article number 2203040, Han&#8208;Young Woo, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report the design of highly efficient ISOLEDs that use a graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrode. As a benefit of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with efficient electron injection capability, the ISOLED yields an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3 cd A&#8722;1.

A comprehensive overview of fully stretchable organic solar cells (f&#8208;SOSCs), including essential studies to make each layer of an f&#8208;SOSC stretchable and efficient is provided. Various strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control, are emphasized.








Abstract
Recent advances in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have greatly enhanced their commercial viability. Considering the technical standards (e.g., mechanical robustness) required for wearable electronics, which are promising application platforms for OSCs, the development of fully stretchable OSCs (f&#8208;SOSCs) should be accelerated. Here, a comprehensive overview of f&#8208;SOSCs, which are aimed to reliably operate under various forms of mechanical stress, including bending and multidirectional stretching, is provided. First, the mechanical requirements of f&#8208;SOSCs, in terms of tensile and cohesion/adhesion properties, are summarized along with the experimental methods to evaluate those properties. Second, essential studies to make each layer of f&#8208;SOSCs stretchable and efficient are discussed, emphasizing strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control. Key improvements to the other components/layers (i.e., substrate, electrodes, and interlayers) are also covered. Lastly, considering that f&#8208;SOSC research is in its infancy, the current challenges and future prospects are explored.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is prospected.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of E. coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, we develop a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), we chose YCW as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. We demonstrate that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

         <title>Suppressing the Loss of Polymer&#8208;based Dielectrics for High Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectrics have received intensive interest from academic community in the field of high&#8208;power energy storage owing to their superior flexibility and fast charge&#8208;discharge ability. Recently, how to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8208;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. Some achievements have been made in analyzing the source of loss and suppressing loss via Edison's trial and error method. In this review, the significance of suppressing loss in polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is firstly emphasized. Then, different sources of loss are discussed carefully and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the related measurements is presented. Next, recent research results in suppressing loss are summarized and discussed and discussed in detail according to different strategies. Lastly, the challenges and opportunities in the loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.

         <title>Accurate wavelength tracking by exciton spin mixing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wavelength discriminating systems typically consist of heavy benchtop&#8208;based instruments, comprising diffractive optics, moving parts, and adjacent detectors. For simple wavelength measurements, such as lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip light source calibration or laser wavelength tracking, which do not require polychromatic analysis and cannot handle bulky spectroscopy instruments, light&#8208;weight, easy&#8208;to&#8208;process, and flexible single&#8208;pixel devices are attracting increasing attention. Here, we propose a device for monotonously transforming wavelength information into the time domain with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence at the heart of its functionality that demonstrates a resolution down to one nanometer and below. It is solution&#8208;processed from a single host&#8208;guest system comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloidal quantum dots. The share of excited triplet states within the photoluminescent layer is dependent on the excitation wavelength and determines the afterglow intensity of the film, which is tracked by a simple photodetector. Finally, an all&#8208;organic thin&#8208;film wavelength sensor and two applications are demonstrated where our novel measurement concept successfully replaces a full spectrometer.

Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anode offers a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of Li metal during charge results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, we propose a facile one&#8208;step roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication of a zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion Li metal composite anode (zeroVE&#8208;Li) to realize the outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. The zeroVE&#8208;Li possesses a sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron&#8208;insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates the volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0 mAh cm&#8211;2. Pairing zeroVE&#8208;Li with commercial NMC811 or LCO cathode, we demonstrate flexible LMBs that offer a record&#8208;breaking Figure of Merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole&#8208;cell energy density (375&#160;Wh L&#8211;1, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high&#8208;capacity retention (&gt;99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal anode offers a promising solution for high-energy-density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of Li metal during charge results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, we propose a facile one-step roll-to-roll fabrication of a zero-volume-expansion Li metal composite anode (zeroVE-Li) to realize the outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability of high-energy-density LMBs. The zeroVE-Li possesses a sandwich-like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron-insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates the volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Pairing zeroVE-Li with commercial NMC&lt;sub&gt;811&lt;/sub&gt; or LCO cathode, we demonstrate flexible LMBs that offer a record-breaking Figure of Merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole-cell energy density (375&#160;Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high-capacity retention (&amp;gt;99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enabling Electron Injection for Microbial Electrosynthesis with n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1 with a newly synthesized n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte forms a 3D conductive network that allows efficient electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.








Abstract
Microbial electrosynthesis&#8212;using renewable electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism&#8212;holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. A key limitation hindering performance is slow electron&#8208;transfer rates at biotic&#8211;abiotic interfaces. Here a new n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte is rationally designed and synthesized and its use is demonstrated as a soft conductive material to encapsulate electroactive bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1. The self&#8208;assembled 3D living biocomposite amplifies current uptake from the electrode &#8776;674&#8208;fold over controls with the same initial number of cells, thereby enabling continuous synthesis of succinate from fumarate. Such functionality is a result of the increased number of bacterial cells having intimate electronic communication with the electrode and a higher current uptake per cell. This is underpinned by the molecular design of the polymer to have an n&#8208;dopable conjugated backbone for facile reduction by the electrode and zwitterionic side chains for compatibility with aqueous media. Moreover, direct arylation polycondensation is employed instead of the traditional Stille polymerization to avoid non&#8208;biocompatible tin by&#8208;products. By demonstrating synergy between living cells with n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials, these results provide new strategies for improving the performance of bioelectrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Porosity MgO Microparticles for Heat&#8208;Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By making the MgO particles ultrahighly porous, the structural collapse due to volume changes is minimized when hydration and dehydration reactions occur. Additionally, upon using a very large reaction surface, pure MgO not only reaches 90.3% of the theoretical storage value, but also reaches a high reaction rate. The stability of the heat storage and release cycle is confirmed.








Abstract
Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy. Among such systems, the hydration and dehydration reactions of MgO/Mg(OH)2&#160;are eco&#8208;friendly, have relatively low toxicity and risk, and have a large reserves. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for a heat&#8208;storage system. In this study, ultrahigh&#8208;porosity particles are used to maximize the heat&#8208;storage efficiency of pure MgO. Due to its large surface area, the heat storage rate is 90.3% of the theoretical value and the reaction rate is very high. In addition, as structural collapse, likely to be caused by volume changes between reactions, is blocked as the porous region is filled and emptied, the cycle stability is secured. Ultrahigh&#8208;porosity MgO microparticles can be used to build eco&#8208;friendly heat&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Driven Ultrafast Crystallization of Perovskite Films Under Heavy Humidity for Efficient Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air is conducive to low&#8208;cost commercial production, nevertheless it is rather difficult to achieve comparable device performance as that in an inert atmosphere because of poor moisture toleration of perovskite materials. Here, the perovskite crystallization process was systematically studied using two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in inert atmosphere (glovebox) and air. We found that moisture can stabilize solvation intermediates and prevent their conversion into perovskite crystals. To address this issue, we used thermal radiation to accelerate perovskite crystallization for integrated perovskite films within 10 s in air. The as&#8208;formed perovskite films were compact, highly oriented with giant grain size, superior photoelectric properties, and low trap density. When the films were applied to PSC devices, we obtained a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.8%, one of the best results for air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs under high relative humidity (60&#177;10%). This work substantially assists understanding and modulation to perovskite crystallization kinetics under heavy humidity. Also, the ultrafast conversion strategy by thermal radiation provides unprecedented opportunities to manufacture high&#8208;quality perovskite films for low&#8208;temperature, eco&#8208;friendly, and air&#8208;processed efficient inverted PSCs.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Stability of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Existing Issues and Mitigation Strategies Related to both Material and Device Aspects</title>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieve operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, we consider the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs. We then review the strategies on improving the stability of perovskite materials such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, we consider use of inorganic charge transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management. We conclude this review with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright and efficient perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Advances in Colloidal Building Blocks: Toward Patchy Colloidal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A scalable synthetic route to colloidal atoms has significantly advanced over the past two decades. Recently, colloidal clusters with DNA&#8208;coated cores called &#8220;patchy colloidal clusters&#8221; have been developed, providing a directional bonding with specific angle of rotation due to the shape complementarity between colloidal clusters. Through a DNA&#8208;mediated interlocking process, they were directly assembled into low&#8208;coordination colloidal structures, such as cubic diamond lattices. This review details the significant progress in recent years in the synthesis of&#160;patchy colloidal clusters and their assembly in experiments and simulations. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the emerging approaches to the patchy colloidal clusters and their potential applications in photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonic insulators, and separation membranes.

         <title>A Soft Magnetoelastic Generator for Wind Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limits our ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources such as wind energy which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, we report a fundamentally new wind energy harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in a soft system, which converts wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind energy harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68 &#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a power density of 0.82&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 under ambient natural winds. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5 &#215; 10&#8211;2&#160;mL h&#8211;1 with a wind speed of 20 m/s. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves way for wind energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization

&lt;p&gt;The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limits our ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources such as wind energy which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, we report a fundamentally new wind energy harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Wind-induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in a soft system, which converts wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind energy harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68 &#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a power density of 0.82&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; under ambient natural winds. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mL h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a wind speed of 20 m/s. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves way for wind energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>

Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate immune response, but immunosuppressive microenvironment associated T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle (NP) was developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

         <title>Optothermally Programmable Liquids with Spatiotemporal Precision and Functional Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the intrinsic lack of spatial order and self&#8208;supported shape, liquids are often incompatible with precision manufacturing/processing and are potentially limited for advanced functionality. Herein, we develop an optothermal strategy to fully command phase&#8208;separated liquids with unprecedent spatiotemporal addressability. Specifically, we focus a laser onto an Au film to create a hot spot that locally demixes a temperature&#8208;responsive solution to produce a single optothermal droplet. Spatial precision (&#8764; 1 micron) is assured by the well&#8208;defined thermal field and temporal accuracy (&#8764; 0.1 s) guaranteed by the fast heating and response rate. Time&#8208;multiplexed laser foci are deployed to engineer the thermal landscape as desired, which in turn dictates the formation/dissolution, positioning, shaping, and dynamic reconfiguration of the phase&#8208;separated liquids. We further program laser foci to orchestrate the liquid patterns in a time&#8208;continuous manner to produce liquid animations on the microscale with high fidelity. While focused laser has been routinely used to manipulate solid particles or to microfabricate solid materials, the current strategy embraces the merits of liquid and features functional complexity in information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization. We expect it to be further applicable in scenarios such as subcellular organization of biomolecular condensates and programmable modulation of nonequilibrium systems.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future.

     alt="Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next-Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next-generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar-fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game-changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;driven Mixed&#8208;phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>

Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 solid solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, and detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2 domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2 domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2 domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>Design Strategies for Hydroxyapatite&#8208;based Materials to Enhance Their Catalytic Performance and Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a green catalyst which has a wide range of applications in the catalysis due to its high flexibility and multi&#8208;functionality. These properties allow HAP to accommodate a large number of catalyst modifications that can selectively improve the catalytic performance in target reactions. To date, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of HAP modification on the catalytic activities for various reactions. However, systematic design strategies for HAP catalysts are not established yet due to incomplete understanding of underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. In this review, tuning methods of HAP for improving the catalytic performance are discussed: (1) ionic composition change, (2) morphology control, (3) incorporation of other metal species, and (4) catalytic support engineering. We investigate detailed mechanisms and effects of structural modulations on the catalytic performances for attaining the design insights of HAP catalysts. In addition, computational studies to understand catalytic reactions on HAP materials are also introduced. Finally, important areas for future research are highlighted.

         <title>One&#8208;phototransistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor Array with High&#8208;linearity Light&#8208;tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>

Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate a highly&#8208;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor for the implementation of optic artificial neural networks (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment an OANN was constructed using a 16&#215;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it was trained on an online platform. The model yielded an accuracy of 99.3% after only 10 training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrated its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradictious conclusions on the reporting of crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appeared in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, we clarified the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals. Although the TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominating {001} and {111} facets are always co&#8208;existing due to the similarities in lattice fringes and intersection angles between two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in [111] direction). We also give a paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability towards Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly (amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, we build a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylic acid) interfacial layer on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Polishing Lead&#8208;Poor Surface for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structure. However, achieving inverted devices which provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices, remains a challenge and the deep insights are still unintelligible. In this study, we&#160; found that the surface components of CsPbI3 were&#160; intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps were&#160; of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induced inferior electrons transfer and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination at CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable opening&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and filling factor (FF) reduction. Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine (DAB) could&#160; eliminate the non&#8208;stoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improved the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices was&#160; maintained after the output operation for 1000&#160;h.

Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials, and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, we propose the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; and summarize/discuss the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field. We focus on the theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating and promoting the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Thickness&#8208;Dependent Optical Properties of Conducting Nitrides and Oxides for Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Enhanced Photonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The unique properties of the emerging photonic materials, conducting nitrides and oxides, especially their tailorability, large damage thresholds, and, importantly, the so&#8208;called epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) behavior, have enabled novel photonic phenomena spanning optical circuitry, tunable metasurfaces, and nonlinear optical devices. This work explores direct control of the optical properties of polycrystalline titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO) by tailoring the film thickness, and their potential for ENZ&#8208;enhanced photonic applications. We demonstrate that TiN&#8208;AZO bilayers support Ferrell&#8208;Berreman modes utilizing the thickness&#8208;dependent epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) resonances in the AZO films operating in the telecom wavelengths spanning from 1470 to 1750&#160;nm. The bilayer stacks also act as strong light absorbers in the ultraviolet regime employing the radiative ENZ modes and the Fabry&#8208;Perot modes in the constituent TiN films. The studied Berreman resonators exhibit optically&#8208;induced reflectance modulation of 15% with picosecond response&#8208;time. Together with the optical response tailorability of conducting oxides and nitrides, utilizing the field&#8208;enhancement near the tunable ENZ regime could enable a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all&#8208;optical switching, time refraction, and high&#8208;harmonic generation.

Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional three&#8208;dimensional microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, we introduce a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max = 415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures was tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions was investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the photodegradable resist system by incorporating it into multi&#8208;material three&#8208;dimensional microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Superionic Bifunctional Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic bifunctional polymer electrolytes, in which ion relaxation is decoupled from polymer relaxation, are developed to advance electromechanical and electrochemical technologies. Through the formation of intra&#8208;monomer hydrogen bonds between two functional groups, electrostatic interactions of the polymer matrix are effectively weakened to form interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels in the glassy matrix, thereby accelerating proton transport with a low activation barrier.








Abstract
Achieving superionic conductivity from solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonated styrene) (PS&#8208;3H4S), is presented. By incorporating &#63743;OH and &#63743;SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, &#8220;intra&#8208;monomer&#8221; hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the &#63743;SO3&#8722; moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the PS&#8208;3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS&#8208;3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high storage modulus of &#8776;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and can be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n-junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier-transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single-crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n-junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single-crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n-junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built-in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high-performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Crystallization Processes and Methods in Nanocrystals, Single Crystals, and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation process is more thermodynamically difficult by involving a higher surface molecular unit ratio than the growth process of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskite (HP) crystals. Nucleation occurs under a higher supersaturation (C&#160;&gt; Cmin) while growth can occur when C is over Cs. Typical preparation methods for nucleation&#8208;dominated HP nanocrystals, growth&#8208;dominated HP single crystals, and nucleation&#8208;and&#8208;growth&#8208;balanced HP thin films are reviewed.








Abstract
Halide perovskite semiconductors with extraordinary optoelectronic properties have been fascinatedly studied. Halide perovskite nanocrystals, single crystals, and thin films have been prepared for various fields, such as light emission, light detection, and light harvesting. High&#8208;performance devices rely on high crystal quality determined by the nucleation and crystal growth process. Here, the fundamental understanding of the crystallization process driven by supersaturation of the solution is discussed and the methods for halide perovskite crystals are summarized. Supersaturation determines the proportion and the average Gibbs free energy changes for surface and volume molecular units involved in the spontaneous aggregation, which could be stable in the solution and induce homogeneous nucleation only when the solution exceeds a required minimum critical concentration (Cmin). Crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation are thermodynamically easier than homogeneous nucleation due to the existent surfaces. Nanocrystals are mainly prepared via the nucleation&#8208;dominated process by rapidly increasing the concentration over Cmin, single crystals are mainly prepared via the growth&#8208;dominated process by keeping the concentration between solubility and Cmin, while thin films are mainly prepared by compromising the nucleation and growth processes to ensure compactness and grain sizes. Typical strategies for preparing these three forms of halide perovskites are also reviewed.

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method was used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source and research hotspots are recognized. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

         <title>Chemical vapor deposition of high optical quality large area monolayer Janus transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We report one pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large area Janus SeMoS monolayers, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report one pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large area Janus SeMoS monolayers, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these two-dimensional semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic equilibrium driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principal calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto-optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton-phonon coupling and enable to obtain the exciton g-factor of -3.3.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly of a homopolymer for multi&#8208;scale materials engineering</title>

Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assembly into nano&#8208; to macro&#8208;scale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subject to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multi&#8208;scale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;bromine surface state for stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum perovskite QLEDs with an EQE of 14.6%</title>

Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, the enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realised using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots. We find that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long&#8208;chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br&#8208;rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky&#8208;blue emitting perovskite QLEDs (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd/A. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V. This strategy paves the way for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>Step&#8208;climbing Epitaxy of Layered Materials with Giant Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Lattice Mismatch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high&#8208;quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi2O2Se on three&#8208;dimensional SrTiO3 substrates as an example, we propose a step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy, in which the nth (n = 1, 2, 3&#8230;) epilayer climbs the step with height difference from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch and continues to grow the n+1th epilayer. Step&#8208;climbing epitaxy can spontaneously relax and release the strain from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, which ensures the high quality of large&#8208;area epitaxial films. Wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystal films with controllable thickness can be obtained via step&#8208;climbing epitaxy. Most notably, one&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2Se films (1.2&#160;nm thick) exhibit a high Hall mobility of 180 cm2/Vs at room temperature, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness. As an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is generally present in the epitaxy of layered materials, the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy strategy expands the existing epitaxial growth theory and provides guidance toward the high&#8208;quality synthesis of layered materials.

         <title>Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning Models &#8220;Work&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>

Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly relied on to extract physical information from materials spectroscopy. Unfortunately, it is challenging to make machine learning models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without understanding the data or causality. Here, using a benchmark band&#8208;excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset openly published by the Authors in 2017, we demonstrate and overcome common pitfalls of so&#8208;called &#8220;better,&#8221; &#8220;faster,&#8221; and &#8220;less biased&#8221; machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based discovery of electromechanical switching. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, we demonstrate how the application of linear non&#8208;temporal machine learning methods to multimodal hyperspectral data results in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing non&#8208;sensical eigenvectors and generated spectra promoting misleading interpretations. We demonstrate, through rigorous validation, a new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS using a long&#8208;short term memory (LSTM) &#946;&#8208;variational autoencoders (&#946;VAE) that is adapted to the experiments information content. By including recurrent LSTM neurons, we consider the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, we impose a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL)&#8208;divergency regularization term to the loss function. Finally, we leverage regularization scheduling of &#946; as a disentanglement metric to reduce user bias. Combining these experiment&#8208;inspired modifications enables the automated detection of various ferroelectric switching mechanisms, including a complex two&#8208;step, three&#8208;state ferroelastic switching mechanism. Ultimately, this work provides a robust machine learning methodology for the rapid discovery of electromechanically switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials spectroscopies.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA damages by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often lead to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixes the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it would lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. We designed a NO depot for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot could provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment worked in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16 tumor more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA damages by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often lead to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixes the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it would lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. We designed a NO depot for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16 tumor-bearing mice, the depot could provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment worked in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16 tumor more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.
