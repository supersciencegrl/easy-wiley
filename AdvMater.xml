         <title>Graphene&#8208;skinned Alumina fiber Fabric for Diverse Electrothermal and Electromagnetic Compatibility and Its Mass Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance, electrothermal capability, as well as electromagnetic reflectivity and transmissivity. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.








Abstract
As electronics and instrumentation grow increasingly complex, multifunctional materials are essential for simplifying designs. Electrothermal and electromagnetic functions are commonly used, typically supplied by separate materials. Integrating them into a single material can reduce components and miniaturize systems. Meanwhile, materials with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties are needed to meet diverse application requirements, from electromagnetic waves transmitting to shielding, and electric heating across a wide temperature range. Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance (1&#8211;10&#160;000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), electrothermal capability (up to &#8776;1400&#160;&#176;C), as well as electromagnetic reflectivity (&#8776;0.003 to &#8776;0.91) and transmissivity (&#8776;0.98 to &#8776;0.0001) by adjusting graphene thickness and AFF pore size. Mass production of GAFFs in various specifications is realized, enabling diverse applications. Heating&#8208;shielding&#8208;integrated device (GAFF&#8208;HS) featuring high electromagnetic reflectivity and low transmissivity, and heating&#8208;transmitting&#8208;compatible device (GAFF&#8208;HT) with low electromagnetic reflectivity and high transmissivity, are both fabricated to target distinct applications: electrothermal anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing for electromagnetic interference shielding systems and radar systems, respectively. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Switchable Gas&#8208;Humidity Difunctional Flexible Chemosensors Based on Smart Adaptable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes self&#8208;powered difunctional flexible chemosensors by using a specially designed smart adaptable ion&#8208;introduced hydrogel to address the issue of single perception function in wearable devices, which can be highly sensitive and crosstalk&#8208;free to accurately assess oxygen and humidity levels in different states, and is expected to be widely used in the fields of safety, health and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.








Abstract
The development of self&#8208;powered, flexible, and multi&#8208;function sensors is highly anticipated in wearable electronics, however, it remains a daunting challenge to identify different signals based on a single device with singular sensing material without algorithmic support. Here, a smart adaptable hydrogel is developed by co&#8208;introducing two ions with vastly different hydrophilicity for the construction of an electrochemically self&#8208;powered, flexible, and reversibly switchable difunctional chemosensor with a metal&#8208;air battery structure. The prepared hydrogel can readily switch between water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states for crosstalk&#8208;free detection of oxygen and humidity respectively, since O2 gas and water molecules can directly participate in the oxygen reduction reaction in the device and act alone as limiting reactants and catalysts to affect the reaction rate under different hydrogel states. The resulting sensor demonstrates breakthrough O2 and humidity sensing performance with sensitivities as high as 4170.5%/% and 380.2%/% RH in water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states, respectively, and ultrawide detection ranges. Thanks to these, the devices can be applied for real&#8208;time and remote monitoring of ambient oxygen, transcutaneous oxygen pressure changes, respiration, and skin moisture by combining with wireless communication technology, and therefore have important application prospects in the fields of safety, health management, and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Ionic Liquid MPII3 Elevates Electrochromic Battery Capacity to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) based electrochromic battery is developed, achieving a high areal capacity of 56&#160;396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, which is substantially higher than those of previously reported electrochromic batteries.








Abstract
Electrochromic batteries are multifunctional devices that integrate optical modulation with energy storage capabilities through electrochemical reactions. Traditional electrochromic batteries rely on solid&#8208;state thin films, but their limited material loading constrains capacity to &#8776;100&#8211;300&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, failing to meet practical demands. Herein, an electrochromic battery based on ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) is proposed, where the color&#8208;changing mechanism is based on the reversible redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722; in solution, with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium cation (MPI+) forming a complex with I3&#8722; to suppress its shuttle effect. More importantly, the resulting ionic liquid MPII3 demonstrates exceptional reaction kinetics, enabling rapid and extensive charge transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage potential of electrochromic batteries. The fabricated devices achieve a high capacity of 56396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2 at a current density of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, these MPII3 electrochromic batteries exhibit an optical modulation as high as 68.1% and excellent cycling stability, with 92.3% capacity retention after 20&#160;000 cycles. These findings represent a significant advancement and are expected to promote the practical application of electrochromic batteries in smart windows, energy&#8208;efficient buildings, and other fields.

         <title>Ultrapure Graphite from Solid Refining</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity graphite serves as a fundamental material for scientific research and technological applications. Here, an effective solid refining process is developed utilizing the nickel (Ni) atomic lattice to eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic impurities, producing ultrapure graphite. The resultant graphite exhibits the highest elemental, structural, and doping purity among all the known natural and artificial graphite, enabling its excellent transport properties.








Abstract
Graphite has sparked extensive quantum physical discoveries and demonstrated numerous cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, existing graphite typically contains considerable impurities, and effective purification is still lacking. Here, a solid refining purification method is reported for obtaining ultrapure graphite. Through this design, impurities are filtered by the atomic lattice of a solid&#8208;state nickel (Ni). Suitable absorption, diffusion, and precipitation energy barriers are utilized in this method, allowing only carbon (C) atoms to effectively migrate through the Ni lattice to form high&#8208;quality graphite. The obtained ultrapure graphite shows the lowest elemental impurity density (&lt;10 parts per million (ppm), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the best available graphite), the highest structural purity (&lt;0.2 parts per billion (ppb) of in&#8208;plane structural defect density and &gt;99% Bernal stacking), and the highest doping purity (carrier doping density &lt;2.0 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2). Such superior purity of graphite facilitates the all&#8208;integer visible Landau levels and the ultralow quantum transition magnetic field in the fabricated graphene device. This solid refinement technique should inspire the purification of various layered crystals, leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the development of advanced applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymer Monolayer Transistors with Sub&#8208;20 nm Channel Lengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies, polymer monolayer transistors with a channel length of 18 nm are demonstrated, which exhibit good operational stability and reliability with the on&#8208;state current density of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A mm&#8722;1 and the intrinsic gate delay of 0.79 ps. Moreover, the short channel effect is investigated by varying the dielectric thickness.








Abstract
The scaling strategy is widely used to achieve much improved performance and reduced cost in a single chip with more devices for field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Si and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D materials. However, the downscaling of polymer FETs with high performance has not been achieved. Here both the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies are employed, and demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polymer monolayer FET, where the shortest channel length (L) of 18&#160;nm is achieved that is comparable to the smallest technology node (&#8776;20&#160;nm) for planar Si FETs. Such short&#8208;channel FETs, with good operational stability and reliability, exhibit only slightly lower field&#8208;effect mobility than the device with micrometer&#8208;long channel, but the on&#8208;state current density reaches 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A &#181;m&#8722;1. More importantly, a high intrinsic gate delay of 0.79&#160;ps is achieved, while maintaining the on/off current ratio up to 109. Additionally, by increasing the thickness of gate dielectric a remarkable short channel effect is observed, which is in excellent agreement with natural scale length evaluated by the Scale Length Theory.

         <title>Active Hydrogen Enrichment on Cu6Sn5&#8208;type High Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 high entropy intermetallic compound achieves excellent performance for ammonia electrosynthesis, allowing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction in a wide concentration range, excellent stability, and direct production of ammonium product. The high intrinsic catalytic activity is attributed to improved H* generation, inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction, and low reaction free energy of the hydrogenation process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides a feasible strategy for green ammonia production and the treatment of nitrate pollution in wastewater. The generation of active hydrogen (H*) plays an important role in improving the selectivity, yield rate, and Faradaic efficiency of ammonia products. Here, structurally ordered nanoporous Cu6Sn5&#8208;type high entropy intermetallics (HEI) with extremely superior performance toward NO3RR is demonstrated. The optimal nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 HEI delivers a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.09 &#177; 1.15% and excellent stability of 120 h at the industrial level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2, accordingly directly converting NO3&#8210; to high&#8208;purity (NH4)2HPO4 with near&#8208;unity efficiency. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental results reveal that the ordered multi&#8208;site nature of the nanoporous HEI can simultaneously promote water dissociation, reduce the reaction&#8208;free energy of the hydrogenation process, and suppress hydrogen evolution. This work provides the design of the precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free HEI for sustainable NH3 synthesis and paves insights into the H* enrichment mechanism.

         <title>Active Organic Salts Enabling Non&#8208;Intrusive Electrolyte Presodiation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a non&#8208;intrusive electrolyte presodiation strategy is reported. Active organic salt sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, which is dissolved in the electrolyte and subsequently injected into dry cells. During cell charging, the salt undergoes anodic oxidation, releasing active Na ions to compensate for capacity loss. Meanwhile, the organic ligand (&#8208;SCN) dimerizes to form the electrolyte cosolvent NCS&#8208;SCN.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries show great promise, but their practical utilization is hindered by irreversible Na&#8208;ion loss during cell formation, resulting in initial coulombic efficiencies typically below 80%. Conventional presodiation methods, which involve solid additives in the cathode, can compromise electrode integrity and leave deteriorated residues, especially with high Na ion compensation (20%). An electrolyte presodiation approach is introduced that utilizes sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, discovered through cheminformatics and machine learning. This organic salt decomposes at 3.3&#8211;4.0&#160;V, releasing active Na ions and forming a cosolvent without damaging the electrode and the cell, as confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The method improves the initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 pouch cell from 80.8% to 95.2%, with a capacity retention of 84.5% over 400 cycles. These findings present a practical and non&#8208;intrusive way to address Na&#8208;ion deficiency challenges in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

         <title>Micromotion&#8208;Driven &#8220;Mechanical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Pharmaceutical Coupling&#8221; Bone&#8208;Guiding Membrane Modulates Stress&#8208;Concentrating Inflammation Under Diabetic Fractures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotion activates a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;pharmaceutical&#8221; system, converting mechanical energy to electrical cues that trigger Met release. These cues suppress inflammation via M1&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis enhancement, while Met blocks NF&#8208;&#954;B (reducing cytokines) and activates AMPK (promoting bone/vessel growth). In diabetic fractures, Met&#8208;PF@PPy cut inflammation, boosted vasculature, and elevated bone metrics.









Abstract
The use of piezoelectric materials to convert micromechanical energy at the fracture site into electrical signals, thereby modulating stress&#8208;concentrated inflammation, has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for diabetic fractures. However, traditional bone&#8208;guiding membranes often face challenges in diabetic fracture repair due to their passive and imprecise drug release profiles. Herein, a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibrous membrane is fabricated through electrospinning and oxidative polymerization to load metformin (Met) into a polypyrrole (PPy) coating (Met&#8208;PF@PPy), creating a &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system. In a micromotion mechanical environment, Met&#8208;PF@PPy converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, activating the electrochemical reduction of PPy and triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation through M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and simultaneously enhance osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In a diabetic mouse femoral fracture model, Met&#8208;PF@PPy significantly reduces inflammatory markers, enhances vascularization, and increases bone mineral density and bone volume fraction by over 30%.

&lt;p&gt;Micromotion activates a &#8220;mechano-electro-pharmaceutical&#8221; system, converting mechanical energy to electrical cues that trigger Met release. These cues suppress inflammation via M1-M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis enhancement, while Met blocks NF-&#954;B (reducing cytokines) and activates AMPK (promoting bone/vessel growth). In diabetic fractures, Met-PF@PPy cut inflammation, boosted vasculature, and elevated bone metrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of piezoelectric materials to convert micromechanical energy at the fracture site into electrical signals, thereby modulating stress-concentrated inflammation, has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for diabetic fractures. However, traditional bone-guiding membranes often face challenges in diabetic fracture repair due to their passive and imprecise drug release profiles. Herein, a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibrous membrane is fabricated through electrospinning and oxidative polymerization to load metformin (Met) into a polypyrrole (PPy) coating (Met-PF@PPy), creating a &#8220;mechanical-electrical-pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system. In a micromotion mechanical environment, Met-PF@PPy converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, activating the electrochemical reduction of PPy and triggering stress-responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation through M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization and simultaneously enhance osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF-&#954;B pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In a diabetic mouse femoral fracture model, Met-PF@PPy significantly reduces inflammatory markers, enhances vascularization, and increases bone mineral density and bone volume fraction by over 30%. This &#8220;force-electric-drug coupling&#8221; strategy provides an innovative approach for active regulation in diabetic fracture repair and offers a versatile platform for advancing piezoelectric materials in regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disordered Rocksalts&#160; as High&#8208;Energy and Earth&#8208;Abundant Li&#8208;Ion Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) offer a new direction in Li&#8208;ion cathode design beyond conventional Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based materials. This review highlights the design principles, synthesis strategies, and performance optimization of DRX oxides and oxyfluorides for energy&#8208;dense, sustainable batteries using Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals and tailored cation disorder.









Abstract
To address the growing demand for energy and support the shift toward transportation electrification and intermittent renewable energy, there is an urgent need for low&#8208;cost, energy&#8208;dense electrical storage. Research on Li&#8208;ion electrode materials has predominantly focused on ordered materials with well&#8208;defined lithium diffusion channels, limiting cathode design to resource&#8208;constrained Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based oxides and lower&#8208;energy polyanion compounds. Recently, disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) have demonstrated high capacity and energy density when lithium excess and/or local ordering allow statistical percolation of lithium sites through the structure. This cation disorder can be induced by high temperature synthesis or mechanochemical synthesis methods for a broad range of compositions. DRX oxides and oxyfluorides containing Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals have been prepared using various synthesis routes, including solid&#8208;state, molten&#8208;salt, and sol&#8208;gel reactions. This review outlines DRX design principles and explains the effect of synthesis conditions on cation disorder and short&#8208;range cation ordering (SRO), which determines the cycling stability and rate capability. In addition, strategies to enhance Li transport and capacity retention with Mn&#8208;rich DRX possessing partial spinel&#8208;like ordering are discussed. Finally, the review considers the optimization of carbon and electrolyte in DRX materials and addresses key challenges and opportunities for commercializing DRX cathodes.

         <title>Parallel Regulation of Charge Dynamics on Bipolar Ferroelectric Surfaces Breaks the Limits for Water Splitting Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by synergistically modulating carrier dynamics, both the separation efficiency and the quantity of electrons and holes transferred to ferroelectrics are optimized in parallel. As a result, the highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5.78% at 365 nm for overall water splitting among ferroelectric materials is achieved and reported to date.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, known for their non&#8208;inversion symmetry, show promise as photocatalysts due to their unique asymmetric charge separation, which separates hydrogen and oxygen evolution sites. However, the strong depolarized field induces a relaxed surface structure, which in turn directly leads to slow hole charge transfer dynamics, hindering their efficiency in water splitting. In this study, a fundamental breakthrough in dramatically enhancing the overall water&#8208;splitting activity is presented, through the synergistically regulating of the surface behaviors of photogenerated carriers,&#160;resulting in nearly perfect parallel dynamics and balanced amounts. By depositing atomic layers of TiO2 onto the surface of PbTiO3, surface vacancies are effectively passivated, significantly prolonging the hole lifetime from 10&#8722;6 to 10&#8722;3 s. Spatially resolved transient photovoltage spectroscopy showed that improved hole dynamics led to a 180&#176; phase shift between photogenerated electrons and holes, indicating nearly identical extraction dynamics. Notably, hole and electron concentrations increased to equivalent levels. This leads to a nearly 578&#8208;fold increment in the apparent quantum yield, resulting in significantly increased overall water&#8208;splitting rates, with a quantum yield of 5.78% at 365&#160;nm. The strategy is also effective with Al2O3 and SiO2, demonstrating its versatility across varied materials, providing&#160;a valuable method for creating high&#8208;performance ferroelectric photocatalysts.

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Pd Sub&#8208;Metallene: Intermediate State of Single Atoms and Metal Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates abundant vacancy defects on the MXene surface for anchoring neighboring metal single atoms, to construct atomically dispersed sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) on the nanoscale. Pd ADSM combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds, which makes it excellent and active in alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions and room&#8208;temperature hydrogen sensing.









Abstract
Despite the metal coordination and single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) have been extensively investigated in surface science over the past decade, their overall activity in involving multi&#8208;step reactions remains unsatisfactory owing to the metal bond and single atom being irreconcilable. Here, a stable atomically dispersed Pd sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) layer supported on the 2D MXene (Mo2TiC2) is reported, which combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds. Pd ADSM shows covalent structures along the z&#8208;coordination and highly coordinated metal bonds in the 2D direction. During the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Pd ADSM shows 7&#8208; and 112&#8208;times higher mass activity than the SAC (Pd SAC) and commercial Pt/C at the overpotential of &#8722;108 mV, respectively. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Pd&#9472;Pd interface not only makes the adsorbed water form a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded skeleton closer to the catalytic center but also reduces the energy barrier for the HER rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, the moderate adsorption energy of Pd&#9472;Pd bonds in ADSM can rapidly activate, dissociate, and desorb hydrogen molecules at room temperature, resulting in record&#8208;high hydrogen sensing performances (Response time, Recovery time, and Sensitivity for 100 ppm H2 are 4.8, 1.6 s, and 43.5%, respectively).

         <title>Enabling Targeted Zinc Growth via Interface Regulation Toward Binder Free and High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D self&#8208;assembled SiO2@SiO2/C nanorods crosslinked nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (SSA/NCF) networks are prepared by electrostatic spinning to promote the preferential deposition of (101) crystalline surfaces to obtain dense and flat zinc anodes. Uniform zinc ion transport and enhanced ion transfer kinetics are also achieved toward flexible, binder&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance APLs.








Abstract
Owing to the low redox potential, abundant nature, and widespread availability, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted extensive investigation. Nevertheless, the commercialization of the batteries is severely hindered by negative side reactions, catastrophic dendrite growth, and uneven Zn2+ diffusion. Here, 3D self&#8208;assembled necklace&#8208;like nanofibers are developed by a simple electrospinning technique, in which SiO2@SiO2/C nanospheres are sequentially aligned on interconnected nitrogen/carbon networks (SSA/NCF) to achieve binder&#8208;free, high&#8208;performance, and dendrite&#8208;free growth of APLs. The design structure combines excellent interfacial ion transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation. The protective layer of SSA/NCF paper exhibits a high affinity for Zn2+, thereby reducing the nucleation barrier of Zn2+ and ensuring a more homogeneous Zn deposit. More importantly, this multifunctional interfacial layer induces preferential crystalline (101) oriented electroplating growth and promotes oriented dense Zn deposition. Consequently, the SSA/NCF paper layer endowed the cell with remarkable cycling stability, achieving an extended cycle life of 3000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study offers novel insights into the development of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Suppressing Metal Dissolution in Multi&#8208;Grained Catalysts Through Intragrain Atomic Ordering for Stable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach room&#8208;temperature ultrasound assisted atomic ordering method using to fabricate multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanoalloys with an intermetallic Ni3Pt5 phase. The resulting catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability and activity in all operational condition of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Structural and electrochemical analyses reveal direct the role of atomic ordering in mitigating metal dissolution, ensuring long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Rational design of catalytic nanomaterials is essential for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cell catalysts. However, structural degradation and elemental dissolution during operation pose significant challenges to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the development of multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocatalysts featuring an atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase within intragrain is reported. Ultrasound&#8208;assisted synthesis facilitates atomic transposition by supplying sufficient diffusion energy along grain boundaries, enabling unprecedented phase formation. The Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts exhibit outstanding proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, with significantly reduced Ni dissolution. Under light&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.94 A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and a 421 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long&#8208;term operation. Under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the multi&#8208;grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase in stabilizing multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next&#8208;generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long&#8208;term operation.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202502894"&gt;2502894&lt;/a&gt;, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co-workers reveal a novel self-catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N-doped CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites (N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC) incorporating 3D low-tortuosity tunneling structure, self-catalytic N-Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium-ion batteries, the N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) and achieves an ultralong-lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM-on-a-chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality-by-Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post-diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM-on-a-chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality-by-Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery, fabricated by 3&#8208;D printing of living hydrogels containing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 biofilms, represents a novel class of engineered living energy materials. The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Creating Vacancy Strong Interaction to Enable Homogeneous High&#8208;Throughput Ion Transport for Efficient Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&#8722; anions, while the electron&#8208;rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

A 6.67Ah-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-B-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg &lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>

An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

         <title>Regulating Electron Distribution in Regioisomeric Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>

In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ.

&lt;p&gt;In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal-plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal-plane (Cu-SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu-SC in 0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mm yr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mm yr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti-counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu-SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>

An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Density Grain Boundaries in Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox Solid&#8208;Solution Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable OER Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

         <title>Efficient and Super&#8208;Stable 990 Nm Light&#8209;Emitting Diodes Based on Quantum Cutting Emission of Trivalent Ytterbium in Pure&#8208;Br Quasi&#8209;2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

&lt;p&gt;This work proposed an efficient Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D-LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super-stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D-LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; quasi 2D-LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the quasi 2D-LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi-channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br-based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near-infrared light-emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D-LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D-LMHPs materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Oligonucleotide Nanohybrids Designed for Precise Gene Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>

The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real-time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high-brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X-ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X-ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X-ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X-ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon-flux density-, dose-, and time-dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X-ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X-ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength Red&#8208;Shift Regulating Strategy of Carbon Dots Composites via the Effective Conjugated Domain and the Hydrogen Bonding Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses a structurally fixed conjugation molecule as a precursor. It efficiently forms carbon core states of carbon dots. This approach optimizes the control over the conjugated domain size of the carbon core. It also significantly enhances the synthetic efficiency of CDs and the tunability of the optical properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold significant potential for applications in lighting, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, regulating RTP emission wavelengths, especially shifting into the red spectral region, remains challenging due to the spin&#8208;forbidden transitions of triplet&#8208;state excitons and non&#8208;radiative decay. To address this issue, carbon dots (CDs) with different conjugated domain sizes and phosphorescent potential are designed and synthesized. The CDs are then encapsulated in polyacrylamide (PAM), resulting in multicolored RTP emission ranging from cyan to red (465&#8211;635 nm), with cyan and red phosphorescence exceeding 10 s and 2 s, respectively. The mechanism suggests that the enhanced conjugation effect leads to energy level splitting and strengthened electron coupling, which lowers the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons, ultimately causing a redshift in the phosphorescent emission wavelength. Meanwhile, the introduction of hydrogen bonding protects the excited state of the electrons, suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, and induces RTP in the CDs. These materials are applied in multi&#8208;level information encryption and time&#8208;delayed LED illumination, offering novel strategies for high&#8208;security technologies and advanced optical devices.

         <title>Gradient Doping for Stress&#8208;Relief in Vapor&#8208;deposited Perovskite Film to Achieve High&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells with a 23% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient doping strategy based on vapor deposition is proposed, which effectively reduces the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, promotes uniform crystallization, and applies pre&#8208;compressive stress to the surface of the perovskite film, thereby effectively alleviating the residual stress and achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;deposited p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present key advantages such as low cost, excellent stability, low&#8208;temperature fabrication, and compatibility with tandem architectures, positioning them as strong contenders for industrial&#8208;scale solar applications. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains lower than that of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Herein, a gradient doping strategy to alleviate the stress in vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite films is introduced. Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor&#8208;deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large&#8208;area and perovskite&#8208;textured silicon tandem solar cells.

         <title>In Situ Formation of a Bi/Mg&#8208;Based Hybrid Interphase for Highly Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer is formed on the Mg foil via an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8722;solid redox reaction. Magnesiophilic components enhance Mg ion transfer, desolvation, and nucleation kinetics, whereas magnesiophobic species confer passivation&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;resistant properties. Consequently, the smooth anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase facilitates homogeneous charge/ion distribution, promoting a highly reversible Mg plating/stripping process.








Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is a promising anode material for magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) owing to its high specific capacity, excellent safety profile, and abundant availability. However, pristine Mg anodes suffer from uneven plating/stripping and surface passivation/corrosion, limiting the safety and cycling stability of MMBs. This study introduces a Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer on Mg foil (denoted Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg) through an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid redox reaction by immersing the foil in a bismuth oxybromide suspension. The resulting interphase layer consists of magnesiophilic components (Bi metal and Bi2Mg3 alloy) and magnesiophobic species (MgO, MgBr2, and BiBr3). These components synergistically enhance the desolvation, nucleation, and deposition kinetics, mitigate side reactions, and promote uniform electric field and ion flux distributions. As a result, the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg electrodes exhibit superior Mg plating/stripping reversibility, maintaining stable performance for over 4100&#160;h in the all&#8208;phenyl complex electrolyte and 2900&#160;h in the Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte, significantly outperforming pristine Mg electrodes. Furthermore, full cells paired with Mo6S8 and S cathodes demonstrate excellent capacities, rate capabilities, and long lifespans, highlighting the exceptional electrochemical performance of the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg anode. This study offers a promising strategy for developing highly reversible Mg anodes, paving the way for practical long&#8208;cycle MMBs.

These devices based on micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.








Abstract
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self&#8208;powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction. Recently, researchers have increasingly integrated inorganic dielectric materials (IDMs) and micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures into various types of NGs (i.e., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and flexoelectric NGs). This strategy significantly enhances the electrical performance, enabling near&#8208;theoretical energy harvesting capability and precise multiple physiological information detection. However, because micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured IDMs function differently in each type of NG, numerous studies have focused on a single NG type and lack a unified perspective on their role across all types of biomechanical energy NGs. In this review, from an overall theoretical root of NGs, the performance enhancement mechanisms and effects of designs of IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures of various kinds of biomechanical energy NGs are systematically summarized. Next, advanced applications in human energy scavenging and physiological signal sensing are delved into. Finally, challenges and rational guidelines for designing future devices are discussed. This work provides researchers with in&#8208;depth insight into the development of high&#8208;performance personalized high&#8208;entropy power supplies and sensor networks via biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technologies based on IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton&#8208;Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High&#8208;Efficient and High&#8208;Contrast Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI&#8208;guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.








Abstract
Although photoluminescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time&#8208;resolved imaging (TRI)&#8208;guided PDT with long&#8208;lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI&#8208;guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long&#8208;wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep&#8208;seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostic approaches.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co&#8211;Ru Dimer Catalyst Boosts Conversion of Polysulfides toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co&#8722;Ru dimer catalyst synthesized by a confined pyrolysis strategy shows the orbital coupling effect derived from the atomic pair, which could reduce energy barrier of lithium polysulfides conversion and Li2S dissociation, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics and achieving the enhanced Li&#8722;S battery performance.








Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox reaction in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries triggers the development of highly active electrocatalysts for accelerating the polysulfides conversion kinetics. Rational design of catalysts with satisfactory active sites and high atom utilization toward multistep sulfur&#8208;based conversion is much desired but remains challenging. Here, it is shown that the well&#8208;designed Co&#8722;Ru dimer sites confined on carbon matrix could effectively manipulate the sulfur&#8208;involved conversion reactions and thus improve Li&#8722;S batteries performance. The orbital coupling of Co&#8722;Ru dimer induces the orbital regulation for the atomic pair, resulting the favored lithium polysulfides adsorption strength and lowed conversion energy barrier, as confirmed by systematic electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculation. Besides, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru from Co&#8211;Ru moiety also accelerates the Li2S dissociation reaction. Taken together, the as&#8208;constructed Co&#8211;Ru dimer sites render the Li&#8722;S battery with excellent performance, delivering energy density of 468&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 of total assembled pouch cell. This study offers a rational design of catalysts for boosting the catalytic performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

         <title>Nanoconfinement of Ammonia Borane via Hybrid&#8208;Phased Titanate Nanocrystals Enables Sustained H2 Release for Diabetic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid phased titanates are leveraged to achieve nanoconfinement of ammonia borane (AB) via a distinctive one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This approach enables sustained H2 release while mitigating the detrimental reaction between AB and hydrogen peroxide in pathological conditions. The released H2, in synergy with magnesium ions, effectively promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration in a diabetic model.









Abstract
Despite its potential in hydrogen (H2) therapy, ammonia borane (AB) has limited biomedical applications due to its uncontrolled hydrolysis rate and potential to cause cytotoxicity. Existing material&#8208;based delivery strategies focus on accelerating AB hydrolysis for H2 production, hence exacerbating these issues. A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid&#8208;phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H2 release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H2 release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H2 release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes&#8208;related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg2+) synergistically promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration.

         <title>Promoting Phase Transition in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites For High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films have a wide phase component distribution. Yu et&#160;al. show that introducing acetate anions promote the in situ phase transition from low&#8208;n to high&#8208;n phases. The enhanced phase transformation efficiency enables high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission peak of 641 nm and peak external quantum efficiency of 25.3%.








Abstract
Layered quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D)&#160;halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence. Narrowing the multi&#8208;quantum well distribution and eliminating wide&#8208;bandgap 2D phases are crucial for achieving a flat energy landscape, minimizing energy loss, and ensuring high&#8208;color&#8208;purity emission. Here, it is demonstrated that solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with broad component distributions arise from an incomplete kinetic transition from low&#8208;n (n, quantum well thickness) to high&#8208;n phases. To address this, an acetate anion treatment strategy is proposed, which induces competitive coordination between the acetate anion, the bulky spacer cation, and the inorganic layer, thereby facilitating the insertion of octahedral precursor ions and promoting phase transition. This treatment results in quasi&#8208;2D films with enhanced color purity, efficient energy transfer, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi&#8208;2D films for different emission wavelengths.

         <title>Symmetry is the Key to the Design of Reticular Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of the molecular structure of porous materials, particularly reticular framework materials such as MOFs and COFs, remains a significant challenge. Considering the symmetry of the building blocks that form the desired material, and a similarity score with existing experimentally characterized structures, helps identify promising new candidates; which can subsequently be used for further computational modeling and experimental validation.








Abstract
De novo prediction of reticular framework structures is a challenging task for chemists and materials scientists. Herein, a computational workflow that predicts a list of possible reticular frameworks based on only the connectivity and symmetry of node and linker building blocks is presented. This list is ranked based on the occurrence of topologies in known structures, thus providing a manageable number of structures that can be optimized using density functional theory, and inform future experiments. This workflow is broadly applicable, correctly predicts known reticular materials, and furthermore identifies novel unknown phases for some systems. This workflow is available online at https://rationaldesign.pythonanywhere.com/.

         <title>A Gradient Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composite via Crisscross Assembly of Aligned Hybrid Nanowires for Excellent Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites (GEMC) are fabricated by the magnetic&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;directional freezing assembly of amorphous ZrO2 layer&#8208;coated hydroxyapatite nanowires and subsequently, scalable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly with nanowires&#8217; direction crossed stacking. The enamel analog exhibits high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. Such an enamel biomimetic strategy offers guidelines for the engineering of gradient structure materials with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
Materials with excellent comprehensive mechanical properties (e.g., strength and toughness, stiffness and damping, fatigue et&#160;al.) are highly desirable for engineering applications, while it is still challenged for design. Tooth enamel is a typical biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties that originate from its multiscale and gradient structure. Some composites with enamel&#8208;like multiscale structures are successfully synthesized, but mimicking the gradient structure of tooth enamel is still difficult to realize. Here, an enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites exhibited high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. The interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic, fundamentally accounted for high mechanical performance. The gradient design strategy provides an avenue for the engineering of structural materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of a Single Chain Polymorph of a 2D Solid within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb2Te3, with a blue&#8208;shifted band gap in the short&#8208;wave infrared regime.








Abstract
The discovery and synthesis of atomically precise low&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials have led to numerous unusual structural motifs and nascent physical properties. However, access to low&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW)&#8208;bound analogs of bulk crystals is often limited by chemical considerations arising from structural factors like atomic radii, bonding or coordination, and electronegativity. Using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as confinement templates, we demonstrate the synthesis of a short&#8208;wave infrared&#8208;absorbing quasi&#8208;1D (q&#8208;1D) chain polymorph of Sb2Te3 ([Sb4Te6]n) that is structurally and electronically distinct from its 2D counterpart. It is found that the q&#8208;1D chain polymorph has both three&#8208; and five&#8208;coordinate Sb atoms covalently bonded to Te and is thermodynamically stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the encapsulated chain and the model SWCNT. The complementary experimental and computational results demonstrate the synthetic advantage of vdW nanotube confinement in the discovery of low&#8208;dimensional polytypes with drastically altered physical properties and potential applications in energy conversion processes.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Tethered Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Program Robust and Tumor&#8208;Responsive Enhancement of Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored tumor&#8208;responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.

         <title>A Durable and Highly Active Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Cells: New Insight into Segregation Suppression of Layered Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted significant attention in the field of Solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their outstanding advantages. However, there is a lack of studies on mechanism through which entropy increases in HEO oxygen electrodes affects segregation suppression. Based on PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF), a novel (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode is designed and fabricated in this work to claim the mechanism of entropy&#8208;enhanced in layered perovskite.








Abstract
One challenge to realize the commercialization of solid oxide cell technology is the instability and poor catalytic activity of the oxygen electrode during stack operation caused by Cr&#8208;containing alloy interconnect. Particularly well&#8208;known Sr/Ba&#8208;containing perovskite oxides can easily segregate Sr/Ba to the surface, reacting with vaporized Cr and causing Cr poisoning. To address this challenge, this work designs an entropy&#8208;driven layered structural strategy to suppress the surface segregation of cations and realize substantial enhancement of catalysis activity and Cr tolerance. The investigations suggest that the planar strain generated by entropy increase in the rare earth layer plays a pivotal role in suppressing alkaline earth segregation. Consequently, the half&#8208;cells with (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode exhibit significantly improved stability in various operation conditions with Cr containment. Furthermore, LPNSBSCF shows the high power density of 2.12 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.41 W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C in the single cells of oxygen ion and proton type, respectively. This paper provides new insights into segregation suppression in layered perovskite and offers theoretical guidance for the rational design of oxygen electrodes to achieve high Cr&#8208;tolerance and catalytic activity.

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Stabilized Ni&#8208;Co Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Energy Generation and Ammonia Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, scalable CO2&#8208;laser irradiation method is reported to anchor Ni and Co as dual single atoms on L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx MXene (DSAC). The resulting DSAC enables efficient NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208; NH3 conversion in a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; battery, achieving simultaneous nitrate removal, energy generation, and ammonia synthesis via a potential&#8208;resolved reaction pathway.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) hold immense potential in electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction (EcNR) as a sustainable replacement to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for the production of ammonia (NH3). However, challenges such as synthesis complexity, low purity, scalability, and stability have hindered their practical application. Herein, a rapid and scalable method is introduced to stabilize low&#8208;cost 3d transition metals (Ni and Co) as DSACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene in 10&#160;min using continuous&#8208;wave CO2&#8208;laser irradiation. Ni2+ and Co2+ ions are chelated and stabilized as single atoms onto an L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx surface via metal&#9472;O and metal&#9472;N bonds, forming Ni&#8208;single atom catalyst (SAC)/MXene, Co&#8208;SAC/MXene, and NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene. This approach enhances MXene properties, enabling the synthesis of efficient atomic&#8208;level electrocatalysts. Potential&#8208;resolved in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and density functional theory reveal that EcNR proceeds through NO3&#8722; reduction to *NO2, *NO, *NH, and *NH2 intermediates, ultimately forming NH3 via final protonation step. This process exhibits a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.37&#160;V, with *NO2 protonation identified as the critical step. NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene exhibited superior EcNR performance for NH3 production in 1.0&#160;M potassium hydroxide with sustained multiple cyclic stability. Furthermore, this catalyst is integrated into a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; a battery that simultaneously removes NO3&#8722;, generates energy, and synthesizes NH3.

         <title>Detecting Cr6+ at &#8776;100 pM Concentration with Fluorescence Enhancement Signatures in a Novel Eco&#8208;Fluorophore: Matching WHO's 96 pM Recommended Standard for Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy, carbon quantum dots (CQD) with exceptional fluorescence properties are engineered. These CQD are integrated with graphitic carbon nitride to form a 2D/2D heterostructure via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification. This integration enables ultra&#8208;trace Cr&#8310;&#8314; detection with a limit of detection &#8776;70 pM&#8212;surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cr&#8310;&#8314; sensors.








Abstract
Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr6+ over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual&#8208;functionalized CQD (CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH)) derived from coffee&#8208;waste. Additionally, the covalent and non&#8208;covalent approach integrates CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) and g&#8208;C3N4 introduces a mid&#8208;gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr6+ detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr6+ in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide&#8208;range fluorescent sensing applications.

These CQD are integrated with graphitic carbon nitride to form a 2D/2D heterostructure via both covalent and non-covalent modification. This integration enables ultra-trace Cr&#8310;&#8314; detection with a limit of detection &#8776;70 pM&#8212;surpassing state-of-the-art Cr&#8310;&#8314; sensors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexavalent chromium (Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non-covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual-functionalized CQD (CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH)) derived from coffee-waste. Additionally, the covalent and non-covalent approach integrates CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) and g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; introduces a mid-gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state-of-the-art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non-covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide-range fluorescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure&#8208;shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto&#8208;transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Retaining/Ion&#8208;Regulating Bi&#8208;Layers for Highly Durable, All&#8208;Climate, Efficient Moisture Electric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>Toward the Ideal Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst: a Noble Metal&#8208;Free Antiperovskite Optimized with A&#8208;Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is for the first time reported to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance, benefiting from the inherent metallic characteristics and unique multifunction&#8208;site synergy whereby Ni sites facilitate the H2O dissociation/OH&#8722; desorption and Cd&#8211;Ni bridge sites are active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution.








Abstract
To achieve the ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media, developing conductive systems with multiple active sites targeting every elementary step in the alkaline HER, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, a conductive noble metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is reported with intrinsic metallic characteristics as a highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, which is designed by the facile A&#8208;site tuning strategy with the modulation the electronic structures and interfacial water configurations of antiperovskites. Impressively, the HER performance of CdNNi3 antiperovskite is superior to various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble metal catalysts ever reported, and also outperforms the commercial Raney Ni catalyst when assemble as the cathode in the practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) device. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the CdNNi3 can create synergistic dual active sites for catalyzing different elementary steps of the alkaline HER; namely, the Ni site can effectively facilitate the H2O dissociation and OH&#8722; desorption, while the unusual Cd&#8211;Ni bridge site is active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution. Such multifunction&#8208;site synergy, together with inherent high electrical conductivity, enables the CdNNi3 antiperovskite to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Ultrathin Electrolyte Membranes With Reinforced Concrete Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an ultrathin solid electrolyte inspired by reinforced concrete is developed, which integrates a nanostructured ceramic conductor and crosslinked polymer chains to induce a rapid multidimensional lithium&#8208;ion transport network. The synergistic ceramic&#8208;polymer framework uniformly stabilizes the structure, enabling dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and excellent interfacial stability. The optimized unique ion migration hopping mechanism facilitates the rapid transport of lithium&#8208;ion within the electrolyte, resulting in both stable and fast charging/discharging performance.








Abstract
Realizing solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries with fast charging capability and desirable energy density remains a key challenge for emerging applications for drones and consumer electronics, which require solid electrolytes to maintain good ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity with fast reaction kinetics. Herein, an 8.4&#160;&#181;m ultrathin solid electrolyte membrane is manifested with a reinforced concrete structure and expedited ion hopping migration capability, enabling the solid&#8208;state battery with fast charging capability. The rapid multi&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transportation network is well&#8208;constructed based on nanosized ceramic conductor aggregation and polymer chain induction, which allows homogenized Li+ distribution on the interface with a continuous uniform and steady plating/stripping process, thereby enhancing interfacial stability and inhibiting dendrite growth. Attributed to its structural superiorities, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery maintains an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.2% after 1300 cycles at 10 C. A 1.2 Ah pouch cell is fabricated with a high energy density of 415.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and also capable of cycling at 5 C, showing great potential for the practical application of solid&#8208;state batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse&#8208;Inspired Bionic Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical&#8208;sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO&#8208;targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well&#8208;known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration. Taken together, this study introduces prospective concepts for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

         <title>Synchronization Strategy for Activity and Stability in Fenton&#8208;Like Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. In addition, the auxiliary role of machine learning is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. Key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in the applications of environmental remediation based on Fenton&#8208;like systems. Current research on Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis often emphasizes catalytic activity and mechanism regulation, while paying limited attention to the simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability&#8212;a critical factor for the practical and scale&#8208;up applications of SACs. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive review of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis from the perspective of concurrent optimization of activity and stability. Additionally, the auxiliary role of machine learning and lifecycle assessment (LCA) is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. By investigating the interplay among different support materials, coordination configurations, and reaction environments, as well as enlarged modules, key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.

&lt;p&gt;This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton-like single-atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. In addition, the auxiliary role of machine learning is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. Key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next-generation catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability for practical environmental remediation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in the applications of environmental remediation based on Fenton-like systems. Current research on Fenton-like single-atom catalysis often emphasizes catalytic activity and mechanism regulation, while paying limited attention to the simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability&#8212;a critical factor for the practical and scale-up applications of SACs. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton-like single-atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive review of Fenton-like single-atom catalysis from the perspective of concurrent optimization of activity and stability. Additionally, the auxiliary role of machine learning and lifecycle assessment (LCA) is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. By investigating the interplay among different support materials, coordination configurations, and reaction environments, as well as enlarged modules, key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next-generation catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability for practical environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>In Situ Polymerized Polyfluorinated Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolytes are engineered for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated groups enhance oxidative stability, improve interfacial compatibility, and promote inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation for uniform Li deposition. Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells achieve&#160;401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy, showcasing promise for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
In situ polymerized polyether electrolytes are promising for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial contact. However, their practical application is hindered by Li dendrite formation, interfacial degradation, and limited oxidative stability. Herein, we propose an in situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolyte (PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO), synthesized by copolymerizing 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5&#8208;octafluorohexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diyl)bis(oxirane) (OFHDBO) as a polyfluorinated crosslinker. The electron&#8208;withdrawing polyfluorinated groups endow PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO with enhanced oxidative stability and interfacial compatibility, while reducing the solvation power of the polymer matrix to promote an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase for uniform Li deposition. Consequently, PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO exhibits a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.6&#160;V) and enables long&#8208;term stable Li plating/stripping for over 1100&#160;h. Furthermore, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells utilizing PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO demonstrate outstanding cycling stability with high&#8208;loading cathodes (&#8776;3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m), achieving capacity retention of 95.5% and 89.1% over 100 cycles at cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively. Remarkably, Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells deliver an impressive specific energy of 401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, highlighting their potential for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Thermal Charging Cells Enabled by Ca&#8211;Li Dual&#8208;Cationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes and Anionophilic Separators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%. The dual&#8208;cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca2+ and Li+ ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&#8722;1, and an outstanding Carnot&#8208;relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service&#8208;temperature range of i&#8208;TEs, holding significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Unlocking Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Performance with Porous PtCoV Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer microenvironment is strategically engineered to alleviate the sulfonate group&#8208;induced poisoning effect on Pt active sites by encapsulating Pt&#8208;based nanoalloys within porous nanofibers. This innovative architecture significantly enhanced proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance, achieving a remarkable peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an exceptional initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported Pt&#8208;based catalysts in fuel cells often suffer from sulfonate poisoning, reducing Pt utilization and activity. Herein, a straightforward strategy is developed for synthesizing a porous PtCoV nanoalloy embedded within the porous structures of carbon nanofibers. Incorporation of vanadium (V) atoms into the PtCo alloy optimizes the oxygen binding energy of Pt sites, while heightening the dissolution energy barrier for both Pt and Co atoms, leading to a significantly enhanced intrinsic activity and durability of the catalyst. By encapsulating the nanoalloys within porous nanofibers, a non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer interface is created to mitigate the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups to Pt sites, while promoting oxygen permeation and allowing proton transfer. This rational architecture liberates additional active Pt sites, while the evolved porous nanostructure of the PtCoV alloy extends its exposed surface area, thereby boosting Pt utilization within the catalytic layer and overall fuel cell performance. The optimized catalyst demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1, which exceeds&#160;the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. This study provides a promising avenue for developing highly active and durable low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

         <title>Harnessing Spin&#8208;Lattice Interplay in Metal Nitrides for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of Mo triggers a high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin transition in Co centers, achieving efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. This spin&#8208;engineered catalytic system establishes a transformative platform for sustainable energy technologies, advancing frontier applications in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Metal nitrides, renowned for their spin&#8208;lattice&#8208;charge interplay, offer vast potential in catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion. However, spin polarization manipulation in these nitrides remains a challenge for multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic processes. This study introduces Co3Mo3N with a low&#8208;spin polarization configuration, achieved by incorporating spin&#8208;free lattice Mo with 4d orbitals into high&#8208;spin polarization Co4N. This innovation delivers outstanding nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrosynthesis, ranking among the best to date. Mo inclusion induces competing magnetic exchange interactions, reducing the spin polarization degree and enabling rate&#8208;determining step of NO2* to NO&#8208;OH* conversion via vertex&#8208;sharing NMo6 octahedra. A paired electro&#8208;refinery with a Co3Mo3N cathode achieves 2&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.28&#160;V and sustains an industrial&#8208;scale current of 1&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 2,100&#160;h, with an NH3 production rate of &#8776;70&#160;mg NH3&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a transformative platform for spin polarization degree&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, driving breakthroughs in energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Ringsf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes.

&lt;p&gt;Thermally fueled, self-moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non-equilibrium states to drive self-assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non-equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self-sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero-elastic-energy-mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single-ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Sintering Ni&#8208;W Catalytic Layer on Reductive Tungsten Carbides for Superior High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;sintering catalyst with efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) with stabilized Ni&#948;+ sites for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Here the concept of design of high&#8208;performance catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects offers a promising path to engineering superior high&#8208;temperature thermal catalysis.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction stands out as a promising approach for selectively converting CO2 into CO, which can then be upgraded into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. While designing high selectivity and stability catalysts for RWGS reaction remains a significant challenge. In this study, an efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) is designed as an anti&#8208;sintering catalyst for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Benefiting from the unique structures, the NiAWC catalyst exhibits exceptionally high performances with a CO production rate of 1.84 molCO&#160;gNi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and over 95% CO selectivity, maintaining stability for 120 h at 500&#160;&#176;C. Even after 300 h of continuous testing at 600&#160;&#176;C and five aging cycles at 800&#160;&#176;C, the activity loss is only 0.34% and 0.83%, respectively. Unlike the conventional mechanism in RWGS reaction, it is demonstrated that the Ni&#8208;W limited coordination can stabilize the Ni sites and allow a pre&#8208;oxidation of Ni&#948;+ by CO, which produces an O* electronic reservoir and hinders the charge transfer from Ni to W&#8208;O, thereby avoiding the dissolution of Ni atoms. The design of new, efficient, and selective catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects is suggested to offer a promising path to engineering superior thermal catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Patterned Delivery of Chemical Signals From 3D&#8208;Printed Picoliter Droplet Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks have been fabricated that control gene expression in bacterial populations by releasing chemical signals with precise spatial definition and high temporal resolution. This system of effector release is widely applicable, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine.









Abstract
Synthetic cells, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, can be engineered to detect and release chemical signals to control target cell behavior. However, control over target&#8208;cell populations is limited due to poor spatial or temporal resolution and the inability of synthetic cells to deliver patterned signals. Here, 3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks are described that direct gene expression in underlying bacterial populations by patterned release of a chemical signal with temporal control. Shrinkage of the droplet networks prior to use achieves spatial control over gene expression with &#8776;50 &#181;m resolution. Ways to store chemical signals in the droplet networks and to activate release at controlled points in time are also demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the spatially&#8208;controlled delivery system can regulate competition between bacteria by inducing the patterned expression of toxic bacteriocins. This system provides the groundwork for the use of picoliter droplet networks in fundamental biology and in medicine in applications that require the controlled formation of chemical gradients (i.e., for the purpose of local control of gene expression) within a target group of cells.

         <title>Zwitterionic Brush&#8208;Grafted Interfacial Bio&#8208;Lubricant Evades Complement C3&#8208;Mediated Macrophage Phagocytosis for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrophage&#8208;evading nano&#8208;lubricant is designed to enhance osteoarthritis (OA) treatment by suppressing complement C3 adsorption and subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. Through a zwitterionic PMPC brush layer, this strategy reduces inflammation, preserves joint lubrication, and prevents OA progression. This work highlights the pivotal role of complement C3 in nanoparticle clearance and offers a novel therapeutic approach for OA management.









Abstract
Administering a bio&#8208;lubricant is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, if it can both manage symptoms and halt disease progression. However, the clearance of these bio&#8208;lubricants mediated by synovial macrophages leads to reduced therapeutic efficiency and adverse inflammatory responses. Herein, it is shown that this process is predominantly mediated by the specific binding of complement C3 (on nanoparticle) and CD11b (on macrophage). More importantly, through a systematic evaluation of various interface modifications, a macrophage&#8208;evading nanoparticle strategy is proposed, which not only minimizes friction, but also largely suppresses C3 adsorption. It involves employing a zwitterionic poly&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) brush layer grafted from a crosslinked gelatin core. In vitro studies demonstrate that such a nanoparticle lubricant can evade macrophage phagocytosis and further prevent the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 polarization and subsequent harmful release of cytokines. In vivo studies show that the designed PMPC brush layer effectively mitigates synovial inflammation, alleviates OA&#8208;associated pain, and protects cartilage from degeneration, thus preventing OA progression. These findings clarify the pivotal role of complement C3&#8208;mediated macrophage recognition in nanoparticles clearance and offer a promising nanoparticle design strategy to restore joint lubrication.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <title>Monitoring &#945;/&#946; Particles Using a Copper Cluster Scintillator Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cluster scintillator with excellent stability and scintillation performance, which shows high sensitivity response to &#945;/&#946; particles, is constructed. By coupling it with PMT and nuclear electronics system, a surface contamination monitor for precise detection of &#945;/&#946; particles is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy radiation is widely used in medicine, industry, and scientific research. Meanwhile, the detection of environmental ionizing radiation is essential to ensure the safe use of high&#8208;energy radiation. Among radiation detectors, scintillator detectors offer multiple advantages, including simple structure, high sensitivity, excellent environmental adaptability, and a favorable performance&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the development of high&#8208;performance scintillators that can provide highly sensitive responses to environmental radiation, especially &#945;/&#946; particles, remains a challenge. In this work, a copper cluster (Cu4I4(DPPPy)2) with excellent water&#8208;oxygen stability is prepared using a simple one&#8208;pot method at room temperature. Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 not only exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) under X&#8208;ray irradiation but also demonstrates a highly sensitive scintillation response to &#945;/&#946; particles. By integrating Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and nuclear electronics, an &#945;/&#946; surface contamination monitor is successfully developed. This monitor enables the sensitive detection of excessive &#945;/&#946; particles in real&#8208;world environments. The detection frequency and signal intensity of Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 significantly surpass those of commercial scintillator of YAP:Ce, BGO, PbWO4, and anthracene under identical conditions, highlighting the promising application of metal clusters in low&#8208;dose environmental radiation detection.

         <title>Mechanical Resonant Sensing of Spin Texture Dynamics in a 2D Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal is achieved through nanomechanical resonators at radio frequencies. Sharp magnetic transitions that lead to abrupt changes in mechanical linear and nonlinear responses are assigned to antiferromagnetic domain motions. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field.








Abstract
The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long&#8208;range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non&#8208;collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high&#8208;speed computing devices. Here, collective spin texture dynamics is detected with nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from&#160;2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with 10&#8722;9 strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions are identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large&#8208;scale spin&#8208;dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid&#8208;like response due to ultrafast domain motion. The work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.

Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade-coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8-BO, and L8-BO-4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8-BO-4Cl and its weak molecule-interaction with toluene, the air-blade-coated D18/L8-BO-4Cl-based device yields an outstanding power-conversion efficiency of 19.31%.
