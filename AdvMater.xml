      <title>Direct Pyrolysis of Supermolecules: An Ultrahigh Edge&#8208;Nitrogen Doping Strategy of Carbon Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping strategy is presented. 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) with an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping level of 16.8 at% is prepared through a novel, general direct supermolecule pyrolysis strategy. Highly edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D&#8208;NTC shows remarkable performance toward potassium&#8208;ion storage. A high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion full battery is assembled using a 3D&#8208;NTC anode and perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode.








Abstract
Most reported carbonaceous anodes of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have limited capacities. One approach to improve the performance of carbon anodes is edge&#8208;nitrogen doping, which effectively enhances the K&#8208;ion adsorption energy. It remains challenging to achieve high edge&#8208;nitrogen doping due to the difficulty in controlling the nitrogen dopant configuration. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare carbon anodes with ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping for high&#8208;performance PIBs. Specifically, self&#8208;assembled supermolecule precursors derived from pyromellitic acid and melamine are directly pyrolyzed. During the pyrolysis process, the amidation and imidization reactions between pyromellitic acid and melamine before carbonization enable the successful carbonization of pyromellitic acid&#8211;melamine supermolecule. The obtained 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) possesses a 3D framework composed of carbon nanosheets, turbostratic crystalline structure, and an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doping level up to 16.8 at% (73.7% of total 22.8 at% nitrogen doping). These features endow 3D&#8208;NTCs with remarkable performances as PIB anodes. The 3D&#8208;NTC anode displays a high capacity of 473 mAh g&#8722;1, robust rate capability, and a long cycle life of 500 cycles with a high capacity retention of 93.1%. This new strategy will boost the development of carbon anodes for rechargeable alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;ion batteries.

     alt="Direct Pyrolysis of Supermolecules: An Ultrahigh Edge&#8208;Nitrogen Doping Strategy of Carbon Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping strategy is presented. 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) with an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping level of 16.8 at% is prepared through a novel, general direct supermolecule pyrolysis strategy. Highly edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D&#8208;NTC shows remarkable performance toward potassium&#8208;ion storage. A high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion full battery is assembled using a 3D&#8208;NTC anode and perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most reported carbonaceous anodes of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have limited capacities. One approach to improve the performance of carbon anodes is edge&#8208;nitrogen doping, which effectively enhances the K&#8208;ion adsorption energy. It remains challenging to achieve high edge&#8208;nitrogen doping due to the difficulty in controlling the nitrogen dopant configuration. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare carbon anodes with ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping for high&#8208;performance PIBs. Specifically, self&#8208;assembled supermolecule precursors derived from pyromellitic acid and melamine are directly pyrolyzed. During the pyrolysis process, the amidation and imidization reactions between pyromellitic acid and melamine before carbonization enable the successful carbonization of pyromellitic acid&#8211;melamine supermolecule. The obtained 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) possesses a 3D framework composed of carbon nanosheets, turbostratic crystalline structure, and an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doping level up to 16.8 at% (73.7% of total 22.8 at% nitrogen doping). These features endow 3D&#8208;NTCs with remarkable performances as PIB anodes. The 3D&#8208;NTC anode displays a high capacity of 473 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, robust rate capability, and a long cycle life of 500 cycles with a high capacity retention of 93.1%. This new strategy will boost the development of carbon anodes for rechargeable alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributions of Different Functional Groups to Contact Electrification of Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of polymer films with different functional groups on the side chain are employed for clarifying the contribution of functional groups to their contact electrification (CE) processes with both solids and liquids. The unsaturated groups of PTFE can enhance the electronegativity of the whole functional group.








Abstract
Polymers are commonly used to fabricate triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Here, several polymer films with similar main chains but different functional groups on the side chain are employed to clarify the contributions of each functional group to contact electrification (CE). The results show that the electron&#8208;withdrawing (EW) ability and density of these functional groups on the main chain can determine both the polarity and density of CE&#8208;induced surface charges. Similar results are obtained for CE in both the polymer&#8211;polymer and polymer&#8211;liquid modes. A theoretical mechanism involving electron cloud overlap is proposed to explain all of these results. More importantly, the unsaturated groups on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) molecular chain are proved to have a much stronger EW ability than the saturated groups. The density of these unsaturated groups can be increased using a sputtering technique, suggesting that this is a facile and effective method of enhancing the performance of TENGs. These results clarify the correlation between the molecular structure and macroscopic electrification behavior of polymers.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne Ion Tunnels Directing Concentration Redistribution for Commercial&#8208;Grade Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries suffering from the dendrite issue show a short lifespan, especially at commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass. Hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne with ion tunnels is employed to eliminate dendrites, based on ion redistribution, achieving a long lifespan of 10 000 cycles at a cathode loading mass of 22.95 mg cm&#8722;2. This work sheds light on tackling the dendrite issue encountered by metal batteries.








Abstract
Current aqueous Zn batteries (ZBs) seriously suffer from dendrite issues caused by rough electrode surfaces. Despite significant efforts in prolonging lifespan of these batteries, little effort has been devoted to dendrite elimination in commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass. Instead, demonstrations have only been done at the laboratory level (&#8804;2 mg cm&#8722;2). Additionally, new dilemmas regarding change of the proton&#8208;storage behavior and interface pulverization have emerged in turn. Herein, hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), with sub&#8208;&#229;ngstr&#246;m level ion tunnels and robust chemical stability, is designed as an artificial interface layer to address these issues. This strategy prolongs the symmetric cell lifespan to &gt;2400 h (100 days), which is 37 times larger than without protection (63 h). The simulation of dual fields reveals that HsGDY can redistribute the Zn2+ concentration field by spatially forcing Zn2+ to deviate from the irregular electric field. During practical use, the as&#8208;assembled full batteries deliver a long lifespan 50 000 cycles and remain stable even at a commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass of up to 22.95 mg cm&#8722;2. This HsGDY&#8208;protection methodology represents great progress in Zn dendrite protection and demonstrates enormous potential in metal batteries.

      <title>Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic Janus microspheres are designed from Pickering emulsions. A regular array of dimples is prepared on the surface of the microspheres using an array of particles at the emulsion interface as templates, on which plasmonic nanostructures are created by directional deposition of metal. This class of plasmonic microgranules with a controlled plasmonic property will provide new opportunities for various optical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanostructures have been created in a film format to develop unique plasmonic properties. Here, well&#8208;defined metal nanostructures are designed on the surface of microspheres to provide plasmonic microgranules. As conventional techniques are inadequate for nanofabrication on spherical surfaces, photocurable emulsion drops with a regular array of silica particles are employed at the interface to create periodic nanostructures. The silica particles, originating from the dispersed phase, fully cover the interface by forming a non&#8208;close&#8208;packed hexagonal array after drop generation, and slowly protrude to the continuous phase during aging while their interparticle separation decreases. Therefore, hexagonal arrays of spherical dimples with controlled geometry and separation are created on the surface of microspheres by photocuring the drops and removing the particles. Directional deposition of either aluminum or gold results in a continuous film with a hexagonal array of holes on the outermost surface and isolated curved disks in dimples, which renders the hemisphere of microspheres plasmonically colored. The resonant wavelength is controlled by adjusting the aging time, metal thickness, and size of silica particles, providing various plasmonic colors. This granular format of the plasmonic Janus microspheres will open a new avenue of optical applications including active color pixels, optical barcodes, and microsensors.

      <title>Hybrid Magnetic Micropillar Arrays for Programmable Actuation</title>
      <dc:description>
A new experimental technique for hybrid magnetic micropillar arrays is developed to realize site&#8208;specific, on&#8208;demand, and programmed bending actuation. Several exciting applications for surface engineering and micromanipulations, including encryptable surface printing/stamping, direction&#8208; and track&#8208;programmable microtransport, and magnetic micro&#8208;tweezers that can smartly grip and release microscale objects, are demonstrated using the micropillar arrays.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive micro/nanostructures that can dynamically and reversibly adapt their configurations according to external stimuli have stimulated a wide scope of engineering applications, ranging from material surface engineering to micromanipulations. However, it remains a challenge to achieve a precise local control of the actuation to realize applications that require heterogeneous and on&#8208;demand responses. Here, a new experimental technique is developed for large arrays of hybrid magnetic micropillars and achieve precise local control of actuation using a simple magnetic field. By manipulating the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles within individual elastomer micropillars, a wide range of the magnetomechanical responses from less than 5% to &#8776;50% for the ratio of the bending deflection to the original length of the pillars is realized. It is demonstrated that the micropillars with different degrees of bending deformation can be configured in any spatial pattern using a photomask&#8208;assisted template&#8208;casting technique to achieve heterogeneous, site&#8208;specific, and programmed bending actuations. This unprecedented local control of the micropillars offers exciting novel applications, as demonstrated here in encryptable surface printing and stamping, direction&#8208; and track&#8208;programmable microparticle/droplet transport, and smart magnetic micro&#8208;tweezers. The hybrid magnetic micropillars reported here provide a versatile prototype for heterogeneous and on&#8208;demand actuation using programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive micro/nanostructures.

      <title>Synergistic Cascade Carrier Extraction via Dual Interfacial Positioning of Ambipolar Black Phosphorene for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambipolar black phosphorene (BP) nanosheets with the tailored thicknesses concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both the electron&#8208;transport layer/perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer/perovskite interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the appealing implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional carrier&#8208;transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.








Abstract
2D black phosphorene (BP) carries a stellar set of physical properties such as conveniently tunable bandgap and extremely high ambipolar carrier mobility for optoelectronic devices. Herein, the judicious design and positioning of BP with tailored thickness as dual&#8208;functional nanomaterials to concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells is reported. The synergy of favorable band energy alignment and concerted cascade interfacial carrier extraction, rendered by concurrent positioning of BP, delivered a progressively enhanced power conversion efficiency of 19.83% from 16.95% (BP&#8208;free). Investigation into interfacial engineering further reveals enhanced light absorption and reduced trap density for improved photovoltaic performance with BP incorporation. This work demonstrates the appealing characteristic of rational implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.

&lt;p&gt;2D black phosphorene (BP) carries a stellar set of physical properties such as conveniently tunable bandgap and extremely high ambipolar carrier mobility for optoelectronic devices. Herein, the judicious design and positioning of BP with tailored thickness as dual&#8208;functional nanomaterials to concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells is reported. The synergy of favorable band energy alignment and concerted cascade interfacial carrier extraction, rendered by concurrent positioning of BP, delivered a progressively enhanced power conversion efficiency of 19.83% from 16.95% (BP&#8208;free). Investigation into interfacial engineering further reveals enhanced light absorption and reduced trap density for improved photovoltaic performance with BP incorporation. This work demonstrates the appealing characteristic of rational implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Situ Formation of Oxygen Vacancies Achieving Near&#8208;Complete Charge Separation in Planar BiVO4 Photoanodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new sulfur oxidation process is developed to synthesize planar BiVO4 thin films with in situ formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film, achieving a record charge separation efficiency of 98.2%. By depositing an efficient NiFeOx oxygen evolution cocatalyst, a high and stable photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm&#8722;2 for photoelectrochemical water splitting is achieved.








Abstract
Despite a suitable bandgap of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) for visible light absorption, most of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 photoanodes are vanished before reaching the surfaces for oxygen evolution reaction due to the poor charge separation efficiency in the bulk. Herein, a new sulfur oxidation strategy is developed to prepare planar BiVO4 photoanodes with in situ formed oxygen vacancies, which increases the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to a record charge separation efficiency of 98.2% among the reported BiVO4 photoanodes. Upon loading NiFeOx as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, a stable photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination. Remarkably, a dual&#8208;photoanode configuration further enhances the photocurrent density up to 6.24 mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an excellent applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.76%. This work demonstrates a simple thermal treatment approach to generate oxygen vacancies for the design of efficient planar photoanodes for solar hydrogen production.

      <title>Thermal Management Enables Bright and Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Several thermal management strategies are proposed and applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), resulting in greatly reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off, record high radiance, and significantly improved operational lifetime. Furthermore, these thermal management strategies enable pulsed operation of perovskite LEDs in the kA cm&#8208;2 range with much improved device performance, an important step toward electrically driven perovskite lasers.








Abstract
The performance of lead&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) has increased rapidly in recent years. However, most reports feature devices operated at relatively small current densities (&lt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) with moderate radiance (&lt;400 W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2). Here, Joule heating and inefficient thermal dissipation are shown to be major obstacles toward high radiance and long lifetime. Several thermal management strategies are proposed in this work, such as doping charge&#8208;transport layers, optimizing device geometry, and attaching heat spreaders and sinks. Combining these strategies, high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs are demonstrated with maximum radiance of 2555 W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2, peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17%, considerably reduced EQE roll&#8208;off (EQE &gt; 10% to current densities as high as 2000 mA cm&#8722;2), and tenfold increase in operational lifetime (when driven at 100 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, with proper thermal management, a maximum current density of 2.5 kA cm&#8722;2 and an EQE of &#8776;1% at 1 kA cm&#8722;2 are shown using electrical pulses, which represents an important milestone toward electrically driven perovskite lasers.

      <title>Weighted Mobility</title>
      <dc:description>
The weighted mobility, easily computed from measurements of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, is an accurate measure of the charge carrier mobility and effective mass. It is even more sensitive than measurements of the Hall effect for revealing electron transport mechanisms in complex materials ranging from metals, semiconductors, and conducting polymers.








Abstract
Engineering semiconductor devices requires an understanding of charge carrier mobility. Typically, mobilities are estimated using Hall effect and electrical resistivity meausrements, which are are routinely performed at room temperature and below, in materials with mobilities greater than 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. With the availability of combined Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity measurement systems, it is now easy to measure the weighted mobility (electron mobility weighted by the density of electronic states). A simple method to calculate the weighted mobility from Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity measurements is introduced, which gives good results at room temperature and above, and for mobilities as low as 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1,

      <title>A Self&#8208;Cleaning Heterostructured Membrane for Efficient Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation with Stable Flux</title>
      <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven self&#8208;cleaning 2D heterojunction membrane for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion separation with stable flux is introduced. The 2D heterostructure membranes are successfully fabricated via a self&#8208;assembly method. The prepared membranes have a high permeation flux for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion separation and they exhibit a high&#8208;flux, stable flow rate after multiple cycles, and excellent self&#8208;cleaning properties for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.








Abstract
Lack of clean water is a major global challenge. Membrane separation technology is an ideal choice for the treatment of industrial, domestic sewage owing to its low energy consumption and cost. However, membranes are highly susceptible to contamination, particularly during wastewater treatment, which has limited their practical applications in this field. Similarly, the flux of the membrane decreases with prolonged use due to its reduced interlayer spacing. Preparation of membranes with anticontamination properties and stable flux is the key to addressing this problem. In this study, a 2D heterostructure membrane with visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven self&#8208;cleaning performance is prepared via a self&#8208;assembly process. Notably, the addition of palygorskite increases the interlayer spacing of the graphene and heterojunction structures, which increases the flux of the membrane and avoids a decrease of the interlayer spacing of the membrane under pressure. The presence of a heterojunction with visible light catalytic properties effectively avoids membrane fouling and avoids a sharp decrease of the permeation flux. Importantly, the prepared 2D membrane has excellent separation performance for oil&#8211;water emulsions with both high flux and efficiency. These features suggest great potential for the prepared 2D membrane in wastewater treatment applications.

      <title>Ultrabroadband Photodetectors up to 10.6 &#181;m Based on 2D Fe3O4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel nonlayered 2D Fe3O4 nanosheets with cubic inverse&#8208;spinel structure perform an ultrabroadband photoresponse from ultraviolet to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) range. The distinguished LWIR detection performance with ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 561.2 A W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 6.6 &#215; 103%, and detectivity of 7.42 &#215; 108 Jones can be attributed to synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect.








Abstract
The ultrabroadband spectrum detection from ultraviolet (UV) to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) is promising for diversified optoelectronic applications of imaging, sensing, and communication. However, the current LWIR&#8208;detecting devices suffer from low photoresponsivity, high cost, and cryogenic environment. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ultrabroadband photodetector is demonstrated with detecting range from UV to LWIR based on air&#8208;stable nonlayered ultrathin Fe3O4 nanosheets synthesized via a space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Ultrahigh photoresponsivity (R) of 561.2 A W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6 &#215; 103%, and detectivity (D*) of 7.42 &#215; 108 Jones are achieved at the wavelength of 10.6 &#181;m. The multimechanism synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect demonstrates the high sensitivity for light with any light intensities. The outstanding device performance and complementary mixing photoresponse mechanisms open up new potential applications of nonlayered 2D materials for future infrared optoelectronic devices.

     alt="Ultrabroadband Photodetectors up to 10.6 &#181;m Based on 2D Fe3O4 Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel nonlayered 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with cubic inverse&#8208;spinel structure perform an ultrabroadband photoresponse from ultraviolet to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) range. The distinguished LWIR detection performance with ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 561.2 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency of 6.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;%, and detectivity of 7.42 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones can be attributed to synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultrabroadband spectrum detection from ultraviolet (UV) to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) is promising for diversified optoelectronic applications of imaging, sensing, and communication. However, the current LWIR&#8208;detecting devices suffer from low photoresponsivity, high cost, and cryogenic environment. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ultrabroadband photodetector is demonstrated with detecting range from UV to LWIR based on air&#8208;stable nonlayered ultrathin Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets synthesized via a space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Ultrahigh photoresponsivity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of 561.2 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;%, and detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;*) of 7.42 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones are achieved at the wavelength of 10.6 &#181;m. The multimechanism synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect demonstrates the high sensitivity for light with any light intensities. The outstanding device performance and complementary mixing photoresponse mechanisms open up new potential applications of nonlayered 2D materials for future infrared optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Negatively Charged Nanosheets Significantly Enhance the Energy&#8208;Storage Capability of Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
A general strategy is developed to enhance energy storage of nanocomposites. Through inserting negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets into a polymer matrix, a reversed local electric field is generated and further blocks the breakdown path. A record&#8208;high energy storage of 36.2 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved in poly(vinylidene fluoride). The strategy is also utilized in polystyrene&#8208;based nanocomposites and is verified by phase&#8208;field simulations.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectric materials play a key role in advanced electronic devices and electric power systems. Although extensive research has been devoted to improve their energy&#8208;storage performances, it is a great challenge to increase the breakdown strength of polymer nanocomposites in terms of achieving high energy density and good reliability under high voltages. Here, a general strategy is proposed to significantly improve their breakdown strength and energy storage by adding negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets. A dramatically enhanced breakdown strength (792 MV m&#8722;1) and the highest energy density (36.2 J cm&#8722;3) among all flexible polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are observed in poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;based nanocomposite capacitors. The strategy generalizability is verified by the similar substantial enhancements of breakdown strength and energy density in polystyrene&#8208;based nanocomposites. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the further enhanced breakdown strength is ascribed to the local electric field, produced by the negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets sandwiched with the positively charged polyethyleneimine, which suppresses the secondary impact&#8208;ionized electrons and blocks the breakdown path in nanocomposites. The results demonstrate a new horizon of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible capacitors.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Palladium Diselenide with Strong In&#8208;Plane Optical Anisotropy and High Mobility Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly anisotropic pentagonal 2D PdSe2 is synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method, exhibiting a high electron mobility up to &#8776;294 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) palladium diselenide (PdSe2) has strong interlayer coupling and a puckered pentagonal structure, leading to remarkable layer&#8208;dependent electronic structures and highly anisotropic in&#8208;plane optical and electronic properties. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, 2D PdSe2 crystals grown by bottom&#8208;up approaches limits the study of their exotic properties and practical applications. In this work, chemical vapor deposition growth of highly crystalline few&#8208;layer (&#8805;2 layers) PdSe2 crystals on various substrates is reported. The high quality of the PdSe2 crystals is confirmed by low&#8208;frequency Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electrical characterization. In addition, strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy is demonstrated via polarized Raman spectroscopy and second&#8208;harmonic generation maps of the PdSe2 flakes. A theoretical model based on kinetic Wulff construction theory and density functional theory calculations is developed and described the observed evolution of &#8220;square&#8208;like&#8221; shaped PdSe2 crystals into rhombus due to the higher nucleation barriers for stable attachment on the (1,1) and (1,&#8722;1) edges, which results in their slower growth rates. Few&#8208;layer PdSe2 field&#8208;effect transistors reveal tunable ambipolar charge carrier conduction with an electron mobility up to &#8776;294 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is comparable to that of exfoliated PdSe2, indicating the promise of this anisotropic 2D material for electronics.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles Induce Pyroptosis in Cells Controlled by the Extracellular pH</title>
      <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles facilitate iron release in cells upon slight acidification of the extracellular pH. This process triggers pyroptosis, a cell death involving the immune system. These hybrid nanoparticles may allow the study of pyroptosis. Since extracellular acidification transforms nontoxic nanoparticles into cytotoxic drugs that induce cell death and stimulate an immune response, they may also be used for immunotherapy.








Abstract
Ion homeostasis is essential for cellular survival, and elevated concentrations of specific ions are used to start distinct forms of programmed cell death. However, investigating the influence of certain ions on cells in a controlled way has been hampered due to the tight regulation of ion import by cells. Here, it is shown that lipid&#8208;coated iron&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles are able to deliver and release high amounts of iron ions into cells. While high concentrations of iron often trigger ferroptosis, here, the released iron induces pyroptosis, a form of cell death involving the immune system. The iron release occurs only in slightly acidic extracellular environments restricting cell death to cells in acidic microenvironments and allowing for external control. The release mechanism is based on endocytosis facilitated by the lipid&#8208;coating followed by degradation of the nanoparticle in the lysosome via cysteine&#8208;mediated reduction, which is enhanced in slightly acidic extracellular environment. Thus, a new functionality of hybrid nanoparticles is demonstrated, which uses their nanoarchitecture to facilitate controlled ion delivery into cells. Based on the selectivity for acidic microenvironments, the described nanoparticles may also be used for immunotherapy: the nanoparticles may directly affect the primary tumor and the induced pyroptosis activates the immune system.

      <title>Immunotherapy: Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles Induce Pyroptosis in Cells Controlled by the Extracellular pH (Adv. Mater. 19/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1907267, Stefan Wuttke, Hanna Engelke, and co&#8208;workers describe how lipid&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles are taken up by cells via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the MOF nanoparticles are degraded depending on the extracellular pH. The degradation product leads to pyroptosis&#8212;a programmed cell death involving the immune system, in which the cell membrane is perforated with pores leading to cell lysis. Ultimately, the nanoparticles may be used for immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019072671907267&lt;/a&gt;, Stefan Wuttke, Hanna Engelke, and co&#8208;workers describe how lipid&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles are taken up by cells via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the MOF nanoparticles are degraded depending on the extracellular pH. The degradation product leads to pyroptosis&#8212;a programmed cell death involving the immune system, in which the cell membrane is perforated with pores leading to cell lysis. Ultimately, the nanoparticles may be used for immunotherapy.

      <title>Defect Engineering for Fuel&#8208;Cell Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest advances in the development of fuel&#8208;cell electrocatalysts by defect engineering are systematically introduced. Such defects modulate electronic structure and improve electrical conductivity, consequently enhancing the activities of electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells and direct methanol/formic acid fuel cells, is hampered by their poor stability, high cost, fuel crossover, and the sluggish kinetics of platinum (Pt) and Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for both the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) or small molecule oxidation reaction (SMOR). Thus far, the exploitation of active and stable electrocatalysts has been the most promising strategy to improve the performance of fuel cells. Accordingly, increasing attention is being devoted to modulating the surface/interface electronic structure of electrocatalysts and optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediate species by defect engineering to enhance their catalytic performance. Defect engineering is introduced in terms of defect definition, classification, characterization, construction, and understanding. Subsequently, the latest advances in defective electrocatalysts for ORR and HOR/SMOR in fuel cells are scientifically and systematically summarized. Furthermore, the structure&#8211;activity relationships between defect engineering and electrocatalytic ability are further illustrated by coupling experimental results and theoretical calculations. With a deeper understanding of these complex relationships, the integration of defective electrocatalysts into single fuel&#8208;cell systems is also discussed. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of defective electrocatalysts are further proposed, covering controllable preparation, in situ characterization, and commercial applications.

      <title>What Happens during Thermal Post&#8208;Treatment of Powder Aerosol Deposited Functional Ceramic Films? Explanations Based on an Experiment&#8208;Enhanced Literature Survey</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermal annealing behavior of various powder aerosol deposited (PAD) functional films with different dominating electrical charge carriers is surveyed. While PAD features the formation of dense ceramic films at room temperature, a moderate thermal treatment is found necessary to regain bulk&#8208;like conductivity values. A quantitative recommendation for the lowest possible film annealing temperatures is presented.








Abstract
Powder aerosol deposition (PAD) is a unique ceramic spray coating method that produces dense and well&#8208;adhering thick&#8208;films directly at room temperature, without requiring any heating or sintering. After the successful film formation, mechanical film properties like hardness or plasma resistance are remarkably good. However, when it comes to electrical properties like permittivity or electrical conductivity, the nanocrystalline structure of PAD films combined with high internal strains deteriorates partly the characteristic properties. The electrical conductivity may already be present within the as&#8208;deposited films. However, it is mostly lowered by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, a thermal post&#8208;deposition annealing is oftentimes required. In this work, electrically conducting films produced by powder aerosol deposition are surveyed based on published data. Their microstructural and electrical behavior during the post&#8208;deposition annealing treatment is summarized and reasons for the lowered electrical conductivity are identified. Additionally, the processes taking place during annealing, which eventually allow to regain bulk&#8208;like functional properties, are examined. A universal annealing behavior is found that leads to a quantitative recommendation for the suitable film annealing temperatures to regain the electrical conductivities.

      <title>Colossal Granular Lithium Deposits Enabled by the Grain&#8208;Coarsening Effect for High&#8208;Efficiency Lithium Metal Full Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A grain&#8208;coarsening behavior of lithium deposits with oriented columnar morphology can be realized in a solubilizer&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte. Nanowave&#8208;structured solid electrolyte interphases derived from the Sn2+&#8211;NO3&#8211; coordination&#8208;solvation structure promote a significant improvement in the lifespan (200 cycles) of Li/NMC811 full batteries (45 &#181;m thin Li anode and 16.7 mg cm&#8722;2 NMC811 cathode).








Abstract
The low Coulombic efficiency of the lithium metal anode is recognized as the real bottleneck to practical high&#8208;efficiency lithium metal batteries with limited Li excess. The grain size and microstructure of deposited lithium strongly influences the lithium plating/stripping efficiency. Here, a solubilizer&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte that can realize grain coarsening of lithium deposits (&gt;20 &#181;m in width) with oriented columnar morphology, which is in sharp contrast with conventional nanoscale dendrite&#8208;like lithium deposits in carbonate electrolytes, is reported. It exhibits improved Li Coulombic efficiency to 98.14% at a high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 150 cycles, because the colossal lithium deposition with minimal tortuosity can maintain the bulk Li with continuous electron conducting pathway during the stripping process, thus enabling efficient Li utilization. Li/NMC811 full batteries, composed of thin Li anode (45 &#181;m) and a high&#8208;capacity NMC811 cathode (16.7 mg cm&#8722;2), can achieve at least 12 times longer lifespan (200 cycles).

      <title>A Chemically Stable Hofmann&#8208;Type Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Sandwich&#8208;Like Binding Sites for Benchmark Acetylene Capture</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemically stable Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8722;organic framework is realized for benchmark acetylene capture capacity and separation, mainly attributed to the unique sandwich&#8208;like binding environments constructed by the oppositely adjacent open metal centers and cyanide groups from the two different [Ni(CN)4]2&#8722; building units, thus affording a record&#8208;high acetylene uptake at 0.01 bar and very high selectivities for acetylene&#8208;related separation applications.








Abstract
The realization of porous materials for highly selective separation of acetylene (C2H2) from various other gases (e.g., carbon dioxide and ethylene) by adsorption is of prime importance but challenging in the petrochemical industry. Herein, a chemically stable Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF), Co(pyz)[Ni(CN)4] (termed as ZJU&#8208;74a), that features sandwich&#8208;like binding sites for benchmark C2H2 capture and separation is reported. Gas sorption isotherms reveal that ZJU&#8208;74a exhibits by far the record C2H2 capture capacity (49 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01 bar and 296 K) and thus ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (36.5), C2H2/C2H4 (24.2), and C2H2/CH4 (1312.9) separation at ambient conditions, respectively, of which the C2H2/CO2 selectivity is the highest among all the robust MOFs reported so far. Theoretical calculations indicate that the oppositely adjacent nickel(II) centers together with cyanide groups from different layers in ZJU&#8208;74a can construct a sandwich&#8208;type adsorption site to offer dually strong and cooperative interactions for the C2H2 molecule, thus leading to its ultrahigh C2H2 capture capacity and selectivities. The exceptional separation performance of ZJU&#8208;74a is confirmed by both simulated and experimental breakthrough curves for 50/50 (v/v) C2H2/CO2, 1/99 C2H2/C2H4, and 50/50 C2H2/CH4 mixtures under ambient conditions.

      <title>Morphogenesis Guided by 3D Patterning of Growth Factors in Biological Matrices</title>
      <dc:description>
A two&#8208;photon patterning (2PP) method introduces enzymatic couplings, nonfouling hydrophilic photocages, and improved protein functionalization reagents, which together enable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) patterning of sensitive growth factors in complex mammalian matrices. One&#8208;step procedures are possible, as well time&#8208;controlled growth factor presentation in native matrices and low&#8208;background 2PP. These developments lead to the first demonstration of morphogenesis guided by 3D&#8208;patterned growth factors.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) control over the placement of bioactive cues is fundamental to understand cell guidance and develop engineered tissues. Two&#8208;photon patterning (2PP) provides such placement at micro&#8208; to millimeter scale, but nonspecific interactions between proteins and functionalized extracellular matrices (ECMs) restrict its use. Here, a 2PP system based on nonfouling hydrophilic photocages and Sortase A (SA)&#8208;based enzymatic coupling is presented, which offers unprecedented orthogonality and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in both inert hydrogels and complex mammalian matrices. Improved photocaged peptide synthesis and protein functionalization protocols with broad applicability are introduced. Importantly, the method enables 2PP in a single step in the presence of fragile biomolecules and cells, and is compatible with time&#8208;controlled growth factor presentation. As a corollary, the guidance of axons through 3D&#8208;patterned nerve growth factor (NGF) within brain&#8208;mimetic ECMs is demonstrated. The approach allows for the interrogation of the role of complex signaling molecules in 3D matrices, thus helping to better understand biological guidance in tissue development and regeneration.

      <title>A Nitric Oxide (NO) Nanoreporter for Noninvasive Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Macrophage Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A nitric oxide nanoreporter (NO&#8208;NR) is reported that enables non&#8208;invasive imaging of macrophage immunotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the NO&#8208;NR system, which co&#8208;delivers an inhibitor and an imaging agent, leads to enhanced efficacy and a better imaging signal. These studies demonstrate that the NO nanoreporter tool can be used as an activatable imaging agent to monitor macrophage immunotherapy response in real time.








Abstract
Macrophage&#8208;centered therapeutic approaches that rely on immune modulation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) from a pro&#8208;tumorigenic phenotype (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumorigenic phenotype (M1) have facilitated a paradigm shift in macrophage immunotherapy. However, limited clinical success has been achieved due to the low response rates observed in different types of cancers. The ability to measure immune response in real time is critical in order to differentiate responders from non&#8208;responders; however, there are currently no platforms to monitor real&#8208;time macrophage immunotherapy response. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop imaging techniques that can longitudinally monitor macrophage immunotherapy response. Nitric oxide (NO) produced as a result of activation of macrophages to an anti&#8208;tumorigenic state is considered as a hallmark of M1 and can be a direct indication of response. In this study, a NO nanoreporter (NO&#8208;NR) is reported that enables real&#8208;time monitoring of macrophage immunotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it is observed that sustained inhibition of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) using a CSF1R inhibitor&#8211;NO&#8208;NR system leads to enhanced efficacy and better imaging signal. In conclusion, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind NO nanoreporter tool is reported that can be used as an activatable imaging agent to monitor macrophage immunotherapy response in real time.

      <title>A Wearable Supercapacitor Based on Conductive PEDOT:PSS&#8208;Coated Cloth and a Sweat Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
To power devices on smart textiles and wearable systems, a textile&#8208;based supercapacitor using sweat as an electrolyte is presented. In comparison with traditional toxic electrolytes, the sweat electrolyte is safe for wearables. The supercapacitor uses poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) as the active electrode and the observed energy and power densities with sweat are 0.095 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 3.81 W kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
A sweat&#8208;based flexible supercapacitor (SC) for self&#8208;powered smart textiles and wearable systems is presented. The developed SC uses sweat as the electrolyte and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the active electrode. With PEDOT:PSS coated onto cellulose/polyester cloth, the SC shows specific capacitance of 8.94 F g&#8722;1 (10 mF cm&#8722;2) at 1 mV s&#8722;1. With artificial sweat, the energy and power densities of the SC are 1.36 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W kg&#8722;1, respectively for 1.31 V and its specific capacitance is 5.65 F g&#8722;1. With real human sweat the observed energy and power densities are 0.25 Wh kg&#8722;1, and 30.62 W kg&#8722;1, respectively. The SC performance is evaluated with different volumes of sweat (20, 50, and 100 &#181;L), bending radii (10, 15, 20 mm), charging/discharging stability (4000 cycles), and washability. With successful on&#8208;body testing, the first demonstration of the suitability of a sweat&#8208;based SC for self&#8208;powered cloth&#8208;based sensors to monitor sweat salinity is presented. With attractive performance and the use of body fluids, the presented approach is a safe and sustainable route to meet the power requirements in wearable systems.

The developed SC uses sweat as the electrolyte and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the active electrode. With PEDOT:PSS coated onto cellulose/polyester cloth, the SC shows specific capacitance of 8.94 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (10 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1 mV s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With artificial sweat, the energy and power densities of the SC are 1.36 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 329.70 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively for 1.31 V and its specific capacitance is 5.65 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With real human sweat the observed energy and power densities are 0.25 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 30.62 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The SC performance is evaluated with different volumes of sweat (20, 50, and 100 &#181;L), bending radii (10, 15, 20 mm), charging/discharging stability (4000 cycles), and washability. With successful on&#8208;body testing, the first demonstration of the suitability of a sweat&#8208;based SC for self&#8208;powered cloth&#8208;based sensors to monitor sweat salinity is presented. With attractive performance and the use of body fluids, the presented approach is a safe and sustainable route to meet the power requirements in wearable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asymmetric Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Efficiency and Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
Asymmetric electron acceptors by combining halogenated indandione and 3&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;1&#8208;indanone as two different conjugated terminals are designed and synthesized. Such design enables reduced energy loss and boosted charge separation, thus leading to 16.37% binary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and 17.43% ternary OPVs, which are among the best efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OPVs.








Abstract
Low energy loss and efficient charge separation under small driving forces are the prerequisites for realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, a new molecular design of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed to address above two issues simultaneously by introducing asymmetric terminals. Two NFAs, BTP&#8208;S1 and BTP&#8208;S2, are constructed by introducing halogenated indandione (A1) and 3&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;1&#8208;indanone (A2) as two different conjugated terminals on the central fused core (D), wherein they share the same backbone as well&#8208;known NFA Y6, but at different terminals. Such asymmetric NFAs with A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2 structure exhibit superior photovoltaic properties when blended with polymer donor PM6. Energy loss analysis reveals that asymmetric molecule BTP&#8208;S2 with six chlorine atoms attached at the terminals enables the corresponding devices to give an outstanding electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2%, one order of magnitude higher than devices based on symmetric Y6 (4.4 &#215; 10&#8722;3%), thus significantly lowering the nonradiative loss and energy loss of the corresponding devices. Besides, asymmetric BTP&#8208;S1 and BTP&#8208;S2 with multiple halogen atoms at the terminals exhibit fast hole transfer to the donor PM6. As a result, OPVs based on the PM6:BTP&#8208;S2 blend realize a PCE of 16.37%, higher than that (15.79%) of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OPVs. A further optimization of the ternary blend (PM6:Y6:BTP&#8208;S2) results in a best PCE of 17.43%, which is among the highest efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OPVs. This work provides an effective approach to simultaneously lower the energy loss and promote the charge separation of OPVs by molecular design strategy.

      <title>A Generalized Surface Chalcogenation Strategy for Boosting the Electrochemical N2 Fixation of Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface chalcogenation is demonstrated as a highly universal and efficient strategy to improve the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance of various metal nanocrystals (NCs), where the optimized surface selenated Rh NCs (Rh&#8208;Se NCs) exhibit excellent NRR performance with NH3 production about 16.0 folds higher than that of Rh NCs, opening a versatile approach for future NH3 production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising process relative to energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. While conventional electrocatalysts underperform with sluggish paths, achieving dissociation of N2 brings the key challenge for enhancing NRR. This study proposes an effective surface chalcogenation strategy to improve the NRR performance of pristine metal nanocrystals (NCs). Surprisingly, the NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency (FE) (175.6 &#177; 23.6 mg h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1Rh and 13.3 &#177; 0.4%) of Rh&#8208;Se NCs is significantly enhanced by 16 and 15 times, respectively. Detailed investigations show that the superior activity and high FE are attributed to the effect of surface chalcogenation, which not only can decrease the apparent activation energy, but also inhibit the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interface strain effect within core@shell system induces a critical redox inversion, resulting in a rather low valence state of Rh and Se surface sites. Such strong correlation indicates an efficient electron&#8208;transfer minimizing NRR barrier. Significantly, the surface chalcogenation strategy is general, which can extend to create other NRR metal electrocatalysts with enhanced performance. This strategy open a new avenue for future NH3 production for breakthrough in the bottleneck of NRR.

      <title>Cobalt Plasmonic Superstructures Enable Almost 100% Broadband Photon Efficient CO2 Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A cobalt plasmonic superstructure is developed to enable almost 100% broadband photon efficient CO2 photocatalysis through enhanced plasmonic excitation by the hybridization of Co nanoparticles in close proximity, as well as inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;band transitions. This work will bridge the gap between plasmonic absorbers with photothermal catalysis, toward the complete utilization of the solar energy.








Abstract
The efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis for converting solar to chemical energy is low on a per photon basis mainly because of the difficulty of capturing and utilizing light across the entire solar spectral wavelength range. This challenge is addressed herein with a plasmonic superstructure, fashioned as an array of nanoscale needles comprising cobalt nanocrystals assembled within a sheath of porous silica grown on a fluorine tin oxide substrate. This plasmonic superstructure can strongly absorb sunlight through different mechanisms including enhanced plasmonic excitation by the hybridization of Co nanoparticles in close proximity, as well as inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;band transitions. With nearly 100% sunlight harvesting ability, it drives the photothermal hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with a 20&#8208;fold rate increase from the silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalyst. The present work bridges the gap between strong light&#8208;absorbing plasmonic superstructures with photothermal CO2 catalysis toward the complete utilization of the solar energy.

      <title>Enhancement of the Magnetic Coupling in Exfoliated CrCl3 Crystals Observed by Low&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy and X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism are used to investigate micromechanically cleaved flakes of chromium trichloride crystals, highlighting a ninefold increase of antiferromagnetic coupling between layers after exfoliation. Joint topographic and magnetic measurements by MFM on individual flakes show a common behavior in the 10&#8211;50 nm thickness range.








Abstract
Magnetic crystals formed by 2D layers interacting by weak van der Waals forces are currently a hot research topic. When these crystals are thinned to nanometric size, they can manifest strikingly different magnetic behavior compared to the bulk form. This can be the result of, for example, quantum electronic confinement effects, the presence of defects, or pinning of the crystallographic structure in metastable phases induced by the exfoliation process. In this work, an investigation of the magnetism of micromechanically cleaved CrCl3 flakes with thickness &gt;10 nm is performed. These flakes are characterized by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, and spatially resolved magnetic force microscopy. The results highlight an enhancement of the CrCl3 antiferromagnetic interlayer interaction that appears to be independent of the flake size when the thickness is tens of nanometers. The estimated exchange field is 9 kOe, representing an increase of &#8776;900% compared to the one of the bulk crystals. This effect can be attributed to the pinning of the high&#8208;temperature monoclinic structure, as recently suggested by polarized Raman spectroscopy investigations in thin (8&#8211;35 nm) CrCl3 flakes.

      <title>Unidirectional and Selective Proton Transport in Artificial Heterostructured Nanochannels with Nano&#8208;to&#8208;Subnano Confined Water Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer nanochannels are constructed, where water molecules are confined to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions and to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural voltage&#8208;gated proton channels.








Abstract
The construction of biological proton channel analogues has attracted substantial interest owing to their wide potential in separation of ions, sensing, and energy conversion. Here, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer heterogeneous nanochannels are presented, in which water molecules are confined to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions and to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural proton channels. Given the nano&#8208;to&#8208;subnano confined water junctions, experimental proton conductivities in the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;MOF direction of the channels are much higher than those in the opposite direction, showing a high rectification up to 500 and one to two orders of magnitude enhancement compared to the conductivity of proton transport in bulk water.

&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer nanochannels are constructed, where water molecules are confined to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions and to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural voltage&#8208;gated proton channels.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of biological proton channel analogues has attracted substantial interest owing to their wide potential in separation of ions, sensing, and energy conversion. Here, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer heterogeneous nanochannels are presented, in which water molecules are confined to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions and to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural proton channels. Given the nano&#8208;to&#8208;subnano confined water junctions, experimental proton conductivities in the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;MOF direction of the channels are much higher than those in the opposite direction, showing a high rectification up to 500 and one to two orders of magnitude enhancement compared to the conductivity of proton transport in bulk water. The channels also show a good proton selectivity over other cations.

      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change materials feature drastic increase in molecular mobility upon melting. Leveraging this attribute, they are actively explored as a novel class of thermo&#8208;responsive materials for the encapsulation and release of various types of payloads, including anticancer drugs, inorganic ions, reactive species, biomacromolecules, and even functional nanoparticles, in a controllable manner.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) have emerged as a novel class of thermo&#8208;responsive materials for controlled release, where the payloads encapsulated in a solid matrix are released only upon melting the PCM to trigger a solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition. Herein, the advances over the past 10 years in utilizing PCMs as a versatile platform for the encapsulation and release of various types of therapeutic agents and biological effectors are highlighted. A brief introduction to PCMs in the context of desired properties for controlled release and related applications is provided. Among the various types of PCMs, a specific focus is placed on fatty acids and fatty alcohols for their natural availability, low toxicity, biodegradability, diversity, high abundance, and low cost. Then, various methods capable of processing PCMs, and their mixtures with payloads, into stable suspensions of colloidal particles, and the different means for triggering the solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition are discussed. Finally, a range of applications enabled by the controlled release system based on PCMs are presented together with some perspectives on future directions.

      <title>Can Reconstructed Se&#8208;Deficient Line Defects in Monolayer VSe2 Induce Magnetism?</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional defect line patterns are formed in monolayer VSe2 upon high&#8208;temperature annealing. X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic force microscopy confirm that such Se&#8208;deficient reconstructed defects cause the onset of ferromagnetism in pristine VSe2. This study provides a way to engineer the magnetism via controlling the atomic structures of surface defects in 2D crystals.








Abstract
There have been several recent conflicting reports on the ferromagnetism of clean monolayer VSe2. Herein, the controllable formation of 1D defect line patterns in vanadium diselenide (VSe2) monolayers initiated by thermal annealing is presented. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and q&#8208;plus atomic force microscopy techniques, the 1D line features are determined to be 8&#8208;member&#8208;ring arrays, formed via a Se deficient reconstruction process. The reconstructed VSe2 monolayer with Se&#8208;deficient line defects displays room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism under X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic force microscopy, consistent with the density functional theory calculations. This study possibly resolves the controversy on whether ferromagnetism is intrinsic in monolayer VSe2, and highlights the importance of controlling and understanding the atomic structures of surface defects in 2D crystals, which could play key roles in the material properties and hence potential device applications.

      <title>Multimodal and Covert&#8211;Overt Convertible Structural Coloration Transformed by Mechanical Stress</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled SiO2&#8208;nanoparticle patterns encapsulated by poly(dimethylsiloxane) are developed as a novel and simple color platform, which can switch between transparent and colored states by mechanical stresses. Upon compression, wrinkles are generated as gratings, enabling the instant display and hiding of information such as quick response codes and trademarks by external stimuli. The color platform has potential for application in anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Most materials and devices with structurally switchable color features responsive to external stimuli can actively and flexibly display various colors. However, realizing covert&#8211;overt transformation behavior, especially switching between transparent and colored states, is more challenging. A composite laminate of soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with a rigid SiO2&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) structure pattern is developed as a multidimensional structural color platform. Owing to the similarity in the optical properties of PDMS and SiO2 NPs, this device is fully transparent in the normal state. However, as their mechanical strengths differ considerably, upon compressive loading, a buckling&#8208;type instability arises on the surface of the laminate, leading to the generation of 1D or 2D wrinkled patterns in the form of gratings. Finally, an application of the device in which quick response codes are displayed or hidden as covert&#8211;overt convertible colored patterns for optical encryption/decryption, showing their remarkable potential for anticounterfeiting applications, is demonstrated.

      <title>Anisotropic Quantum Transport through a Single Spin Channel in the Magnetic Semiconductor EuTiO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations in the ferromagnetic state of EuTiO3 are realized. It is shown that the oscillations originate genuinely from Ti 3d&#8208;t2g states, which are fully spin&#8208;polarized due to their energetical proximity to the in&#8208;gap Eu 4f bands. These findings suggest that EuTiO3 film is an ideal magnetic semiconductor, offering a fertile field to explore quantum phenomena.








Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors are a vital component in the understanding of quantum transport phenomena. To explore such delicate, yet fundamentally important, effects, it is crucial to maintain a high carrier mobility in the presence of magnetic moments. In practice, however, magnetization often diminishes the carrier mobility. Here, it is shown that EuTiO3 is a rare example of a magnetic semiconductor that can be desirably grown using the molecular beam epitaxy to possess a high carrier mobility exceeding 3000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 2 K, while intrinsically hosting a large magnetization value, 7 &#956;B per formula unit. This is demonstrated by measuring the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas (SdH) oscillations in the ferromagnetic state of EuTiO3 films with various carrier densities. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, it is shown that the observed SdH oscillations originate genuinely from Ti 3d&#8208;t2g states which are fully spin&#8208;polarized due to their energetical proximity to the in&#8208;gap Eu 4f bands. Such an exchange coupling is further shown to have a profound effect on the effective mass and fermiology of the Ti 3d&#8208;t2g electrons, manifested by a directional anisotropy in the SdH oscillations. These findings suggest that EuTiO3 film is an ideal magnetic semiconductor, offering a fertile field to explore quantum phenomena suitable for spintronic applications.

      <title>An Electrically Modulated Single&#8208;Color/Dual&#8208;Color Imaging Photodetector</title>
      <dc:description>
A tunable dual&#8208;color imaging photodetector with a fast response speed (&#8776;102 ns) is developed by constructing a type&#8208;I p&#8211;n heterojunction of CH3NH3PbBr3/COi8DFIC. Dual&#8208;color imaging can be switched to single&#8208;color imaging by applying a small bias voltage.








Abstract
An electrically modulated single&#8208;/dual&#8208;color imaging photodetector with fast response speed is developed based on a small molecule (COi8DFIC)/perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr3) hybrid film. Owing to the type&#8208;I heterojunction, the device can facilely transform dual&#8208;color images to single&#8208;color images by applying a small bias voltage. The photodetector exhibits two distinct cut&#8208;off wavelengths at &#8776;544 nm (visible region) and &#8776;920 nm (near&#8208;infrared region), respectively, without any power supply. Its two peak responsivities are 0.16 A W&#8722;1 at &#8776;525 nm and 0.041 A W&#8722;1 at &#8776;860 nm with a fast response speed (&#8776;102 ns). Under 0.6 V bias, the photodetector can operate in a single&#8208;color mode with a peak responsivity of 0.09 A W&#8722;1 at &#8776;475 nm, showing a fast response speed (&#8776;102 ns). A physical model based on band energy theory is developed to illustrate the origin of the tunable single&#8208;/dual&#8208;color photodetection. This work will stimulate new approaches for developing solution&#8208;processed multifunctional photodetectors for imaging photodetection in complex circumstances.

     alt="An Electrically Modulated Single&#8208;Color/Dual&#8208;Color Imaging Photodetector"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tunable dual&#8208;color imaging photodetector with a fast response speed (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ns) is developed by constructing a type&#8208;I p&#8211;n heterojunction of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;8DFIC. Dual&#8208;color imaging can be switched to single&#8208;color imaging by applying a small bias voltage.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrically modulated single&#8208;/dual&#8208;color imaging photodetector with fast response speed is developed based on a small molecule (CO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;8DFIC)/perovskite (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) hybrid film. Owing to the type&#8208;I heterojunction, the device can facilely transform dual&#8208;color images to single&#8208;color images by applying a small bias voltage. The photodetector exhibits two distinct cut&#8208;off wavelengths at &#8776;544 nm (visible region) and &#8776;920 nm (near&#8208;infrared region), respectively, without any power supply. Its two peak responsivities are 0.16 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;525 nm and 0.041 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;860 nm with a fast response speed (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ns). Under 0.6 V bias, the photodetector can operate in a single&#8208;color mode with a peak responsivity of 0.09 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;475 nm, showing a fast response speed (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ns). A physical model based on band energy theory is developed to illustrate the origin of the tunable single&#8208;/dual&#8208;color photodetection. This work will stimulate new approaches for developing solution&#8208;processed multifunctional photodetectors for imaging photodetection in complex circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Regulated Energy Transfer in Chiral Liquid Crystals for Enhancing Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Steering the Photonic Bandgap</title>
      <dc:description>
Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals based on a radiative energy&#8208;transfer process from upconversion nanoparticles can be realized in chiral nematic liquid crystals. A very large dissymmetry factor of around 1.1 for the UC&#8208;CPL is obtained. In addition, a voltage&#8208;force&#8208;regulated chiroptical switch of UC&#8208;CPL can be realized.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescent materials with high dissymmetry factor (glum) have been attracting increasing attention due to their distinctive photonic properties. In this work, by incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (PKNCs) into a chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*LC), enhanced upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) based on a radiative energy transfer (RET) process from UCNPs to CsPbBr3 PKNCs is successfully implemented. By locating the emission peak of CsPbBr3 PKNCs at the center of the photonic bandgap of N*LC, the maximum glum value of UC&#8208;CPL can be amplified to an extremely large value of 1.1. Meanwhile, upconverted emission of UCNPs can be significantly enhanced due to the band edge enhancement effect of the N*LC, subsequently enhancing the emission of the CsPbBr3 PKNCs through the RET process. In addition, an applied electric field can switch the upconverted emission of the UCNPs, as well as the RET process, enabling an electric&#8208;field&#8208;controlled UC&#8208;CPL switch.

      <title>Photomodulation of Charge Transport in All&#8208;Semiconducting 2D&#8211;1D van der Waals Heterostructures with Suppressed Persistent Photoconductivity Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (VDWHs) are fabricated based on 1D graphene nanoribbon onto 2D MoS2, showing significantly suppressed persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2. Photomodulation of the charge transport of the obtained VDWHs field&#8208;effect transistor is realized by interfacing with photochromic molecules, demonstrating its great potential for multilevel memories, which are promising for future development of ultrathin multifunctional optoelectronics.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (VDWHs), obtained via the controlled assembly of 2D atomically thin crystals, exhibit unique physicochemical properties, rendering them prototypical building blocks to explore new physics and for applications in optoelectronics. As the emerging alternatives to graphene, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides and bottom&#8208;up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising candidates for overcoming the shortcomings of graphene, such as the absence of a bandgap in its electronic structure, which is essential in optoelectronics. Herein, VDWHs comprising GNRs onto monolayer MoS2 are fabricated. Field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on such VDWHs show an efficient suppression of the persistent photoconductivity typical of MoS2, resulting from the interfacial charge transfer process. The MoS2&#8208;GNR FETs exhibit drastically reduced hysteresis and more stable behavior in the transfer characteristics, which is a prerequisite for the further photomodulation of charge transport behavior within the MoS2&#8208;GNR VDWHs. The physisorption of photochromic molecules onto the MoS2&#8208;GNR VDWHs enables reversible light&#8208;driven control over charge transport. In particular, the drain current of the MoS2&#8208;GNR FET can be photomodulated by 52%, without displaying significant fatigue over at least 10 cycles. Moreover, four distinguishable output current levels can be achieved, demonstrating the great potential of MoS2&#8208;GNR VDWHs for multilevel memory devices.

      <title>Biocompatible Magnetic Micro&#8208; and Nanodevices: Fabrication of FePt Nanopropellers and Cell Transfection</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible hard nanomagnets that can easily be fabricated are shown to enable active gene delivery. Co&#8208;depositing iron (Fe) and platinum (Pt) followed by an annealing step yields noncytotoxic ferromagnetic FePt nanopropellers that possess a remanence and magnetization that rival those of NdFeB micromagnets. This study describes the fabrication and material characterization, and shows that FePt is promising for microrobotics and biomedical applications.








Abstract
The application of nanoparticles for drug or gene delivery promises benefits in the form of single&#8208;cell&#8208;specific therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities. Many methods of cell transfection rely on unspecific means to increase the transport of genetic material into cells. Targeted transport is in principle possible with magnetically propelled micromotors, which allow responsive nanoscale actuation and delivery. However, many commonly used magnetic materials (e.g., Ni and Co) are not biocompatible, possess weak magnetic remanence (Fe3O4), or cannot be implemented in nanofabrication schemes (NdFeB). Here, it is demonstrated that co&#8208;depositing iron (Fe) and platinum (Pt) followed by one single annealing step, without the need for solution processing, yields ferromagnetic FePt nanomotors that are noncytotoxic, biocompatible, and possess a remanence and magnetization that rival those of permanent NdFeB micromagnets. Active cell targeting and magnetic transfection of lung carcinoma cells are demonstrated using gradient&#8208;free rotating millitesla fields to drive the FePt nanopropellers. The carcinoma cells express enhanced green fluorescent protein after internalization and cell viability is unaffected by the presence of the FePt nanopropellers. The results establish FePt, prepared in the L10 phase, as a promising magnetic material for biomedical applications with superior magnetic performance, especially for micro&#8208; and nanodevices.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Ion Exchange of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Hybrid for Multimodal Imaging and Synergistic Therapy of Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework hybrid is designed as a precursor of a nanotheranostic agent (pro&#8208;NTA) to selectively synthesize an NTA with the release of Mn2+ ions in tumor tissues. This pro&#8208;NTA activation strategy provides multimodal diagnosis and tumor treatment with high specificity.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents (NTAs) that integrate diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic functions have great potential for personalized medicine, yet poor tumor specificity severely restricts further clinical applications of NTAs. Here, a pro&#8208;NTA (precursor of nanotheranostic agent) activation strategy is reported for in situ NTA synthesis at tumor tissues to enhance the specificity of tumor therapy. This pro&#8208;NTA, also called PBAM, is composed of an MIL&#8208;100 (Fe)&#8208;coated Prussian blue (PB) analogue (K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]) with negligible absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region and spatial confinement of Mn2+ ions. In a mildly acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), PBAM can be specifically activated to synthesize the photothermal agent PB nanoparticles, with release of free Mn2+ ions due to the internal fast ion exchange, resulting in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state of both T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and photoacoustic signals. In addition, the combined Mn2+&#8208;mediated chemodynamic therapy in the TME and PB&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy guarantee a more efficient therapeutic performance compared to monotherapy. In vivo data further show that the pro&#8208;NTA activation strategy could selectively brighten solid tumors and detect invisible lymph node metastases with high specificity.

      <dc:description>
Reduction&#8208;responsive nanocapsules (Ang&#8208;NCss(siRNA)) are readily prepared from interfacial polymerization with disulfide bonds as cross&#8208;linkers, followed by target ligand Angiopep&#8208;2 functionalization. The developed siRNA nanocapsules show small size, excellent stability, outstanding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, and tumor accumulation, leading to effective suppression of orthotopic glioblastoma with negligible side effects. Such an siRNA nanocapsule displays promising application potential in brain disease RNAi therapy.








Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been considered as a highly promising therapeutic agent for human cancer treatment including glioblastoma (GBM), which is a fatal disease without effective therapy methods. However, siRNA&#8208;based GBM therapy is seriously hampered by a number of challenges in siRNA brain delivery including poor stability, short blood circulation, low blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and tumor accumulation, as well as inefficient siRNA intracellular release. Herein, an Angiopep&#8208;2 (Ang) functionalized intracellular&#8208;environment&#8208;responsive siRNA nanocapsule (Ang&#8208;NCss(siRNA)) is successfully developed as a safe and efficient RNAi agent to boost siRNA&#8208;based GBM therapy. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed Ang&#8208;NCss(siRNA) displays long circulation in plasma, efficient BBB penetration capability, and GBM accumulation and retention, as well as responsive intracellular siRNA release due to the unique design of small size (25 nm) with polymeric shell for siRNA protection, Ang functionalization for BBB crossing and GBM targeting, and disulfide bond as a linker for intracellular&#8208;environment&#8208;responsive siRNA release. Such superior properties of Ang&#8208;NCss(siRNA) result in outstanding growth inhibition of orthotopic U87MG xenografts without causing adverse effects, achieving remarkably improved survival benefits. The developed siRNA nanocapsules provide a new strategy for RNAi therapy of GBM and beyond.

      <title>An On&#8208;Skin Electrode with Anti&#8208;Epidermal&#8208;Surface&#8208;Lipid Function Based on a Zwitterionic Polymer Brush</title>
      <dc:description>
An on&#8208;skin electrode with anti&#8208;epidermal&#8208;surface&#8208;lipid function is presented, which enables the cleaning of fouling due to skin lipids on the electrode surface by water rinsing alone, due to the grafting of a zwitterionic polymer brush. When applied for electrophysiological monitoring, the electrodes can maintain consistent contact impedance and good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by simple water rinsing.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin flexible devices provide a noninvasive approach for continuous and real&#8208;time acquisition of biological signals from the skin, which is essential for future chronic disease diagnosis and smart health monitoring. Great progress has been achieved in flexible devices to resolve the mechanical mismatching between conventional rigid devices and human skin. However, common materials used for flexible devices including silicon&#8208;based elastomers and various metals exhibit no resistance to epidermal surface lipids (skin oil and grease), which restricts the long&#8208;term and household usability. Herein, an on&#8208;skin electrode with anti&#8208;epidermal&#8208;surface&#8208;lipid function is reported, which is based on the grafting of a zwitterionic poly(2&#8208;methacryl&#8208;oyloxyethyl, methacryloyl&#8208;oxyethyl, or meth&#8208;acryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) brush on top of gold&#8208;coated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (Au/PDMS). Such an electrode allows the skin&#8208;lipids&#8208;fouled surface to be cleaned by simple water rinsing owing to the superhydrophilic zwitterionic groups. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the PMPC&#8208;Au/PDMS electrodes are employed for both electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) recording. The electrodes are able to maintain stable skin&#8208;electrode impedance and good signal&#8208;to noise ratio (SNR) by water rinsing alone. This work provides a material&#8208;based solution to improve the long&#8208;term reusability of on&#8208;skin electronics and offers a unique prospective on developing next generation wearable healthcare devices.

      <title>Bioinspired Protein&#8208;Based Assembling: Toward Advanced Life&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;bounded microcompartments (proteinosomes) are a versatile synthetic basis for integrating a wide range of functional components and biochemical machineries capable of imitating rudimentary aspects of living cells. Steps toward the construction of higher&#8208;order, life&#8208;like microensembles to advance the chemical and physical basis of cell structure and function are discussed.








Abstract
The ability of living organisms to perform structure, energy, and information&#8208;related processes for molecular self&#8208;assembly through compartmentalization and chemical transformation can possibly be mimicked via artificial cell models. Recent progress in the development of various types of functional microcompartmentalized ensembles that can imitate rudimentary aspects of living cells has refocused attention on the important question of how inanimate systems can transition into living matter. Hence, herein, the most recent advances in the construction of protein&#8208;bounded microcompartments (proteinosomes), which have been exploited as a versatile synthetic chassis for integrating a wide range of functional components and biochemical machineries, are critically summarized. The techniques developed for fabricating various types of proteinosomes are discussed, focusing on the significance of how chemical information, substance transportation, enzymatic&#8208;reaction&#8208;based metabolism, and self&#8208;organization can be integrated and recursively exploited in constructed ensembles. Therefore, proteinosomes capable of exhibiting gene&#8208;directed protein synthesis, modulated membrane permeability, spatially confined membrane&#8208;gated catalytic reaction, internalized cytoskeletal&#8208;like matrix assembly, on&#8208;demand compartmentalization, and predatory&#8208;like chemical communication in artificial cell communities are specially highlighted. These developments are expected to bridge the gap between materials science and life science, and offer a theoretical foundation for developing life&#8208;inspired assembled materials toward various applications.

      <title>2D Electrets of Ultrathin MoO2 with Apparent Piezoelectricity</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal MoO2 flakes with monoclinic structure results in the formation of voids in the structure, which act as sources for trapping and stabilizing charges. The emergent electret&#8208;like behavior in 2D of an otherwise non&#8208;piezoelectric bulk material is capable of artificially engineering piezoelectricity in 2D materials.








Abstract
Since graphene, a variety of 2D materials have been fabricated in a quest for a tantalizing combination of properties and desired physiochemical behavior. 2D materials that are piezoelectric, i.e., that allow for a facile conversion of electrical energy into mechanical and vice versa, offer applications for sensors, actuators, energy harvesting, stretchable and flexible electronics, and energy storage, among others. Unfortunately, materials must satisfy stringent symmetry requirements to be classified as piezoelectric. Here, 2D ultrathin single&#8208;crystal molybdenum oxide (MoO2) flakes that exhibit unexpected piezoelectric&#8208;like response are fabricated, as MoO2 is centrosymmetric and should not exhibit intrinsic piezoelectricity. However, it is demonstrated that the apparent piezoelectricity in 2D MoO2 emerges from an electret&#8208;like behavior induced by the trapping and stabilization of charges around defects in the material. Arguably, the material represents the first 2D electret material and suggests a route to artificially engineer piezoelectricity in 2D crystals. Specifically, it is found that the maximum out&#8208;of&#8208;plane piezoresponse is 0.56 pm V&#8722;1, which is as strong as that observed in conventional 2D piezoelectric materials. The charges are found to be highly stable at room temperature with a trapping energy barrier of &#8776;2 eV.

      <title>Phosphonate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: A Novel Family of Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
The first semiconducting metal&#8211;organic framework (known as TUB75) derived from arylphosphonic acids and a depiction of its antiferromagnetic 1D inorganic building unit composed of a zigzag chain of corner&#8208;sharing copper dimers.








Abstract
Herein, the first semiconducting and magnetic phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), TUB75, is reported, which contains a 1D inorganic building unit composed of a zigzag chain of corner&#8208;sharing copper dimers. The solid&#8208;state UV&#8211;vis spectrum of TUB75 reveals the existence of a narrow bandgap of 1.4 eV, which agrees well with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;calculated bandgap of 1.77 eV. Single&#8208;crystal conductivity measurements for different orientations of the individual crystals yield a range of conductances from 10&#8722;3 to 103 S m&#8722;1 at room temperature, pointing to the directional nature of the electrical conductivity in TUB75. Magnetization measurements show that TUB75 is composed of antiferromagnetically coupled copper dimer chains. Due to their rich structural chemistry and exceptionally high thermal/chemical stabilities, phosphonate MOFs like TUB75 may open new vistas in engineerable electrodes for supercapacitors.

      <title>Single&#8208;Nanocrystal Arrays: Fabrication of Single&#8208;Nanocrystal Arrays (Adv. Mater. 18/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1904551, Paul Mulvaney and co&#8208;workers review the development of single nanocrystal fabrication and assembly. Directed assembly methods rely on an external force to drive pre&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials onto a templated surface. These methods offer nanometer spatial resolution for a wide range of materials and they also offer scalability. A CdSe/CdS quantum dot array being nanofabricated by electrophoretic assembly is depicted. The background shows the scattered light (red) observed from real arrays.

      <title>Designing with Light: Advanced 2D, 3D, and 4D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Light is a powerful stimulus, providing easy access to spatiotemporal control, and has been widely employed for material design. As such, photochemical methods empower the fabrication of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at lengths ranging from nano&#8208; to macroscale.








Abstract
Recent achievements and future opportunities for the design of 2D, 3D, and 4D materials using photochemical reactions are summarized. Light is an attractive stimulus for material design due to its outstanding spatiotemporal control, and its ability to mediate rapid polymerization under moderate reaction temperatures. These features have been significantly enhanced by major advances in light generation/manipulation with light&#8208;emitting diodes and optical fiber technologies which now allows for a broad range of cost&#8208;effective fabrication protocols. This combination is driving the preparation of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macrosize scales. Looking ahead, future challenges and opportunities that will significantly impact the field and help shape the future of light as a versatile and tunable design tool are highlighted.

      <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Nanocrystal Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>
An overview of the direct assembly methods used to fabricate single nanocrystal arrays is provided. The five principal methods used and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. Potential future developments in the field are also presented.








Abstract
To realize the full potential of nanocrystals in nanotechnology, it is necessary to integrate single nanocrystals into addressable structures; for example, arrays and periodic lattices. The current methods for achieving this are reviewed. It is shown that a combination of top&#8208;down lithography techniques with directed assembly offers a platform for attaining this goal. The most promising of these directed assembly methods are reviewed: capillary force assembly, electrostatic assembly, optical printing, DNA&#8208;based assembly, and electrophoretic deposition. The last of these appears to offer a generic approach to fabrication of single&#8208;nanocrystal arrays.

      <title>Metal Clusters on Semiconductor Surfaces and Application in Catalysis with a Focus on Au and Ru</title>
      <dc:description>
Semiconductor surfaces can be modified by depositing metal clusters. Metal clusters have unique properties that change with the number of atoms forming the clusters. The procedures for depositing clusters onto semiconductor surfaces and the application of cluster&#8208;modified semiconductor surfaces in catalysis are addressed and experimental techniques for analyzing the surfaces are briefly reviewed.








Abstract
Metal clusters typically consist of two to a few hundred atoms and have unique properties that change with the type and number of atoms that form the cluster. Metal clusters can be generated with a precise number of atoms, and therefore have specific size, shape, and electronic structures. When metal clusters are deposited onto a substrate, their shape and electronic structure depend on the interaction with the substrate surface and thus depend on the properties of both the clusters and those of the substrate. Deposited metal clusters have discrete, individual electron energy levels that differ from the electron energy levels in the constituting individual atoms, isolated clusters, and the respective bulk material. The properties of clusters with a focus on Au and Ru, the methods to generate metal clusters, and the methods of deposition of clusters onto substrate surfaces are covered. The properties of cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are important for their application. The main application covered here is catalysis, and the methods for characterization of the cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are described.

      <title>Glycogen as a Building Block for Advanced Biological Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycogen is one of nature's unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticles, which holds promise as a material for biomedical, including therapeutic, applications. The recent literature on advancing glycogen as a building block for advanced biofunctional materials is reviewed.








Abstract
Biological nanoparticles found in living systems possess distinct molecular architectures and diverse functions. Glycogen is a unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticle fabricated by nature through a bottom&#8208;up approach. The biocatalytic synthesis of glycogen has evolved over time to form a nanometer&#8208;sized dendrimer&#8208;like structure (20&#8211;150 nm) with a highly branched surface and a dense core. This makes glycogen markedly different from other natural linear or branched polysaccharides and particularly attractive as a platform for biomedical applications. Glycogen is inherently biodegradable, nontoxic, and can be functionalized with diverse surface and internal motifs for enhanced biofunctional properties. Recently, there has been growing interest in glycogen as a natural alternative to synthetic polymers and nanoparticles in a range of applications. Herein, the recent literature on glycogen in the material&#8208;based sciences, including its use as a constituent in biodegradable hydrogels and fibers, drug delivery vectors, tumor targeting and penetrating nanoparticles, immunomodulators, vaccine adjuvants, and contrast agents, is reviewed. The various methods of chemical functionalization and physical assembly of glycogen nanoparticles into multicomponent nanodevices, which advance glycogen toward a functional therapeutic nanoparticle from nature and back again, are discussed in detail.

Lattice strain matching between the uniform elastic strains of nanowires and the uniform lattice&#8208;distortion strain of the martensitic transformation of the matrix in composites allows an effective load transfer from the matrix to the nanowires. This induces ultralarge elastic strains in nanowires, overcoming a long&#8208;standing challenge to harness the superior intrinsic properties of nanomaterials in bulk forms.








Abstract
Nanosized materials are known to have the ability to withstand ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) and to have ultrahigh strengths approaching their theoretical limits. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to harnessing their exceptional intrinsic mechanical properties in bulk forms. This is commonly known as &#8220;the valley of death&#8221; in nanocomposite design. In 2013, a breakthrough was made to overcome this challenge by using a martensitic phase transforming matrix to create a composite in which ultralarge elastic lattice strains up to 6.7% are achieved in Nb nanoribbons embedded in it. This breakthrough was enabled by a novel concept of phase transformation assisted lattice strain matching between the uniform ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) of nanomaterials and the uniform crystallographic lattice distortion strains (4&#8211;10%) of the martensitic phase transformation of the matrix. This novel concept has opened new opportunities for developing materials of exceptional mechanical properties or enhanced functional properties that are not possible before. The work in progress in this research over the past six years is reported.

      <title>Advanced Actuator Materials Powered by Biomimetic Helical Fiber Topologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical actuation systems in plants and animals almost always involve helical structures and studies show that a helical arrangement of fibers in a compliant matrix generates a great diversity of movements and mechanical amplifications. Opportunities are identified to develop advanced artificial muscles since only a limited number of nature's mechanisms have been recreated in biomimetic systems to date.








Abstract
Helical constructs are ubiquitous in nature at all size domains, from molecular to macroscopic. The helical topology confers unique mechanical functions that activate certain phenomena, such as twining vines and vital cellular functions like the folding and packing of DNA into chromosomes. The understanding of active mechanical processes in plants, certain musculature in animals, and some biochemical processes in cells provides insight into the versatility of the helix. Most of these natural systems consist of helically oriented filaments embedded in a compliant matrix. In some cases, the matrix can change volume and in others the filaments can contract and the matrix is passive. In both cases, the helically arranged fibers determine the overall shape change with a great variety of responses involving length contraction/elongation, twisting, bending, and coiling. Synthetic actuator materials and systems that employ helical topologies have been described recently and demonstrate many fascinating and complex shape changes. However, significant new opportunities exist to mimic some of the most remarkable actions in nature, including the Vorticella's coiling stalk and DNA's supercoils, in the quest for superior artificial muscles.

      <title>Liquefied Sunshine: Transforming Renewables into Fertilizers and Energy Carriers with Electromaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Australia has an enormous potential to generate renewable energy from wind and solar, vastly more than is needed for domestic use. Most of this generation capacity is in remote regions such that means of transporting and storing this energy is required. Advances in the electrochemical production of chemical energy carriers including hydrogen, reduced carbon compounds, and ammonia are discussed.








Abstract
It has become apparent that renewable energy sources are plentiful in many, often remote, parts of the world, such that storing and transporting that energy has become the key challenge. For long&#8208;distance transportation by pipeline and bulk tanker, a liquid form of energy carrier is ideal, focusing attention on liquid hydrogen and ammonia. Development of high&#8208;activity and selectivity electrocatalyst materials to produce these energy carriers by reductive electrochemistry has therefore become an important area of research. Here, recent developments and challenges in the field of electrocatalytic materials for these processes are discussed, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Some of the mis&#8208;steps currently plaguing the nitrogen reduction to ammonia field are highlighted. The rapidly growing roles that in situ/operando and quantum chemical studies can play in new electromaterials discovery are also surveyed.

      <title>Shaping the Future of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes through Computational Modeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is challenging due to their low rates of diffusion compared to liquids, and complexities at the SSE/electrode interfaces. The role of theoretical simulations in dealing with these challenges is reviewed and a brief outlook about the future of simulations in studying the ASSB technology is presented.








Abstract
Advances and progress in computational research that aims to understand and improve solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are outlined. One of the main challenges in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is the design of new SSEs with high ion diffusivity that maintain chemical and phase stability and thereby provide a wide electrochemical stability window. Solving this problem requires a deep understanding of the diffusion mechanism and properties of the SSEs. A second important challenge is the development of an understanding of the interface between the SSE and the electrode. The role of molecular simulations and modeling in dealing with these challenges is discussed, with reference to examples in the literature. The methods used and issues considered in recent years are highlighted. Finally, a brief outlook about the future of modeling in studying solid&#8208;state battery technology is presented.

      <title>Solvation&#8208;Involved Nanoionics: New Opportunities from 2D Nanomaterial Laminar Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics is the study of ion transport and storage in nanoporous structures immersed in liquids involving various short&#8208;range atomic interactions. The fundamentals are introduced and the progress and opportunities enabled by 2D nanomaterial laminar membranes are discussed, which is of great interest for energy storage, desalination, ionic devices, and others.








Abstract
Nanoporous laminar membranes composed of multilayered 2D nanomaterials (2D&#8208;NLMs) are increasingly being exploited as a unique material platform for understanding solvated ion transport under nanoconfinement and exploring novel nanoionics&#8208;related applications, such as ion sieving, energy storage and harvesting, and in other new ionic devices. Here, the fundamentals of solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics in terms of ionic interactions and their effect on ionic transport behaviors are discussed. This is followed by a summary of key requirements for materials that are being used for solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics research, culminating in a demonstration of unique features of 2D&#8208;NLMs. Selected examples of using 2D&#8208;NLMs to address the key scientific problems related to nanoconfined ion transport and storage are then presented to demonstrate their enormous potential and capabilities for nanoionics research and applications. To conclude, a personal perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field is presented.

      <title>Nanostructured Carbon Nitrides for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured carbon nitride (CN) is studied as an advantageous platform for simultaneous CO2 capture and conversion to valuable feedstock using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, with remarkable catalytic activity, long durability, and high selectivity. The progressively discovered various novel CN materials and their hybrid nanostructures for the catalytic reduction of CO2 are highlighted, along with research challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives on this topic.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a 2D material composed of only carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), which are linked by strong covalent bonds, has been used as a metal&#8208;devoid and visible&#8208;light&#8208;active photocatalyst owing to its magnificent optoelectronic and physicochemical properties including suitable bandgap, adjustable energy&#8208;band positions, tailor&#8208;made surface functionalities, low cost, metal&#8208;free nature, and high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities. CN&#8208;based materials possess a lot of advantages over conventional metal&#8208;based inorganic photocatalysts including ease of synthesis and processing, versatile functionalization or doping, flexibility for surface engineering, low cost, sustainability, and recyclability without any leaching of toxic metals from photocorrosion. Carbon nitrides and their hybrid materials have emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 capture and its reduction into clean and green low&#8208;carbon fuels and valuable chemical feedstock by using sustainable and intermittent renewable energy sources of sunlight and electricity through the heterogeneous photo(electro)catalysis. Here, the latest research results in this field are summarized, including implementation of novel functionalized nanostructured CNs and their hybrid heterostructures in meeting the stringent requirements to raise the efficiency of the CO2 reduction process by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and feedstock reactions. The research in this field is primarily focused on advancement in the synthesis of nanostructured and functionalized CN&#8208;based hybrid heterostructured materials. More importantly, the recent past has seen a surge in studies focusing significantly on exploring the mechanism of their application perspectives, which include the behavior of the materials for the absorption of light, charge separation, and pathways for the transport of CO2 during the reduction process.

      <title>Role of Biomaterials and Controlled Architecture on Tendon/Ligament Repair and Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic tendons and ligaments (T/L) capable of both supporting appropriate tissue growth and providing biomechanical support for physiological loading is a significant challenge. Recent developments in the understanding of both material and architectural parameters that influence the repair and regeneration of T/L and advances in fabrication techniques are reviewed.








Abstract
Engineering synthetic scaffolds to repair and regenerate ruptured native tendon and ligament (T/L) tissues is a significant engineering challenge due to the need to satisfy both the unique biological and biomechanical properties of these tissues. Long&#8208;term clinical outcomes of synthetic scaffolds relying solely on high uniaxial tensile strength are poor with high rates of implant rupture and synovitis. Ideal biomaterials for T/L repair and regeneration need to possess the appropriate biological and biomechanical properties necessary for the successful repair and regeneration of ruptured tendon and ligament tissues.

      <title>The Quest for Zero Loss: Unconventional Materials for Plasmonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The quest for superior plasmonic materials is discussed and the evolution of the field from the elements, through to alloys and intermetallic compounds, semiconductors, conducting oxides and, most recently, topological insulators, considered. Although both gold and silver remain very attractive choices for plasmonic devices, it is shown that there are instances where alternative materials may be a better choice.








Abstract
There has been an ongoing quest to optimize the materials used to build plasmonic devices: first the elements were investigated, then alloys and intermetallic compounds, later semiconductors were considered, and, most recently, there has been interest in using more exotic materials such as topological insulators and conducting oxides. The quality of the plasmon resonances in these materials is closely correlated with their structure and properties. In general gold and silver are the most commonly specified materials for these applications but they do have weaknesses. Here, it is shown how, in specific circumstances, the selection of certain other materials might be more useful. Candidate alternatives include TixN, VO2, Al, Cu, Al&#8208;doped ZnO, and Cu&#8211;Al alloys. The relative merits of these choices and the many pitfalls and subtle problems that arise are discussed, and a frank perspective on the field is provided.

Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the top ten leading causes of death globally and the worst killer in low&#8208;income countries. The overuse of antibiotics leads to ever&#8208;increasing antibiotic resistance, posing a severe threat to human health. Recent advances in nanotechnology provide new opportunities to address the challenges in bacterial infection by killing germs without using antibiotics. Antibiotic&#8208;free antibacterial strategies enabled by advanced nanomaterials are presented. Nanomaterials are classified on the basis of their mode of action: nanomaterials with intrinsic or light&#8208;mediated bactericidal properties and others that serve as vehicles for the delivery of natural antibacterial compounds. Specific attention is given to antibacterial mechanisms and the structure&#8211;performance relationship. Practical antibacterial applications employing these antibiotic&#8208;free strategies are also introduced. Current challenges in this field and future perspectives are presented to stimulate new technologies and their translation to fight against bacterial infection.

      <title>Challenges in Fluorescence Detection of Chemical Warfare Agent Vapors Using Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;based detection is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting and identifying potential threats such as nerve agents. Due to the highly toxic nature of the agents themselves, studies to develop sensors have normally involved simulants. However, care is needed when interpreting the results of studies using common simulants.








Abstract
Organophosphorus (OP)&#8208;based nerve agents are extremely toxic and potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and recent attacks involving nerve agents highlight the need for fast detection and intervention. Fluorescence&#8208;based detection, where the sensing material undergoes a chemical reaction with the agent causing a measurable change in the luminescence, is one method for sensing and identifying nerve agents. Most studies use the simulants diethylchlorophosphate and di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylfluorophosphate to evaluate the performance of sensors due to their reduced toxicity relative to OP nerve agents. While detection of nerve agent simulants in solution is relatively widely reported, there are fewer reports on vapor detection using solid&#8208;state sensors. Herein, progress in organic semiconductor sensing materials developed for solid&#8208;state detection of OP&#8208;based nerve agent vapors is reviewed. The effect of acid impurities arising from the hydrolysis of simulants and nerve agents on the efficacy and selectivity of the reported sensing materials is also discussed. Indeed, in some cases it is unclear whether it is the simulant that is detected or the acid hydrolysis products. Finally, it is highlighted that while analyte diffusion into the sensing film is critical in the design of fast, responsive sensing systems, it is an area that is currently not well studied.

     alt="Challenges in Fluorescence Detection of Chemical Warfare Agent Vapors Using Solid&#8208;State Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence&#8208;based detection is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting and identifying potential threats such as nerve agents. Due to the highly toxic nature of the agents themselves, studies to develop sensors have normally involved simulants. However, care is needed when interpreting the results of studies using common simulants.

      <title>Polycrystalline Advanced Microporous Framework Membranes for Efficient Separation of Small Molecules and Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Polycrystalline advanced microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) have great potential for use in industrial separation applications. Recent advances in PMFM&#8208;fabrication technologies are highlighted and their applications in gas separation, water desalination, chiral resolution, and ion separation are explored. Some perspectives on further developments and challenges in this field are also presented.








Abstract
Advanced porous framework membranes with excellent selectivity and high permeability of small molecules and ions are highly desirable for many important industrial separation applications. There has been significant progress in the fabrication of polycrystalline microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) in recent years, such as metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework membranes. These membranes possess small pore sizes, which are comparable to the kinetic diameter of small molecules and ions on the angstrom scale, very low thickness, down to tens to hundreds of nanometers, highly oriented crystalline structures, hybrid membrane structures, and specific functional groups for enhancing membrane selectivity and permeability. Recent advances in the fabrication methods of advanced PMFMs are summarized. Following this, four emerging separation applications of these advanced microporous framework membranes, including gas separation, water desalination, ion separation, and chiral separation, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Finally, a summary and some perspectives of future developments and challenges in this exciting research field are presented.

      <title>How Nanoparticles Transform Single Molecule Measurements into Quantitative Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
The emerging applications of nanoparticle&#8208;enabled single&#8208;molecule detection are introduced. The recent advances in the development of single&#8208;nanoparticle assays for quantitative analysis as well as multiplexed detection are summarized. The key challenges and the prospects in this exciting field of research are also highlighted.








Abstract
Single molecule measurements are revolutionizing the understanding of the stochastics of behavior of single molecules. There is a common theme referred to as a near&#8208;field approach, in how many single molecule measurements are being performed in assays. The term near field is used because the measurement volume is typically very small such that a single molecule, or a single molecule binding pair, within that volume is of an appreciable concentration. The next development in detection will be performing many single molecule measurements at one time such that single molecule measurements can be used as the basis for quantitative analysis. There have already been some notable developments in this direction. Again, all have a common theme in that nanoparticles are used to create many near&#8208;field volumes that can be measured simultaneously. Herein, the coupled developments in nanoparticles and measurement strategies that allow nanoparticles to be the backbone of the next generation of sensing technologies are discussed.

The development and use of neutron powder diffraction for in operando measurements of rechargeable batteries is summarized, including experimental methods and approaches that impact the insight into battery materials function obtained.








Abstract
The performance of rechargeable batteries is influenced by the structural and phase changes of components during cycling. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) provides unique and useful information concerning the structure&#8211;function relation of battery components and can be used to study the changes to component phase and structure during battery cycling, known as in operando measurement studies. The development and use of NPD for in operando measurements of batteries is summarized along with detailed experimental approaches that impact the insights gained by these. A summary of the information gained concerning battery function using in operando NPD measurements is provided, including the structural and phase evolution of electrode materials and charge&#8208;carrying ion diffusion pathways through these, which are critical to the development of battery technology.

      <title>Exosomes and Nanoengineering: A Match Made for Precision Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in research and development of aptamer&#8208;guided exosomes as a new nanoengineering strategy to achieve targeted drug delivery using bio&#8208;nanoparticles highlight a promising next generation of targeted drug delivery systems. Cross&#8208;fertilization between areas of exosomes and aptamers in both preclinical translational studies predicts a bright future for aptamer&#8208;guided exosomal delivery in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
Targeted exosomal delivery systems for precision nanomedicine attract wide interest across areas of molecular cell biology, pharmaceutical sciences, and nanoengineering. Exosomes are naturally derived 50&#8211;150 nm nanovesicles that play important roles in cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell and/or cell&#8208;to&#8208;tissue communications and cross&#8208;species communication. Exosomes are also a promising class of novel drug delivery vehicles owing to their ability to shield their payload from chemical and enzymatic degradations as well as to evade recognition by and subsequent removal by the immune system. Combined with a new class of affinity ligands known as aptamers or chemical antibodies, molecularly targeted exosomes are poised to become the next generation of smartly engineered nanovesicles for precision medicine. Here, recent advances in targeted exosomal delivery systems engineered by aptamer for future strategies to promote human health using this class of human&#8208;derived nanovesicles are summarized.

Disruptive second&#8208;skin&#8208;like wearable biosensing technologies may enable a paradigm shift from current wearable 1.0 to future wearable 2.0 products. This may lead to ultimate biointegrated electronics transforming the healthcare industries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development in the key phases of future wearable technology is summarized in a progressive sequence, namely, wear &#8594; sense &#8594; communicate &#8594; analyze &#8594; interpret &#8594; decide.








Abstract
The wearable industry is on the rise, with a myriad of technical applications ranging from real&#8208;time health monitoring, the Internet of Things, and robotics, to name but a few. However, there is a saying &#8220;wearable is not wearable&#8221; because the current market&#8208;available wearable sensors are largely bulky and rigid, leading to uncomfortable wearing experience, motion artefacts, and poor data accuracy. This has aroused a world&#8208;wide intensive research quest for novel materials, with the aim of fabricating next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;lightweight and soft wearable devices. Such disruptive second&#8208;skin&#8208;like biosensing technologies may enable a paradigm shift from current wearable 1.0 to future wearable 2.0 products. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the key phases for future wearable technology, namely, wear &#8594; sense &#8594; communicate &#8594; analyze &#8594; interpret &#8594; decide, is summarized. Without a doubt, materials innovation is the key, which is the main focus of the discussion. In addition, emphasis is also given to wearable energy, multicomponent integration, and wireless communication.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymeric Materials through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking has recently emerged as a promising strategy for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials via self&#8208;association of multiple hydrogen bonds or the addition of external cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers exhibit a unique combination of high strength, large extensibility, thermostability, and even healable capability. Such a performance portfolio enables these polymeric materials to find many potential applications in the electronics and gas&#8208;separation fields.








Abstract
It has always been critical to develop high&#8208;performance polymeric materials with exceptional mechanical strength and toughness, thermal stability, and even healable properties for meeting performance requirements in industry. Conventional chemical cross&#8208;linking leads to enhanced mechanical strength and thermostability at the expense of extensibility due to mutually exclusive mechanisms. Such major challenges have recently been addressed by using noncovalent cross&#8208;linking of reversible multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds (H&#8208;bonds) that widely exist in biological materials, such as silk and muscle. Recent decades have witnessed the development of many tailor&#8208;made high&#8208;performance H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials. Here, recent advances in H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are reviewed for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials. H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking of polymers can be realized via i) self&#8208;association of interchain multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions or specific H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking motifs, such as 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone units with self&#8208;complementary quadruple H&#8208;bonds and ii) addition of external cross&#8208;linkers, including small molecules, nanoparticles, and polymer aggregates. The resultant cross&#8208;linked polymers normally exhibit tunable high strength, large extensibility, improved thermostability, and healable capability. Such performance portfolios enable these advanced polymers to find many significant cutting&#8208;edge applications. Major challenges facing existing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are discussed, and some promising approaches for designing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials in the future are also proposed.

      <title>Microplasmas for Advanced Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Microplasmas with exotic high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and nonequilibrium features are highly promising for the development of advanced materials and devices. The unique and useful properties of microplasmas, recent progress in nanomaterials production, and commercial applications are reviewed. The analysis may help guide rational synthesis of advanced functional materials and design of plasma devices in the future to meet the emerging demands in various fields.








Abstract
Microplasmas are low&#8208;temperature plasmas that feature microscale dimensions and a unique high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and a nonequilibrium reactive environment, which makes them promising for the fabrication of advanced nanomaterials and devices for diverse applications. Here, recent microplasma applications are examined, spanning from high&#8208;throughput, printing&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible synthesis of nanocrystalline particles of common materials types, to water purification and optoelectronic devices. Microplasmas combined with gaseous and/or liquid media at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure open new ways to form advanced functional materials and devices. Specific examples include gas&#8208;phase, substrate&#8208;free, plasma&#8208;liquid, and surface&#8208;supported synthesis of metallic, semiconducting, metal oxide, and carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials. Representative applications of microplasmas of particular importance to materials science and technology include light sources for multipurpose, efficient VUV/UV light sources for photochemical materials processing and spectroscopic materials analysis, surface disinfection, water purification, active electromagnetic devices based on artificial microplasma optical materials, and other devices and systems including the plasma transistor. The current limitations and future opportunities for microplasma applications in materials related fields are highlighted.

      <title>2D Electrocatalysts for Converting Earth&#8208;Abundant Simple Molecules into Value&#8208;Added Commodity Chemicals: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in 2D electrocatalysts are reviewed for emerging applications that utilize naturally existing nitrogen, oxygen, water, seawater, and methane as feedstocks. Areas of application considered include nitrogen reduction, two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, methane partial oxidation, and chorine evolution reactions to electrocatalytically generate ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and chorine.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into value&#8208;added commodity chemicals can transform current chemical production regimes with enormous socioeconomic and environmental benefits. For these applications, 2D electrocatalysts have emerged as a new class of high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst with massive forward&#8208;looking potential. Recent advances in 2D electrocatalysts are reviewed for emerging applications that utilize naturally existing H2O, N2, O2, Cl&#8722; (seawater) and CH4 (natural gas) as reactants for nitrogen reduction (N2 &#8594; NH3), two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (O2 &#8594; H2O2), chlorine evolution (Cl&#8722; &#8594; Cl2), and methane partial oxidation (CH4 &#8594; CH3OH) reactions to generate NH3, H2O2, Cl2, and CH3OH. The unique 2D features and effective approaches that take advantage of such features to create high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts are articulated with emphasis. To benefit the readers and expedite future progress, the challenges facing the future development of 2D electrocatalysts for each of the above reactions and the related perspectives are provided.

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Separators for Ionic&#8208;Liquid Electrolytes: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes are reviewed, specifically, separator morphology and ionic conductivity with an IL electrolyte. A compatible separator must be developed before ionic liquid electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely studied as a safer alternative electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The properties of IL electrolytes compared to conventional electrolytes make them more thermally stable, but they also have poor wetting with commercial separators. In a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the electrolyte should completely wet out the separator and electrodes to reduce the cell internal resistance. Investigations of cell materials with IL electrolytes have shown that the wetting issues in IL&#8211;electrolyte cells are most likely due to poor separator compatibility, not electrode compatibility. A compatible separator must be developed before IL electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, separators for IL electrolytes, including commercial and novel separators, are reviewed. Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different IL electrolytes are considered. Collated, the separator studies show a strong correlation between ionic conductivity and membrane porosity, even more than the electrolyte type. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet. Herein, it is revealed that a separator for IL electrolytes will most likely require a combination of high thermal and mechanical stability polymer, ceramic additives, and an optimized manufacturing process.

Herein, it is revealed that a separator for IL electrolytes will most likely require a combination of high thermal and mechanical stability polymer, ceramic additives, and an optimized manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitigation of Amyloidosis with Nanomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Amyloidosis is a biophysical phenomenon of protein aggregation with biological and pathogenic implications. Nanomaterials and nanocomposites possess a wide range of chemical compositions, surface properties, and architecture, thereby offering new solutions to mitigate against amyloidosis.








Abstract
Amyloidosis is a biophysical phenomenon of protein aggregation with biological and pathogenic implications. Among the various strategies developed to date, nanomaterials and multifunctional nanocomposites possessing certain structural and physicochemical traits are promising candidates for mitigating amyloidosis in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms underpinning protein aggregation and toxicity are introduced, and opportunities in materials science to drive this interdisciplinary field forward are highlighted. Advancement of this emerging frontier hinges on exploitation of protein self&#8208;assembly and interactions of amyloid proteins with nanoparticles, intracellular and extracellular proteins, chaperones, membranes, organelles, and biometals.

      <title>The Application of the Rare Earths to Magnesium and Titanium Metallurgy in Australia</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress related to research in Australia on magnesium and titanium metallurgy is reviewed, as rare earth elements (REEs) are of great interest for metallurgical applications. Several institutions are noted for extensive subject&#8208;matter expertise, while both the role of Sc and heavy lanthanides in magnesium, and the application of REEs to titanium additive manufacturing, are identified as promising research areas.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) have found application in metallurgical processes for nearly a century due to their unique chemical and physical properties but have gained increased attention in recent decades. Notably, the use of these elements may assist in the development of advanced magnesium and titanium products for applications spanning biomedicine, aerospace, and the automotive industry. To this end, current progress in this area, highlighting work done in Australian research organizations with particular academic expertise, is reviewed. Two areas that require further research are identified: the application of Sc and the heavy lanthanides to the development of novel magnesium alloys and the use of REEs as additives in the development of additive manufacturing of titanium parts.

      <title>Remedies for Polysulfide Dissolution in Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries are emerging as a very competitive choice for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. The understanding of and strategies for fatal polysulfide dissolution in sulfur cathodes are of crucial importance. Effective remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized, followed by future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries represent one of the most attractive technologies for future stationary energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. The S cathodes can react with Na ions via two&#8208;electron conversion reactions, thus achieving ultrahigh theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g&#8722;1) and specific energy (1273 Wh kg&#8722;1). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the nonconductive S, severe polysulfide dissolution, and the use of metallic Na are causing enormous challenges for the development of RT&#8208;NaS batteries. Fatal polysulfide dissolution is highlighted, important studies toward polysulfide immobilization and conversion are presented, and the reported remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized. Future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries are summarized.

      <title>Toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries: Opportunities and Challenges for Solid Organic Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are vital to advance today's consumer electronic and automobile applications. The advances in electromaterials research at Deakin University are summarized, with a focus on alternative solid electrolyte designs, including organic ionic plastic crystals, novel polymer electrolytes, and high capacity cathodes.








Abstract
With increasing demands for safe, high capacity energy storage to support personal electronics, newer devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the commercialization of electric vehicles, current energy storage technologies are facing increased challenges. Although alternative batteries have been intensively investigated, lithium (Li) batteries are still recognized as the preferred energy storage solution for the consumer electronics markets and next generation automobiles. However, the commercialized Li batteries still have disadvantages, such as low capacities, potential safety issues, and unfavorable cycling life. Therefore, the design and development of electromaterials toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span Li batteries with improved safety is a focus for researchers in the field of energy materials. Herein, recent advances in the development of novel organic electrolytes are summarized toward solid&#8208;state Li batteries with higher energy density and improved safety. On the basis of new insights into ionic conduction and design principles of organic&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, specific strategies toward developing these electrolytes for Li metal anodes, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials (e.g., high voltage materials), as well as the optimization of cathode formulations are outlined. Finally, prospects for next generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes are also proposed.

      <title>2D Superlattices for Efficient Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on 2D superlattices prepared by solution&#8208;phase strategies using diverse genuine unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks is summarized. A flocculation strategy is considered an efficient method for large&#8208;scale synthesis of these 2D superlattices. High&#8208;performance devices enabled by these 2D superlattices for energy storage and conversion are presented together with a discussion on challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
2D genuine unilamellar nanosheets, that are, the elementary building blocks of their layered parent crystals, have gained increasing attention, owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, and 2D features. In parallel with the great efforts to isolate these atomic&#8208;thin crystals, a unique strategy to integrate them into 2D vertically stacked heterostuctures has enabled many functional applications. In particular, such 2D heterostructures have recently exhibited numerous exciting electrochemical performances for energy storage and conversion, especially the molecular&#8208;scale heteroassembled superlattices using diverse 2D unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks. Herein, the research progress in scalable synthesis of 2D superlattices with an emphasis on a facile solution&#8208;phase flocculation method is summarized. A particular focus is brought to the advantages of these 2D superlattices in applications of supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, and water&#8208;splitting catalysis. The challenges and perspectives on this promising field are also outlined.

      <title>Catalysis of a Single Transition Metal Site for Water Oxidation: From Mononuclear Molecules to Single Atoms</title>
      <dc:description>
Focusing on single transition metal (TM) site catalysis, a clear roadmap with the correlations between the catalytic performances in water oxidation and the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures including coordination and geometric structure, TM species, and support is provided.

Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, nonprecious transition metal (TM) catalysts toward efficient water oxidation are of critical importance to future sustainable energy technologies. The advances in structure engineering of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) with single TM centers as active sites, for example, single metallic molecular complexes (SMMCs), supported SMMCs, and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in recent reports are examined. The efforts made on these configurations in terms of design principle, advanced characterization, performances and theoretical studies, are critically reviewed. A clear roadmap with the correlations between the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures (coordination and geometric structure, TM species, support), and the catalytic performances in water oxidation is provided. The insights bridging SMMCs with SACs are also given. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site catalysis are proposed.

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on single transition metal (TM) site catalysis, a clear roadmap with the correlations between the catalytic performances in water oxidation and the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures including coordination and geometric structure, TM species, and support is provided. Bridging remarks between single metallic molecular complexes and single&#8208;atom catalysts are also given.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low&#8208;cost, nonprecious transition metal (TM) catalysts toward efficient water oxidation are of critical importance to future sustainable energy technologies. The advances in structure engineering of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) with single TM centers as active sites, for example, single metallic molecular complexes (SMMCs), supported SMMCs, and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in recent reports are examined. The efforts made on these configurations in terms of design principle, advanced characterization, performances and theoretical studies, are critically reviewed. A clear roadmap with the correlations between the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures (coordination and geometric structure, TM species, support), and the catalytic performances in water oxidation is provided. The insights bridging SMMCs with SACs are also given. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site catalysis are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most direct way to observe the chemical and physical nanoscale dynamics of materials for energy applications. Recent progress of in situ TEM with respect to rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis is discussed.








Abstract
In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the most powerful approaches for revealing physical and chemical process dynamics at atomic resolutions. The most recent developments for in situ TEM techniques are summarized; in particular, how they enable visualization of various events, measure properties, and solve problems in the field of energy by revealing detailed mechanisms at the nanoscale. Related applications include rechargeable batteries such as Li&#8208;ion, Na&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;O2, Na&#8211;O2, Li&#8211;S, etc., fuel cells, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. To promote various applications, the methods of introducing the in situ stimuli of heating, cooling, electrical biasing, light illumination, and liquid and gas environments are discussed. The progress of recent in situ TEM in energy applications should inspire future research on new energy materials in diverse energy&#8208;related areas.

Abstract
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes are two key systems in harvesting sunlight for energy and environmental applications.

However, requirements to yield excellent performances are different in these two distinctive systems.

Here, considerations on selected typical factors governing the performances in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems, even though the same type of semiconductor is used, are provided. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms in relation to their photoactivities is of fundamental importance for rational design of high&#8208;performing photoactive materials, which may serve as a general guideline for the fabrication of good photocatalysts or photoelectrodes toward sustainable solar fuel generation.

      <title>Design Strategies to Enable the Efficient Use of Sodium Metal Anodes in High&#8208;Energy Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
To develop better and safer Na anodes for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;based batteries, it is essential to improve the understanding of the underlying battery chemistry and the materials applied. Challenges for using Na metal anodes are summarized and the recently developed material and design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are provided.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries have attracted considerable attention and are recognized as ideal candidates for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost energy storage. Sodium (Na) metal anodes are considered as one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;energy, Na&#8208;based batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g&#8722;1) and low standard electrode potential. Herein, an overview of the recent developments in Na metal anodes for high&#8208;energy batteries is provided. The high reactivity and large volume expansion of Na metal anodes during charge and discharge make the electrode/electrolyte interphase unstable, leading to the formation of Na dendrites, short cycle life, and safety issues. Design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are elucidated, including liquid electrolyte engineering, electrode/electrolyte interface optimization, sophisticated electrode construction, and solid electrolyte engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research directions are identified. It is hoped that this progress report will shape a consistent view of this field and provide inspiration for future research to improve Na metal anodes and enable the development of high&#8208;energy sodium batteries.

      <title>3D Printed Mechanically Robust Graphene/CNT Electrodes for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioinspired electrodes of 3D printed graphene reinforced by 1D carbon nanotubes (3DP GC), which demonstrate outstanding flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure, are produced via an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printing strategy. The 3DP GC electrodes developed in this work have great potential for a variety of energy conversion and storage, environmental, and electronic applications where high flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure are in pressing demand.








Abstract
3D printing of graphene electrodes with high mechanical strength has been a growing interest in the development of advanced energy, environment, and electronic systems, yet is extremely challenging. Herein, a 3D printed bioinspired electrode of graphene reinforced with 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (3DP GC) with both high flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure is reported via a 3D printing strategy. Mechanics modeling reveals the critical role of the 1D CNTs in the enhanced flexural strength by increasing the friction and adhesion between the 2D graphene nanosheets. The 3DP GC electrodes hold distinct advantages: i) an intrinsically high flexural strength that enables their large&#8208;scale applications; and ii) a hierarchical porous structure that offers large surface area and interconnected channels, endowing fast mass and/or charge and ions transport rate, which is thus beneficial for acting as an ideal catalyst carrier. The 3DP GC electrode integrated with a NiFeP nanosheets array exhibits a voltage of 1.58 V at 30 mA cm&#8722;2 as bifunctional electrode for water splitting, which is much better than most of the reported Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based bifunctional electrocatalysts. Importantly, this study paves the way for the practical applications of 3D printed graphene electrodes in many energy conversion/storage, environmental, and electronic systems where high flexural strength is preferred.

      <title>A Rational Reconfiguration of Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8211;Chalcogen Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The rational reconfiguration of an electrolyte enabled by an in situ interfacial polymerization strategy is demonstrated. This strategy endows Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se batteries with high capacity, stable cycling, and excellent rate performances simultaneously, and may become a new pathway toward the large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective applications of future Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;chalcogen batteries are an appealing choice for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage technology. However, the traditional battery that employs liquid electrolytes suffers irreversible loss and shuttle of the soluble intermediates. New batteries that adopt Li+&#8208;conductive polymer electrolytes to mitigate the shuttle problem are hindered by incomplete discharge of sulfur/selenium. To address the trade&#8208;off between energy and cycle life, a new electrolyte is proposed that reconciles the merits of liquid and polymer electrolytes while resolving each of their inferiorities. An in situ interfacial polymerization strategy is developed to create a liquid/polymer hybrid electrolyte between a LiPF6&#8208;coated separator and the cathode. A polymer&#8208;gel electrolyte in situ formed on the separator shows high Li+ transfer number to serve as a chemical barrier against the shuttle effect. Between the gel electrolyte and the cathode surface is a thin gradient solidification layer that enables transformation from gel to liquid so that the liquid electrolyte is maintained inside the cathode for rapid Li+ transport and high utilization of active materials. By addressing the dilemma between the shuttle chemistry and incomplete discharge of S/Se, the new electrolyte configuration demonstrates its feasibility to trigger higher capacity retention of the cathodes. As a result, Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se cells with high energy and long cycle lives are realized, showing promise for practical use.

By addressing the dilemma between the shuttle chemistry and incomplete discharge of S/Se, the new electrolyte configuration demonstrates its feasibility to trigger higher capacity retention of the cathodes. As a result, Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se cells with high energy and long cycle lives are realized, showing promise for practical use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High Phase Stability in CsPbI3 Enabled by Pb&#8211;I Octahedra Anchors for Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
CsPbI3 inorganic perovskite exhibits some special unique properties including crystal structure distortion and quantum confinement effect, yet the poor phase stability severely hinders its application. The nature of the photoactive CsPbI3 phase transition from the perspective of PbI6 octahedral rotation is revealed and a facile method to simultaneously stabilize the photo&#8208;active phase and reduce the defect density of CsPbI3 is developed.








Abstract
CsPbI3 inorganic perovskite has exhibited some special properties particularly crystal structure distortion and quantum confinement effect, yet the poor phase stability of CsPbI3 severely hinders its applications. Herein, the nature of the photoactive CsPbI3 phase transition from the perspective of PbI6 octahedra is revealed. A facile method is also developed to stabilize the photoactive phase and to reduce the defect density of CsPbI3. CsPbI3 is decorated with multifunctional 4&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (ABA), and steric neostigmine bromide (NGBr) is subsequently used to further mediate the thin films' surface (NGBr&#8208;CsPbI3(ABA)). The ABA or NG cation adsorbed onto the grain boundaries/surface of CsPbI3 anchors the PbI6 octahedra via increasing the energy barriers of octahedral rotation, which maintains the continuous array of corner&#8208;sharing PbI6 octahedra and kinetically stabilizes the photoactive phase CsPbI3. Moreover, the added ABA and NGBr not only interact with shallow&#8208; or deep&#8208;level defects in CsPbI3 to significantly reduce defect density, but also lead to improved energy&#8208;level alignment at the interfaces between the CsPbI3 and the charge transport layers. Finally, the champion NGBr&#8208;CsPbI3(ABA)&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cell delivers 18.27% efficiency with excellent stability. Overall, this work demonstrates a promising concept to achieve highly phase&#8208;stabilized inorganic perovskite with suppressed defect density for promoting its optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Multifunctional Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings for Perishable Fruits</title>
      <dc:description>
A conformal bio&#8208;nanocomposite coating based on cellulose nanocrystals and poly(albumen) is developed that increases the shelf&#8208;life of fresh produce by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial attack. The coating is edible, easily washable, and made from readily available inexpensive materials, which makes it a promising solution to combat food wastage.








Abstract
Hunger and chronic undernourishment impact over 800 million people, which translates to &#8776;10.7% of the world's population. While countries are increasingly making efforts to reduce poverty and hunger by pursuing sustainable energy and agricultural practices, a third of the food produced around the globe still is wasted and never consumed. Reducing food shortages is vital in this effort and is often addressed by the development of genetically modified produce or chemical additives and inedible coatings, which create additional health and environmental concerns. Herein, a multifunctional bio&#8208;nanocomposite comprised largely of egg&#8208;derived polymers and cellulose nanomaterials as a conformal coating onto fresh produce that slows down food decay by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial invasion is reported. The coating is edible, washable, and made from readily available inexpensive or waste materials, which makes it a promising economic alternative to commercially available fruit coatings and a solution to combat food wastage that is rampant in the world.

      <title>Gadolinium&#8211;Rose Bengal Coordination Polymer Nanodots for MR&#8208;/Fluorescence&#8208;Image&#8208;Guided Radiation and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Gadolinium&#8211;rose bengal coordination polymer nanodots exhibit enhanced dual&#8208;modal imaging, as well as significant increase of singlet oxygen generation and radiosensitization over free rose bengal. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation therapy (RT) more significantly inhibits tumor growth than monotherapies (i.e., PDT or RT).








Abstract
Combination therapy based on nanomedicine has gained momentum in oncology in recent years, offering superior safety and efficacy over monotherapies. It is critical to design theranostics that are composed of imaging and therapeutic agents already approved. Herein, gadolinium (Gd)&#8211;rose bengal coordination polymer nanodots (GRDs) are reported. The GRDs exhibit a unique absorption property and 7.7&#8208;fold luminescence enhancement, as well as a 1.9&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency over free rose bengal. Meanwhile, GRDs exhibit a twofold increase in r1 relaxivity over gadopentetic acid (Gd&#8208;DTPA) and have better X&#8208;ray absorption ability than rose bengal alone. These excellent properties of the GRDs are verified both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation therapy (RT) more significantly inhibits tumor growth than monotherapies (i.e., PDT or RT). This work offers a new route to designing and synthesizing Gd&#8208;based nanotheranostics for image&#8208;guided cancer therapy.

      <title>Anisotropy of Charge Transport in a Uniaxially Aligned Fused Electron&#8208;Deficient Polymer Processed by Solution Shear Coating</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive charge transport characterization of two rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymers that do not contain single bonds in their backbones is presented.

Abstract
Precise control of the microstructure in organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic electronic devices. Here, a comprehensive charge transport characterization of two recently reported rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymers that do not contain single bonds in the main chain is reported. It is demonstrated that the molecular design of the polymer makes it possible to achieve an extended linear backbone structure, which can be directly visualized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The rigid structure of the polymers allows the formation of thin films with uniaxially aligned polymer chains by using a simple one&#8208;step solution&#8208;shear/bar coating technique. These aligned films show a high optical anisotropy with a dichroic ratio of up to a factor of 6. Transport measurements performed using top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect transistors exhibit a high saturation electron mobility of 0.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 along the alignment direction, which is more than six times higher than the value reported in the previous work. This work demonstrates that this new class of polymers is able to achieve mobility values comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type polymers and identifies an effective processing strategy for this class of rigid&#8208;rod polymer system to optimize their charge transport properties.

      <title>Sustainable Fuel Production from Ambient Moisture via Ferroelectrically Driven MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Negatively polarized BaTiO3 (BTO)@MoS2, positively polarized BTO@MoS2, and a hydrogel serve as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte for a humidity digester. The hydrogel harvests humidity from humid air and transfers the collected water to surface of the electrodes. Under the well&#8208;tuned polarization, the vector of the built&#8208;in electric field in the ferroelectric can be controlled, and therefore drive enhanced atmospheric humidity splitting for dehumidification and fuel production.








Abstract
Unlike traditional water splitting in an aqueous medium, direct decomposition of atmospheric water is a promising way to simultaneously dehumidify the living space and generate power. Here, a tailored superhygroscopic hydrogel, a catalyst, and a solar cell are integrated into a humidity digester that can break down ambient moisture into hydrogen and oxygen, creating an efficient electrochemical cell. The function of the hydrogel is to harvest moisture from ambient humidity and transfer the collected water to the catalyst. Barium titanate and vertical 2D MoS2 nanosheets are integrated as the catalyst: the negatively polarized cathode can enhance the electron transport and attract H+ to the MoS2 surface for water reduction, while water oxidation takes place at the positively polarized anode. By employing this mechanism, it is possible to maintain the relative humidity in a medium&#8208;sized room at &lt;60% without any additional energy input, and a stable current of 12.5 mA cm&#8722;2 is generated by the humidity digester when exposed to ambient light.

The function of the hydrogel is to harvest moisture from ambient humidity and transfer the collected water to the catalyst. Barium titanate and vertical 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are integrated as the catalyst: the negatively polarized cathode can enhance the electron transport and attract H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface for water reduction, while water oxidation takes place at the positively polarized anode. By employing this mechanism, it is possible to maintain the relative humidity in a medium&#8208;sized room at &amp;lt;60% without any additional energy input, and a stable current of 12.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is generated by the humidity digester when exposed to ambient light.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tuning the Anode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface Chemistry for Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Li3PO4&#8208;infused Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 via atomic layer deposition with simple annealing is demonstrated to have excellent moisture stability and interfacial stability to a lithium anode by presenting negligible interfacial resistance (&#8776;1 &#937; cm2) and a record&#8208;high critical current density of 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 at ambient conditions. This new surface/subsurface engineering approach stabilizes the anode&#8211;electrolyte interface for solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is a promising candidate as the anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state batteries. However, interface issues, including large interfacial resistance and the generation of Li dendrites, have always frustrated the attempt to commercialize solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). Here, it is reported that infusing garnet&#8208;type solid electrolytes (GSEs) with the air&#8208;stable electrolyte Li3PO4 (LPO) dramatically reduces the interfacial resistance to &#8776;1 &#937; cm2 and achieves a high critical current density of 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions due to the enhanced interfacial stability to the Li metal anode. The coated and infused LPO electrolytes not only improve the mechanical strength and Li&#8208;ion conductivity of the grain boundaries, but also form a stable Li&#8208;ion conductive but electron&#8208;insulating LPO&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase between the Li metal and the GSE. Consequently, the growth of Li dendrites is eliminated and the direct reduction of the GSE by Li metal over a long cycle life is prevented. This interface engineering approach together with grain&#8208;boundary modification on GSEs represents a promising strategy to revolutionize the anode&#8211;electrolyte interface chemistry for SSLBs and provides a new design strategy for other types of solid&#8208;state batteries.

      <title>An Ir/Ni(OH)2 Heterostructured Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Breaking the Scaling Relation, Stabilizing Iridium(V), and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured electrocatalyst is designed for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The heterointerface not only stabilizes the metastable electrophilic Ir(V) species but also breaks the scaling relation, thereby substantially promoting the OER kinetics. The results highlight the significance of heterostructure interface engineering toward the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the OER and beyond.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly challenging for hydrogen production from water splitting, due to the high energy barrier for O&#63743;O bond formation and the restriction of the scaling relation between the multiple reaction intermediates. In order to simultaneously address these concerns, an Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces is deliberately designed as an efficient electrocatalyst system, with Ir nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously confined on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The strong electronic interaction and chemical bonding across the interface between the Ir and Ni(OH)2 can effectively stabilize the metastable electrophilic Ir(V) species, which is vital to boost the formation of O&#63743;O bonds. Meanwhile, the adsorption of the multiple intermediates is synergistically optimized at the heterointerface, which breaks the restrictive scaling relation and substantially accelerates the OER kinetics. In addition, the severe agglomeration of Ir species is greatly mitigated by the confinement effect, ensuring the structural integrity of the catalyst and the constant exposure of active sites. Owing to its well&#8208;defined multifunctional interfaces, the Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure exhibits exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline media. The present results highlight the significance of heterostructure interface engineering toward the rational design and development of advanced electrocatalysts for the OER and beyond.

      <title>Tellurium: A High&#8208;Volumetric&#8208;Capacity Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) is demonstrated to be a promising electrode material for storage of K+ ions via a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction mechanism of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te. A rationally designed tellurium/porous carbon composited electrode that can alleviate the volume change and shuttle effect shows a high volumetric capacity as well as high rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance.








Abstract
Currently, exploring high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de&#8208;)insertion of large&#8208;size K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium&#8208;/sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K&#8211;Te battery is constructed, and the K+&#8208;ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm&#8722;3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high&#8208;rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 15 C, and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.

      <title>Intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; Conjugation Self&#8208;Assembly to Stabilize Surface Passivation of Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Sufficient and stable surface passivation of perovskite solar cells is realized using a novel tribenzylphosphine oxide molecule, with high cell efficiency of &gt;22% and excellent operation stability being obtained. These achievements benefit from the strong molecule&#8211;perovskite Coulomb interaction and the formation of superstructure self&#8208;assembly on the perovskite surface, enabled by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective approach to eliminate defects and thus to achieve efficient perovskite solar cells, while the stability of the passivation effect is a new concern for device stability engineering. Herein, tribenzylphosphine oxide (TBPO) is introduced to stably passivate the perovskite surface. A high efficiency exceeding 22%, with steady&#8208;state efficiency of 21.6%, is achieved, which is among the highest performances for TiO2 planar cells, and the hysteresis is significantly suppressed. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the surface molecule superstructure induced by TBPO intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, such as the periodic interconnected structure, results in a high stability of TBPO&#8211;perovskite coordination and passivation. The passivated cell exhibits significantly improved stability, with sustaining 92% of initial efficiency after 250 h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking. Therefore, the construction of a stabilized surface passivation in this work represents great progress in the stability engineering of perovskite solar cells.

      <title>A 2D Titanium Carbide MXene Flexible Electrode for High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed transparent conducting electrode with desirable properties including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 668 S cm&#8722;1) and work function (&#8776;5.1 eV) is achieved by using a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene thin film. Precise control of the surface chemical composition and a neutralized hole&#8208;injection layer prevent detrimental surface/interface oxidation of the MXene and enable a high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diode that uses the solution&#8208;processed MXene electrode.








Abstract
Although several transparent conducting materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conducting polymers have been intensively explored as flexible electrodes in optoelectronic devices, their insufficient electrical conductivity, low work function, and complicated electrode fabrication processes have limited their practical use. Herein, a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene film with transparent conducting electrode (TCE) properties, including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 670 S cm&#8722;1) and high work function (&#8776;5.1 eV), which are achieved by combining a simple solution processing with modulation of surface composition, is described. A chemical neutralization strategy of a conducting&#8208;polymer hole&#8208;injection layer is used to prevent detrimental surface oxidation and resulting degradation of the electrode film. Use of the MXene electrode in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode leads to a current efficiency of &#8776;102.0 cd A&#8722;1 and an external quantum efficiency of &#8776;28.5% ph/el, which agree well with the theoretical maximum values from optical simulations. The results demonstrate the strong potential of MXene as a solution&#8208;processable electrode in optoelectronic devices and provide a guideline for use of MXenes as TCEs in low&#8208;cost flexible optoelectronic devices.

     alt="A 2D Titanium Carbide MXene Flexible Electrode for High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution&#8208;processed transparent conducting electrode with desirable properties including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 668 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and work function (&#8776;5.1 eV) is achieved by using a 2D titanium carbide (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) MXene thin film. Precise control of the surface chemical composition and a neutralized hole&#8208;injection layer prevent detrimental surface/interface oxidation of the MXene and enable a high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diode that uses the solution&#8208;processed MXene electrode.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although several transparent conducting materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conducting polymers have been intensively explored as flexible electrodes in optoelectronic devices, their insufficient electrical conductivity, low work function, and complicated electrode fabrication processes have limited their practical use. Herein, a 2D titanium carbide (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) MXene film with transparent conducting electrode (TCE) properties, including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 670 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high work function (&#8776;5.1 eV), which are achieved by combining a simple solution processing with modulation of surface composition, is described. A chemical neutralization strategy of a conducting&#8208;polymer hole&#8208;injection layer is used to prevent detrimental surface oxidation and resulting degradation of the electrode film. Use of the MXene electrode in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode leads to a current efficiency of &#8776;102.0 cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an external quantum efficiency of &#8776;28.5% ph/el, which agree well with the theoretical maximum values from optical simulations. The results demonstrate the strong potential of MXene as a solution&#8208;processable electrode in optoelectronic devices and provide a guideline for use of MXenes as TCEs in low&#8208;cost flexible optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heavy Water Additive in Formamidinium: A Novel Approach to Enhance Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Deuterium oxide as a solvent additive enhances the power conversion efficiency of triple&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells. It passivates the defects, thus enhancing the charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths. Partial formamidinium deuteration also helps to stabilize the PbI6 structure. This facile approach based on selective isotope exchange could possibly be extended to other perovskite devices to improve their optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Heavy water or deuterium oxide (D2O) comprises deuterium, a hydrogen isotope twice the mass of hydrogen. Contrary to the disadvantages of deuterated perovskites, such as shorter recombination lifetimes and lower/invariant efficiencies, the serendipitous effect of D2O as a beneficial solvent additive for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of triple&#8208;A cation (cesium (Cs)/methylammonium (MA)/formaminidium (FA)) perovskite solar cells from &#8776;19.2% (reference) to 20.8% (using 1 vol% D2O) with higher stability is reported. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirms passivation of trap states, increased carrier recombination lifetimes, and enhanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in the deuterated samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy validate the N&#8211;H2 group as the preferential isotope exchange site. Furthermore, the NMR results reveal the induced alteration of the FA to MA ratio due to deuteration causes a widespread alteration to several dynamic processes that influence the photophysical properties. First&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations reveal a decrease in PbI6 phonon frequencies in the deuterated perovskite lattice. This stabilizes the PbI6 structures and weakens the electron&#8211;LO phonon (Fr&#246;hlich) coupling, yielding higher electron mobility. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that selective isotope exchange potentially opens new opportunities for tuning perovskite optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Efficient Luminogens with AIE Features for Three&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Imaging of the Brain through the Intact Skull</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrabright solid&#8208;state FR/NIR luminogen with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature is reported. Its resulting AIE dots show good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and a large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section. The AIE dots are reported for visualization of the cerebral thrombosis process of a mouse with intact skull, with high penetration depth and good image contrast.








Abstract
Visualization of the brain in its native environment is important for understanding common brain diseases. Herein, bright luminogens with remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics and high quantum yields of up to 42.6% in the solid state are synthesized through facile reaction routes. The synthesized molecule, namely BTF, shows ultrabright far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared emission and can be fabricated into AIE dots by a simple nanoprecipitation procedure. Due to their high brightness, large Stokes shift, good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section, the AIE dots can be utilized as efficient fluorescent nanoprobes for in vivo brain vascular imaging through the intact skull by a three&#8208;photon fluorescence microscopy imaging technique. This is the first example of using AIE dots for the visualization of the cerebral stroke process through the intact skull of a mouse with high penetration depth and good image contrast. Such good results are anticipated to open up a new venue in the development of efficient emitters with strong nonlinear optical effects for noninvasive bioimaging of living brain.

      <title>An Ultrastrong and Highly Stretchable Polyurethane Elastomer Enabled by a Zipper&#8208;Like Ring&#8208;Sliding Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A molecular zipper elastomer&#8212;the combination of ring&#8208;sliding effects and dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding crystal domains in a dry polymer network&#8212;results in unexpectedly substantial improvements to the elastomer mechanical performance, including stretchability and strength. The mechanism is found to be the ring&#8208;sliding motion against hydrogen&#8208;bonding domains upon stretching, which effectively dissipates the input mechanical energy.








Abstract
Elastomers with excellent mechanical properties are in substantial demand for various applications, but there is always a tradeoff between their mechanical strength and stretchability. For example, partially replacing strong covalent crosslinking by weak sacrificial bonds can enhance the stretchability but also usually decreases the mechanical strength. To surmount this inherent tradeoff, a supramolecular strategy of introducing a zipper&#8208;like sliding&#8208;ring mechanism in a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane network is proposed. A very small amount (0.5 mol%) of an external additive (pseudo[2]rotaxane crosslinker) can dramatically increase both the mechanical strength and elongation of this polyurethane network by nearly one order of magnitude. Based on the investigation of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties, this enhancement is attributable to a unique molecular&#8208;level zipper&#8208;like ring&#8208;sliding motion, which efficiently dissipates mechanical work in the solvent&#8208;free network. This research not only provides a distinct and general strategy for the construction of high&#8208;performance elastomers but also paves the way for the practical application of artificial molecular machines toward solvent&#8208;free polyurethane networks.

      <title>Phosphonium Modification Leads to Ultrapermeable Antibacterial Polyamide Composite Membranes with Unreduced Thickness</title>
      <dc:description>
Facile modification of polyamide composite membranes by an inexpensive phosphonium monomer featuring tetrahedral geometry is found to create additional water transport channels, improving the water purification performance without reducing film thickness. Compared with cutting&#8208;edge ultrathin membranes, the modified membrane highlights good rejection, antibacterial properties, superior water permeability, and facile preparation.








Abstract
Water transport rate in network membranes is inversely correlated to thickness, thus superior permeance is achievable with ultrathin membranes prepared by complicated methods circumventing nanofilm weakness and defects. Conferring ultrahigh permeance to easily prepared thicker membranes remains challenging. Here, a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) monomer is discovered that enables straightforward modification of polyamide composite membranes. Water permeance of the modified membrane is &#8776;6 times improved, give rising to permeability (permeance &#215; thickness) one magnitude higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer nanofiltration membranes. Meanwhile, the membrane exhibits good rejection (RNa2SO4 = 98%) and antibacterial properties under crossflow conditions. THPC modification not only improves membrane hydrophilicity, but also creates additional angstrom&#8208;scale channels in polyamide membranes for unimpeded transport of water. This unique mechanism provides a paradigm shift in facile preparation of ultrapermeable membranes with unreduced thickness for clean water and desalination.

      <title>A New Microengineered Platform for 4D Tracking of Single Cells in a Stem&#8208;Cell&#8208;Based In Vitro Morphogenesis Model</title>
      <dc:description>
Several stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based morphogenesis models mimicking embryonic development have been recently developed; however, customized cell culture platforms are needed to unleash their full potential. A new, microengineered platform for 3D suspension culture of mouse stem cell aggregates is presented; enabling microscale control of the position and orientation of elongating stem cell aggregates and real&#8208;time data acquisition at single&#8208;cell resolution.








Abstract
Recently developed stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based in vitro models of morphogenesis can help shed light on the mechanisms involved in embryonic patterning. These models are showcased using traditional cell culture platforms and materials, which allow limited control over the biological system and usually do not support high&#8208;content imaging. In contrast, using advanced microengineered tools can help in microscale control, long&#8208;term culture, and real&#8208;time data acquisition from such biological models and aid in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, a new culturing, manipulation and analysis platform is described to study in vitro morphogenesis using thin polycarbonate film&#8208;based microdevices. A pipeline consisting of open&#8208;source software to quantify 3D cell movement using 4D image acquisition is developed to analyze cell migration within the multicellular clusters. It is shown that the platform can be used to control and study morphogenesis in non&#8208;adherent cultures of the P19C5 mouse stem cell line and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that show symmetry breaking and axial elongation events similar to early embryonic development. Using the new platform, it is found that localized cell proliferation and coordinated cell migration result in elongation morphogenesis of the P19C5 aggregates. Further, it is found that polarization and elongation of mESC aggregates are dependent on directed cell migration.

A new, microengineered platform for 3D suspension culture of mouse stem cell aggregates is presented; enabling microscale control of the position and orientation of elongating stem cell aggregates and real&#8208;time data acquisition at single&#8208;cell resolution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently developed stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based in vitro models of morphogenesis can help shed light on the mechanisms involved in embryonic patterning. These models are showcased using traditional cell culture platforms and materials, which allow limited control over the biological system and usually do not support high&#8208;content imaging. In contrast, using advanced microengineered tools can help in microscale control, long&#8208;term culture, and real&#8208;time data acquisition from such biological models and aid in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, a new culturing, manipulation and analysis platform is described to study in vitro morphogenesis using thin polycarbonate film&#8208;based microdevices. A pipeline consisting of open&#8208;source software to quantify 3D cell movement using 4D image acquisition is developed to analyze cell migration within the multicellular clusters. It is shown that the platform can be used to control and study morphogenesis in non&#8208;adherent cultures of the P19C5 mouse stem cell line and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that show symmetry breaking and axial elongation events similar to early embryonic development. Using the new platform, it is found that localized cell proliferation and coordinated cell migration result in elongation morphogenesis of the P19C5 aggregates. Further, it is found that polarization and elongation of mESC aggregates are dependent on directed cell migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalyst of F&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon toward N2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A F&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) is developed as a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves a yield rate of 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1 for NH3, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of the reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts up to date.








Abstract
N2 electroreduction into NH3 represents an attractive prospect for N2 utilization. Nevertheless, this process suffers from low Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield rate for NH3. In this work, a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst is developed by introducing F atoms into a 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves the highest FE of 54.8% for NH3, which is 3.0 times as high as that (18.3%) of pristine carbon frameworks. Notably, at &#8722;0.3 V versus RHE, the yield rate of F&#8208;doped carbon for NH3 reaches 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1. Such a value is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of other metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts under the near&#8208;ambient conditions for NH3 product to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that the improved performance in N2 electroreduction for F&#8208;doped carbon originates from the enhanced binding strength of N2 and the facilitated dissociation of N2 into *N2H. F bonding to C atom creates a Lewis acid site due to the different electronegativity between the F and C atoms. As such, the repulsive interaction between the Lewis acid site and proton H suppresses the activity of H2 evolution reaction, thus enhancing the selectivity of N2 electroreduction into NH3.

      <title>Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregates: A New Class of Bioinspired Materials Merging an Interfacial Anchor with Antifouling</title>
      <dc:description>
Few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way. The preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of bovine serum albumin (PTB) is reported, showing strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, as well as excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of biological contaminants.








Abstract
Surfaces that resist nonspecific protein adsorption in a complex biological milieu are required for a variety of applications. However, few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way, regardless of material type, morphology, and shape. Herein, the preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous supramolecular assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is reported. Based on fast amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation through the rapid reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of BSA by tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine, a dense proteinaceous nanofilm with controllable thickness (&#8776;130 nm) can be covered on virtually arbitrary material surfaces in tens of minutes by a simple dipping or spraying. The nanofilm shows strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, exhibiting excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of contaminants including proteins, serum, cell lysate, cells, and microbes, etc. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the nanofilm can prevent the adhesion of microorganisms and the formation of biofilm. Compared with native BSA, the proteinaceous nanofilm coating exposes a variety of functional groups on the surface, which have more&#8208;stable adhesion with the surface and can maintain the antifouling in harsh conditions including under ultrasound, surfactants, organic solvents, and enzymatic digestion.

      <title>Defect&#8208;Enhanced Polarization Switching in the Improper Ferroelectric LuFeO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Polarization switching in epitaxial thin films of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 shows that the inclusion of point defects can reduce the coercive electric field. Frequency dispersion of the switching field is larger when the thickness is reduced, suggesting that the mechanical constraint induced by the substrates may play a key role in the switching of the polarization state.








Abstract
Results of switching behavior of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 are presented. Using a model set of films prepared under controlled chemical and growth&#8208;rate conditions, it is shown that defects can reduce the quasi&#8208;static switching voltage by up to 40% in qualitative agreement with first&#8208;principles calculations. Switching studies show that the coercive field has a stronger frequency dispersion for the improper ferroelectrics compared to a proper ferroelectric such as PbTiO3. It is concluded that the primary structural order parameter controls the switching dynamics of such improper ferroelectrics.

      <title>A Noble&#8208;Transition Alloy Excels at Hot&#8208;Carrier Generation in the Near Infrared</title>

A noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, is demonstrated to excel at generating above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8220; carriers under near&#8208;infrared excitation. Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd.








Abstract
Above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8208;carrier generation in metals is a promising route to convert photons into electrical charge for efficient near&#8208;infrared optoelectronics. However, metals that offer both hot&#8208;carrier generation in the near&#8208;infrared and sufficient carrier lifetimes remain elusive. Alloys can offer emergent properties and new design strategies compared to pure metals. Here, it is shown that a noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, outperforms its constituent metals concerning generation and lifetime of hot carriers when excited in the near&#8208;infrared. At optical fiber wavelengths (e.g., 1550 nm), Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd.

      <title>Living Bioelectrochemical Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Combining Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with the self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K leads to conductive networks that allow transfer of extracellular electron equivalents to an external gold electrode. It is shown that three&#8208;dimensional living biocomposites incorporating electrogenic bacteria and conductive gels efficiently harvest biocurrent, providing a strategy to reduce barriers to charge extraction and injection in bioelectrochemical devices.








Abstract
Composites, in which two or more material elements are combined to provide properties unattainable by single components, have a historical record dating to ancient times. Few include a living microbial community as a key design element. A logical basis for enabling bioelectronic composites stems from the phenomenon that certain microorganisms transfer electrons to external surfaces, such as an electrode. A bioelectronic composite that allows cells to be addressed beyond the confines of an electrode surface can impact bioelectrochemical technologies, including microbial fuel cells for power production and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where microbes produce desired chemicals. It is shown that the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K functions as a conductive matrix to electronically connect a three&#8208;dimensional network of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 to a gold electrode, thereby increasing biocurrent &#8776;150&#8208;fold over control biofilms. These biocomposites spontaneously assemble from solution into an intricate arrangement of cells within a conductive polymer matrix. While increased biocurrent is due to more cells in communication with the electrode, the current extracted per cell is also enhanced, indicating efficient long&#8208;range electron transport. Further, the biocomposites show almost an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude lower charge transfer resistance than CPE&#8208;K alone, supporting the idea that the electroactive bacteria and the conjugated polyelectrolyte work synergistically toward an effective bioelectronic composite.

&lt;p&gt;Combining &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR&#8208;1 with the self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K leads to conductive networks that allow transfer of extracellular electron equivalents to an external gold electrode. It is shown that three&#8208;dimensional living biocomposites incorporating electrogenic bacteria and conductive gels efficiently harvest biocurrent, providing a strategy to reduce barriers to charge extraction and injection in bioelectrochemical devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composites, in which two or more material elements are combined to provide properties unattainable by single components, have a historical record dating to ancient times. Few include a living microbial community as a key design element. A logical basis for enabling bioelectronic composites stems from the phenomenon that certain microorganisms transfer electrons to external surfaces, such as an electrode. A bioelectronic composite that allows cells to be addressed beyond the confines of an electrode surface can impact bioelectrochemical technologies, including microbial fuel cells for power production and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where microbes produce desired chemicals. It is shown that the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K functions as a conductive matrix to electronically connect a three&#8208;dimensional network of &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR&#8208;1 to a gold electrode, thereby increasing biocurrent &#8776;150&#8208;fold over control biofilms. These biocomposites spontaneously assemble from solution into an intricate arrangement of cells within a conductive polymer matrix. While increased biocurrent is due to more cells in communication with the electrode, the current extracted per cell is also enhanced, indicating efficient long&#8208;range electron transport. Further, the biocomposites show almost an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude lower charge transfer resistance than CPE&#8208;K alone, supporting the idea that the electroactive bacteria and the conjugated polyelectrolyte work synergistically toward an effective bioelectronic composite.&lt;/p&gt;
