         <title>Anisotropic Optoelectronic Synapses in 2D Nb2GeTe4 for Direction&#8208;Programmable Neuromorphic Perception and Decision&#8208;Making</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck. Using anisotropic 2D Nb2GeTe4, dual electronic&#8208;optical synapses with directional plasticity are developed: 98.3% accuracy along a&#8208;axis vs 88.3% along b&#8208;axis under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation. This enables compact neuromorphic hardware with co&#8208;stimulation processing, demonstrated in high&#8208;accuracy machine vision (89.6%) and vehicle navigation (90.2%). It advances multimodal sensing for edge AI and robotics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing presents a promising solution for the von Neumann bottleneck, enabling energy&#8208;efficient and intelligent sensing platforms. Although 2D materials are ideal for bioinspired neuromorphic devices, achieving multifunctional synaptic operations with simple configurations and linear weight updates remains challenging. Inspired by biological axons, the in&#8208;plane anisotropy of 2D Nb2GeTe4 is exploited to develop dual electronic&#8208;optical synaptic devices. The device exhibits anisotropic hole mobilities (137.97 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the a&#8208;axis and 78.29 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the b&#8208;axis) and a wavelength&#8208;dependent photoresponse. This enables directional synaptic plasticity under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation, achieving 98.3% accuracy along the a&#8208;axis and 88.3% along the b&#8208;axis in adaptive image processing. A machine vision system with 89.6% object recognition accuracy and an intelligent vehicle navigation platform with 90.2% decision&#8208;making accuracy is also demonstrated. The integration of anisotropic transport and spectrally tunable responses in a single material paves the way for compact neuromorphic hardware with multimodal sensing and parallel processing capabilities. This study advances 2D material&#8208;based neuroelectronics for edge computing, autonomous robotics, and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Polarized Luminescence in Halide Perovskite Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines polarized luminescence in halide perovskite nanomaterials, dissecting structural engineering strategies for the generation of LPL and chiral CPL. It analyzes chirality transfer via ligand functionalization, liquid crystal templating, and nanocrystal alignment, while evaluating performance through dissymmetry factors and quantum yield metrics. The integration of machine learning (ML) for predictive design, synthesis optimization, and structure&#8208;property elucidation is highlighted.









Abstract
Halide perovskite nanomaterials have emerged as a transformative platform for generating and manipulating polarized luminescence, offering unprecedented opportunities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in engineering both linearly polarized luminescence (LPL) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from perovskite nanostructures, focusing on structural design principles, chirality transfer mechanisms, and performance optimization strategies. Methods are systematically analyzed to achieve polarized emission, including anisotropic nanocrystal growth, chiral ligand functionalization, and liquid crystal&#8208;mediated alignment, while highlighting critical optical factors such as dissymmetry factors and photoluminescence quantum yield. Key challenges in enhancing the precision control over perovskite nanostructures, room&#8208;temperature CPL efficiency, and scalable assembly are discussed, with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate progress in the development of perovskite nanomaterials with customized polarized luminescence. By bridging fundamental insights with technological applications, this review outlines a roadmap for developing perovskite&#8208;based polarized light sources that combine high performance, stability, and manufacturability, which are key enablers for the future of quantum photonics, ultra&#8208;secure communication, and intelligent optical systems.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Ultra&#8208;Thin p&#8208;Type BiCuSeO Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D BiCuSeO films, grown using molecular beam epitaxy, demonstrate a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Intrinsic ferroelectric transitions have been uncovered through piezoelectric force microscopy signals, which exhibit typical butterfly curves in amplitude and 180&#176; phase switching. This is further corroborated by the processes involved in writing and reading ferroelectric domains within the BiCuSeO films.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, where polarization switching transpires within the channel material itself, are pivotal to advancing the next generation of high&#8208;performance electronics. Nevertheless, the challenge remains in either the controllable synthesis of films or the manipulation of associated ferroelectricity. Here, 2D p&#8208;type BiCuSeO (BCSO) films with a thickness down to &#8776;3 nm are successfully synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. The room&#8208;temperature (RT) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy, showing robust ferroelectric switching capability. Insights derived from density functional theory, coupled with the ferroelectric dipole map in cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images, suggest that the polar displacement of [CuSe] layers under electric fields primarily contributes to ferroelectricity in the BCSO film. Furthermore, the switching behavior of the BCSO&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junction has been clarified, exhibiting distinct ON and OFF states. Our results illustrate that such an ultrathin RT ferroelectric semiconductor could serve as a versatile material for future multifunctional electronic devices.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Emission From Single Chiral Hedgehog Particles Coated with Nanofilms of Achiral Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) is observed from chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) coated with a nanofilm of achiral perovskite, with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskites and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Careful analysis of optical activity indicates that the CPLE of perovskite luminescence is dominated by post&#8208;emission scattering from the chiral surfaces of the same CHIPs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are known for their strong and tunable luminescence. However, the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;based particles with circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) remains challenging due to the complex interplay of metal&#8208;ligand chemistries, crystallization patterns, and chirality transfer mechanisms. Achiral perovskites can be deposited on chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) with twisted spikes, producing chiroptically active materials with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskite and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed CPLE is engineered into complex particles comprised of a layer of perovskite deposited onto CHIPs coated with an intermediate silica layer. The spectral position of chiroptical bands, the optical asymmetry g&#8208;factors, and single&#8208;particle circularly polarized microscopy indicate that the observed CPLE is dominated by the post&#8208;emission scattering from the twisted spikes of the parent particle. Templating luminescent nanofilms on CHIPs provides a simple pathway to a wide range of complex chiroptical materials; the dispersibility of the CHIPs in various solvents and the tunability of their chiral geometry enable their applications as single&#8208;particle emitters with strong and controllable polarization rotation.

         <title>Sn4+&#8208;Mediated Trap Engineering in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Titanate Nanophosphors Enables Self&#8208;Sustained Multimodal Imaging and Combinatorial Oncotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research utilisation of the Sn4+&#8208;Mediated trap engineering dramatically enhanced the Cr3+&#8208;Activated Titanate phosphors near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence. Sub&#8208;100 nm nano&#8208;phosphor with superior multimodal imaging capacity are synthesized via coprecipitation&#8208;solid&#8208;state calcination. Subsequent surface modification of anticancer drugs established an efficient theranostic nanoplatform for anticancer therapy, integrating efficient drug delivery and safe real&#8208;time tracking capabilities.








Abstract
Multimodal imaging provides comprehensive and precise tools that significantly increase the efficiency and accuracy in clinical decision&#8208;making. The integration of superior multimodal imaging capabilities with stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release functionalities within a single nanoplatform holds crucial promise for both scientific exploration and clinical translation but remains a formidable challenge in advancing precision medicine. The unique integration of near&#8208;infrared emission (&#955;em = 760 nm), multiwavelength&#8208;rechargeable afterglow, photostimulated luminescence under 980 nm excitation, and Gd3&#8314;&#8208;specific ferromagnetism is highlighted in Na0.5Gd0.5TiO3:Cr3+,Sn4+ phosphor. By doping with Sn4+, a threefold enhancement in the luminescent performance is achieved, demonstrating a 1.37&#8208;fold increase in initial afterglow brightness and extending the persistent luminescence duration to over 15 h. Uniform cubic long&#8208;persistent luminescent nano&#8208;phosphor Na0.5Gd0.5TiO3:Cr3+,Sn4+ with sub 100 nm dimensions are synthesized by coprecipitation. Following SiO2 surface functionalization, it showed sustained luminescence exceeding 2.5 h under UV charging, as validated by in vivo murine imaging. Notably, &#8776;2 h of imaging can still be achieved in mice under blue light charging. A theragnostics nanoplatform is developed by conjugating drugs onto the exterior of SiO2, achieving &#8776;50% bactericidal and antitumour effects, endowing the system with integrated antibacterial&#8208;antitumour efficacy, thereby establishing a multifunctional capability for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Direct Lithium Extraction from Low&#8208;Quality Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes the structure&#8208;efficiency&#8208;application framework of solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems for lithium extraction from low&#8208;quality brines. It highlights fundamental mechanisms, integrated design, engineering applications, and device development of SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. The challenges and future perspective for the next generation of scale&#8208;up SDLE architectures are also supplemented.








Abstract
Owing to the crucial role in energy transformation for decarbonization, sustainable lithium (Li) supply has become growingly critical. Low&#8208;quality brines hold vast potential due to infinite reserves and diverse distribution but desire green and cost&#8208;effective extraction techniques against low Li concentrations and high magnesium&#8208;to&#8208;lithium ratios. Solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems combining conventional evaporation and DLE techniques can overcome the present challenges of Li extraction, promising to advance the exploitation of low&#8208;quality brines while simultaneously producing fresh water. However, the underlying construction principles and fundamental physical processes concerning SDLE systems are still uncovered comprehensively. This review first reveals the high&#8208;efficient and energy&#8208;effective Li extraction mechanisms from low&#8208;quality brines. Then, this work systematically presents construction and enhancement strategies, and the latest advancements and engineering applications of various SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. Furthermore, this work highlights the rational design of SDLE devices for water&#8208;Li co&#8208;production. Finally, this work discusses the challenges and future prospects for realizing SDLE systems from lab discovery to scale&#8208;up field demonstration. This review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and practical engineering behind the SDLE, unlocking different insights for resource sustainability and low&#8208;grade brines mining.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) enables the nanoscale mapping of electrostatic surface potentials. While widely applied in materials science, its use in biological systems remains emerging. This review presents recent advances in KPFM applied to biological samples and provides a critical perspective on current limitations and future directions for bio&#8208;nanoelectronic analysis.








Abstract
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a highly advanced technique offering notable surface sensitivity and high lateral resolution, ranging from micrometres to the sub&#8208;nanometre scale. This scanning probe technique effectively detects local electrical surface potential (ESP), influenced charge distribution, and work function differences, making it essential for studying biological and biochemical processes, from single molecules to complex cellular structures. By enabling nanometre&#8208;resolution analysis under simulated conditions, KPFM provides crucial insights into the physicochemical evolution, functionality, and structural organization of biomolecular systems. Recent advancements have significantly expanded KPFM's capabilities, revealing ESP characteristics in diverse biological entities, including single proteins, DNA strands, lipid films, fibrils, and complex neuronal structures. The technique also facilitates the study of biomolecular nanolayers on advanced nanomaterials like gold nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes, enhancing its role in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. Such versatility highlights KPFM's transformative potential in elucidating biomolecular interactions at unprecedented resolutions. This review critically analyses recent advancements, addresses ongoing challenges in measuring ESP in biological samples, and highlights emerging strategies to improve resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, KPFM's implications in diagnostics, biosensing, tissue engineering, therapeutics, drug screening, and Alzheimer's research are explored, establishing it as a powerful tool at the intersection of nanotechnology and biomedical innovation.

         <title>Inhalable Nanovaccine Based on Bioengineered Bacteria&#8208;Derived Membrane Vesicles Against Lung Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BMVax is an innovative inhalable nanovaccine crafted from bioengineered bacterial membrane vesicles expressing OVA257&#8208;264 antigen. Upon direct lung delivery, these vesicles are efficiently taken up by alveolar APCs, which then migrate to the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, initiating germinal center reactions, robust antigen&#8208;specific T and B cell responses, mucosal immunity, and the formation of lung tissue&#8208;resident memory T cell, collectively providing superior protection against lung metastasis.








Abstract
Lung metastases pose a challenge in cancer treatment due to the lung's vascular network and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conventional subcutaneous vaccines typically fail to elicit localized immune responses at metastatic sites. To address this, an inhalable nanovaccine, BMVax (bacterial membrane&#8208;based vaccine), is developed using bacterial membrane vesicles from engineered E. coli expressing ClyA&#8208;OVA257&#8208;264. Proteomics with retention of immunostimulatory membrane proteins, enabled efficient antigen co&#8208;delivery. BMVax ensured antigen cross&#8208;presentation (2.2&#8208;fold increase compared to the antigen + BMV mixture), driving robust antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell proliferation. Inhaling triggers strong immune responses in tracheobronchial lymph nodes, boosting germinal center B cells (&#8776;5.8&#8208;fold), follicular helper T cells (&#8776;4.9&#8208;fold), and mature dendritic cells (&#8776;2.5&#8208;fold), achieving 83.3% complete prevention of lung metastasis. In B16&#8208;OVA lung metastasis model, inhaled BMVax demonstrates superior tumor suppression compared to subcutaneous administration. It induces doubling germinal center B cells and 2.9&#8208;fold more follicular helper T cells in the lymph nodes, as well as 2.9&#8208;fold more antigen&#8208;specific T cells in lung tissue than subcutaneous immunization. Tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity and proliferation, reinforcing its therapeutic advantage over subcutaneous immunization. These findings highlight BMVax's potential as an inhalable cancer vaccine, capable of inducing strong immune responses, to effectively combat lung metastatic malignancies.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Fueled Time&#8208;Gated Luminescent Metamorphosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal precursor, NI&#8208;VD, undergoes chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogelation, autonomously shuttling between green and bright blue emissions. The transient hydrogel acts as a dynamic scaffold to perform the dual role of transforming the built&#8208;in fluorophore into an effective donor and temporarily entrapping external acceptors within close proximity of the donor to initiate F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) interactions, producing time&#8208;gated multicolor emission shuttles, which are translated to color&#8208;coded time&#8208;locked information encryption.








Abstract
Recent quest for emulating lifelike smart materials for developing functional outcomes has been spurred by the unparalleled spatiotemporal control of natural systems. However, it is still highly challenging to replicate the progressive time&#8208;dependent programmable features of biological systems, such as adaptive broad&#8208;spectrum luminescence accompanying functions. Here in, a chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogel is created based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active peptide conjugate (NI&#8208;VD). The fuel&#8208;driven anhydride formation, NI&#8208;VD&#8208;An, which results in transient hydrogelation and an evolution in emission from green to blue. The process's autonomous reversibility on successive anhydride hydrolysis over time enables the emission characteristics of the system to be dynamically modulated. Importantly, selective fluorophore trapping inside the chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogel network can achieve the programmable multicolor emission ranging from blue, green, white, yellow, red, and purple. For the first time, fuel&#8208;powered such an ephemeral hydrogel network potentially acts as a time&#8208;dependent donor in F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) processes toward the entrapped acceptors as well as a distance modulator of the donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, causing dynamic regulation of the emission properties. The exploration advances beyond the fundamental investigation of the transient hydrogel platform producing time&#8208;gated multicolor emission to the translation of spatiotemporal pattern development and precisely controlled time&#8208;coded information encryption.

For the first time, fuel-powered such an ephemeral hydrogel network potentially acts as a time-dependent donor in F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) processes toward the entrapped acceptors as well as a distance modulator of the donor-acceptor pairs, causing dynamic regulation of the emission properties. The exploration advances beyond the fundamental investigation of the transient hydrogel platform producing time-gated multicolor emission to the translation of spatiotemporal pattern development and precisely controlled time-coded information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Osmotic Energy Directly Driving Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State 2D Nanofluidic Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state iontronic pressure sensor is developed, which is directly driven by osmotic energy through a mechanically regulated 2D nanofluidic effect. By optimizing interlayer spacing, device geometry, and stacking design, the sensor achieves high voltage output, fast response, and robust stability. Integrated with deep learning, it enables accurate human&#8211;machine interaction using a single self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Current utilization of osmotic energy often involves multiple complex processes, including collection, storage, and conversion, which limits its applicability in portable electronic devices. Inspired by the biosensing system of human skin, a novel iontronic pressure sensor is developed, directly driven by osmotic energy. By leveraging the tunable nanofluidic effects of 2D materials, ion selective migration driven by osmotic energy is controlled through mechanical modulating of interlayer spacing, thereby converting external pressure into encodable electrical signals. In addition, the geometric configuration is optimized to further enhance the performance of the pressure sensor, achieving an ultrahigh output voltage (up to 13.10&#160;V), fast response/recovery time (115.0/128.0&#160;ms), and a wide pressure detection range (up to 360&#160;kPa). By integrating the deep learning algorithm with the sensor's excellent performance, high&#8208;resolution human&#8208;machine intelligent interaction is successfully demonstrated with 95.78% recognition accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for direct application of osmotic energy in real&#8208;world scenarios.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Driven Fabric for Synergistic Water&#8208;Electricity&#8208;Lithium Co&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaporation&#8208;driven fabric with triple&#8208;functional architecture synergistically enables water purification, hydrovoltaic energy harvesting, and lithium recovery through hierarchically structured ionic transport channels, resulting in a hydrovoltaic effects with a current density of 7.7&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, an evaporation rate of 1.42&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and lithimu adsorption of 40.87 mg m&#8722;2 in brine.








Abstract
Water evaporation constitutes a ubiquitous physical phenomenon. This natural process enables efficient energy and resource harvesting through water interacting with materials with tailored structural, chemical, and thermal properties. Here, this work designs an evaporation&#8208;driven fabric (e&#8208;fabric) that enables the utilization of water&#8208;electricity&#8208;lithium from brine through three optimized functional layers. Interfacial charge asymmetry between the carbon black (CB) photothermal layer and Al2O3 thermal insulation layer drives directional ion transport, generating sustained hydrovoltaic output with &#8776;7.7 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 current density. Under 1 kW m&#8722;2 sun irradiation, e&#8208;fabric demonstrates 1.42 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rate in brine while the Al2O3 layer reduces thermal dissipation. The middle protonated lithium titanate (HTO) adsorption layer selectively captures Li+ which achieves an adsorption capacity of 40.87 mg m&#8722;2 during a 2&#8208;h adsorption cycle while maintaining 93.2% recovery efficiency over 8 cycles. The decoupled operation of the adsorption process from the evaporation power generation system effectively prevents ion accumulation from affecting performance. This work can provide an approach for evaporation&#8208;driven water&#8208;electricity&#8208;lithium co&#8208;production systems.

         <title>The Formation of Supramolecular Rigid Glass Based on Transparent Deep Eutectic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the formation of traditional inorganic glass, a new design strategy involving molecular recognition, deep eutectic, and photopolymerization is designed to construct mechanically strong and optically transparent supramolecular materials.








Abstract
The development of transparent materials with mechanical rigidity and hardness via the non&#8208;covalent bonding of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight building blocks is a major challenge. Although various strategies have been developed to improve the mechanical performance of supramolecular materials, they are frequently accompanied by complex designs and tedious syntheses. Therefore, it is urgent to develop perspectives that are fundamentally distinguished from previous strategies. In this study, a new design solution that involves with non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition, deep eutectic solvent formation, and solvent&#8208;free photopolymerization is conceived and validated. Metal coordination and hydrogen bonding between zinc tetrafluoroborate hydrate (ZTH) and acrylamide (AM) facilitated the formation of ZTH&#8208;AM, which can be recognized as the analogue of the glass liquid in the preparation of inorganic glass. ZTH&#8208;AM significantly suppressed the nucleation and crystallization of ZTH and AM. Subsequently, it is used to fabricate transparent poly[ZTH&#8208;AM] glass in bulk using photopolymerization. The obtained supramolecular glass is rigid, exhibiting high tensile strength (93.50 MPa), Young's modulus (1.12 GPa), and hardness (92.1 HD).

         <title>Achieving Mechanical Evolution in Polymer Materials Through Phase Evolution Induced by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy involving in situ polymerization is proposed to achieve &#8220;evolutionary polymer materials&#8221;, whose polymer phases and mechanical properties can both continuously evolve over time. Such a process is controlled by visible light and leads to a significant enhancement of 2400 times in Young's modulus of a hydrogel. A hydrogel metamaterial is constructed based on the spatiotemporal controllability of the above evolution process.








Abstract
Can artificial polymer materials exhibit the characteristic of &#8220;evolution&#8221; over time, similar to biological tissue? The limitations arise from their inherently static nature and the absence of dynamic structures. A strategy is proposed for designing polymer materials whose phases and mechanical properties can be continuously transformed and enhanced temporally. Specifically, the polymer phases experience a sequence of transitions involving generation, separation, and fusion. Each period enhances mechanical properties in distinct and significant ways, demonstrating a mechanical evolution. This evolution is initiated through in situ polymerization within the material and can be precisely controlled using visible light. Applied to a hydrogel system, this approach achieves a record&#8208;breaking increase in Young's modulus by over 2400&#8208;fold, from 18.5&#160;kPa to 44.5&#160;MPa. The findings highlight the potential for tailoring mechanical properties on demand and constructing metamaterials with multilevel moduli and composite architectures.

         <title>Peptide Coacervates with Metal&#8211;Phenolic Membranes Modulate Glucose Metabolism and Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide coacervates encapsulated with interferon&#8208;&#945; and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs) are designed to reprogram glucose competition between tumor and cytotoxic T cells. This metabolic modulation enhances immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis and boosting T cell effector function. The combined use of PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs and surgery prevents tumor recurrence by activating immune memory, offering a promising strategy for cancer therapy.








Abstract
Glucose consumption by tumors induces metabolic restriction of T cells, which results in immune evasion and tumor progression. Regulating cellular metabolism represents a promising strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy; however, redirecting glucose utilization from tumor cells to T cells is challenging. Herein, the activation of cytotoxic T cells using engineered peptide coacervates (PCs) containing interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) (PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs), which promote glucose uptake and glycolysis, is reported. PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs modulate the molecular conformation of the co&#8208;stimulatory lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen 1 on CD8+ T cells, while suppressing tumor cell glycolysis through the sustained release of IFN&#945;, thereby increasing the energy supply for T cells. Furthermore, PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs suppress tumor progression in preclinical orthotopic tumor mouse models by facilitating T cell infiltration and activation. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs further improve therapeutic outcomes (99% inhibition of tumor growth), even in ICB&#8208;insensitive tumor models. Notably, PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs exert a robust immune&#8208;memory effect (a 4.8&#8208;fold increase in memory T cells) and provide long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;tumor activity (over 74 days), thereby preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. The present study offers insights into metabolic intervention mechanisms mediated by glucose modulation and provides a rational design for metal&#8211;organic materials in cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Peptide coacervates encapsulated with interferon-&#945; and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs) are designed to reprogram glucose competition between tumor and cytotoxic T cells. This metabolic modulation enhances immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis and boosting T cell effector function. The combined use of PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs and surgery prevents tumor recurrence by activating immune memory, offering a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucose consumption by tumors induces metabolic restriction of T cells, which results in immune evasion and tumor progression. Regulating cellular metabolism represents a promising strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy; however, redirecting glucose utilization from tumor cells to T cells is challenging. Herein, the activation of cytotoxic T cells using engineered peptide coacervates (PCs) containing interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) (PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs), which promote glucose uptake and glycolysis, is reported. PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs modulate the molecular conformation of the co-stimulatory lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, while suppressing tumor cell glycolysis through the sustained release of IFN&#945;, thereby increasing the energy supply for T cells. Furthermore, PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs suppress tumor progression in preclinical orthotopic tumor mouse models by facilitating T cell infiltration and activation. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs further improve therapeutic outcomes (99% inhibition of tumor growth), even in ICB-insensitive tumor models. Notably, PC-IFN&#945;@MPNs exert a robust immune-memory effect (a 4.8-fold increase in memory T cells) and provide long-lasting anti-tumor activity (over 74 days), thereby preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. The present study offers insights into metabolic intervention mechanisms mediated by glucose modulation and provides a rational design for metal&#8211;organic materials in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Wettability Triboelectric Sensors for Sweat Collection and Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bioinspired triboelectric material with heterogeneous wettability, which is used to construct a lightweight, self&#8208;powered wearable sweat sensor. By integrating an ion&#8208;selective membrane and a wireless transmission module, the device enables selective detection of salt ions and real&#8208;time remote monitoring, offering notable potential for long&#8208;term, continuous health monitoring applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric sweat sensors, endowed with the technical advantages of non&#8208;invasive ex vivo and in situ detection, have catalyzed the rapid advancement of personalized medicine and precision health management systems. However, the inherently low secretion rate and rapid evaporation of sweat pose significant challenges for its efficient collection and rapid analytical screening. This study leverages laser cutting and aqueous interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategies to develop a biomimetic heterogeneous wettability triboelectric material (HWTM). Sweat is rapidly collected from the edge to the center of the material, driven by the combined effect of a wettability gradient and the Laplace pressure difference arising from asymmetric curvature at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. This collection mechanism markedly enriches target analytes, yielding a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 51&#160;dB, which surpasses that of prevailing sweat sensor technologies. A portable wearable patch is engineered by integrating ion&#8208;selective membranes and data processing modules, enabling selective salt ion profiling and real&#8208;time wireless monitoring. This work paves the way for the rational design of sweat sensors grounded in fluidic transport mechanisms.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by an Ultra&#8208;Stable Carbon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional carbon anodes exhibit constrained rate capabilities. This study designed the g&#8208;C3N4@hollow carbon anode that achieves remarkable cycling stability for over 40&#160;000 cycles with enhanced kinetics. The full battery with this anode enables rapid charging in 0.1 h and discharging in 1 h. These findings may pave the way for durable and high&#8208;efficiency Na+ storage.








Abstract
The realization of rapid&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with exceptional power density represents a pivotal challenge for next&#8208;generation electric vehicles. Currently, carbonaceous anodes are considered the most technologically mature yet rate&#8208;limited candidate approaching commercialization. To address the bottlenecks of slow ion transport and interfacial instability in conventional carbon architectures, a hierarchical anode material has been designed by incorporating g&#8208;C3N4 electronic inert layer onto hollow carbon spheres (CN@HCS). This structure not only facilitates Na&#8314; diffusion but also effectively suppresses side reactions, while enabling selective screening of electrons. As a result, the material exhibits outstanding rate capabilities, maintaining high performance even at a current density as high as 40 A g&#8722;1, and demonstrates remarkable cycling stability over 40&#160;000 cycles with negligible capacity decay. Consequently, the full battery enables rapid charging within 0.1&#160;h and delivers a prolonged discharge duration of up to 1&#160;h, accompanied by a high power density of 21&#160;600&#160;W kg&#8722;1(cathode + anode). This work represents a significant advancement in the development of advance anode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Implantable Light&#8208;Powered Human Designer Cells for Electrical Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the eel's electric organ, a miniature implantable biohybrid device is developed to generate electricity under light activation. The device utilizes a light&#8208;dependent ion gradient formation that induced by genetically engineered human designer cells that express light&#8208;sensitive membrane ion channels and proton pumps, working in synergy with the device to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy.








Abstract
Herein, an implantable, miniature biohybrid device has been developed that utilizes light&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;gradient formation by genetically engineered human designer cells, expressing light&#8208;activated ion channels and proton pumps to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy. These designer cells are cultured in custom&#8208;designed polycarbonate chambers, connected by electrodes and separated from an ion reservoir by a proton&#8208;selective Nafion membrane. Upon illumination, the light&#8208;activated channels and pumps on the designer cells establish a sustained proton gradient across the Nafion membrane, which drives an electrical current in the external circuit. When exposed to simulated ambient sunlight of 3&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of intensity, a single solar collection device (SCD), containing these designer cells, appropriately sized for subcutaneous implantation in mice, generates an electrical potential of &#8776;0.4&#160;V. By connecting multiple SCDs in series and increasing the cell suspension volume, the output can be scaled up sufficiently to power a commercial light&#8208;emitting diode. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a photovoltaic system based on optogenetically engineered mammalian cells for powering bioelectronic implants or wearable devices.

         <title>In Situ Soft X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Investigation on Charge Transfer Mechanism in COF/CdS S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work elucidated the electron transfer mechanisms for an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of CdS and covalent organic framework using synchrotron&#8208;based in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Interfacial Cd&#9472;N and Cd&#9472;S bonds act as the charge transfer channels within the heterojunction. This study validates a new approach to characterizing S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and can guide the design of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalysis enabled by step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing the global energy crisis and achieving carbon neutrality. However, mechanisms regulating the interfacial charge transfer dynamics of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions remain elusive. Herein, the electron transfer mechanisms are elucidated for a model S&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of cadmium sulfide and a covalent organic framework material using synchrotron&#8208;based in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, substantiating the well&#8208;established in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that interfacial Cd&#9472;N and Cd&#9472;S bonds act as the charge transfer channels within the heterojunction. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction exhibits high charge separation efficiency, as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, which contributed to enhanced photocatalytic performance in coupled H2O2 generation and organic transformation reactions. This study validates a new approach to characterizing S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and can guide the design of inorganic&#8208;organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for practical photocatalytic applications.

         <title>From Pollution to Value: Electrochemical Systems for Transforming Flue Gas into Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the strategies whereby low&#8208;concentration CO2 in flue gas can be directly valorized to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. It covers recent progress in integrated CO2 capture and conversion, including amine and bi(carbonate) reduction&#8208;based systems. This study also focuses on how the presence of impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides can be overcome.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can enable the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2 emissions. Direct flue gas conversion can address the emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate sectors, including cement, steel, and power generation industries. Such integration with SCO2RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue&#8208;gas&#8208;tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro&#8208;reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO2RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO2RR from amine&#8208;based capture as emerging strategies for high&#8208;rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO2 concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.

         <title>Detecting the Six Polytypes of Five&#8208;Layer Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six possible periodic crystals&#8212;so&#8208;called polytypes of Penta layer graphene are identified using Raman, second harmonic, and electric surface potential measurements. The measurements reveal the polytypes&#8217; abundance, relative stability, and annihilation dynamics, crucial for future multiferroic SlideTronic applications.








Abstract
Graphene layers can assemble in two shifted metastable positions per interface, leading to eight possible structural arrangements in five&#8208;layer graphene, six of which correspond to distinct periodic crystals. These polytypes exhibit diverse symmetries, interlayer electronic hybridization, van der Waals adhesion, and optical responses. Arrangements lacking inversion [I] and mirror [Mz] symmetries host intrinsic polarizations, while those with sufficiently flat electronic bands display orbital magnetization, unconventional superconductivity, and anomalous fractional quantum Hall states. Here, a detailed comparative study of these polytypes is presented, examining their Raman scattering spectra, second&#8208;harmonic optical emission microscopy, and surface electric potential maps. Each configuration is deterministically identified, its natural abundance is quantified, and its relative stability is assessed. Understanding these stacking&#8208;dependent properties is a critical step toward the development of multiferroic devices that leverage sliding transitions between structural configurations.

         <title>Wireless Acousto&#8208;Piezoelectric Conduit with Aligned Nanofibers for Neural Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;driven, highly aligned piezoelectric nanofiber&#8208;based nerve guidance conduit (APNF&#8208;NGC) designed for effective peripheral nerve repair has been demonstrated in this study. Featuring aligned topology, cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces, and an axial electric field, the APNF&#8208;NGC collectively promotes significant nerve regeneration. In vivo experiments validate its effectiveness, revealing nerve repair outcomes comparable to those achieved with autografts.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a significant clinical challenge, leading to severe motor and sensory dysfunction, as well as irreversible tissue atrophy. Autograft has been commonly utilized as the clinical gold standard; however, it is limited by donor availability and secondary surgery requirements. Here, an ultrasound&#8208;responsive, highly aligned piezoelectric nanofiber nerve guidance conduit (APNF&#8208;NGC) is introduced for peripheral nerve regeneration. Fabricated from electrospun poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibers, the APNF&#8208;NGC features an anisotropically oriented architecture with shear piezoelectricity, providing both structural support and wireless electrical stimulation. The incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) tailors mechanical properties, increases piezoelectric&#8208;phase crystallinity, and improves the surface hydrophilicity, thereby enhancing both biocompatibility and acousto&#8208;piezoelectric response. Finite element analysis and electrical assessment confirm that ultrasound activation of the APNF&#8208;NGC generates an axially oriented electric field, facilitating directional axon elongation. In vivo studies using an 8&#8208;mm sciatic nerve defect rat model demonstrated that the APNF&#8208;NGC achieved nerve reinnervation comparable to that of autografts, as comprehensively validated by behavioral, motor function, and histological evaluations. This dual&#8208;function platform, combining physical guidance with electrical stimulation, presents a promising strategy for neural tissue engineering, offers a potential breakthrough in treating long&#8208;gap PNIs.

         <title>Chip&#8208;Scale Graphene/IGZO Cold Source FET Array Enabling Sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is demonstrated in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppressed the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.








Abstract
In this study, the first sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) of graphene/InGaZnO (IGZO) cold&#8208;source field&#8208;effect transistor (CSFET) arrays is demonstrated. The linear density of states of the Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;type graphene suppresses the Boltzmann thermal tail near the graphene/IGZO interface which in turn causes super&#8208;exponentially decaying electron density with increasing energy, leading to an extremely low off current and SS value. In particular, by introducing an HfO2 high&#8208;k dielectric with a low body factor, the surface potential is effectively modulated, further reducing SS by &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, highly uniform sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 SS with a yield of &#8776;89.1% is achieved in the IGZO CSFET 8 &#215; 8 array devices, with a record SS value of 23.66 mV dec&#8722;1 compared to previously reported oxide&#8208;semiconductor transistors. The proposed IGZO CSFET device is expected to drive significant advancements in high&#8208;speed and ultralow&#8208;power electronic circuits.

         <title>Decoding Multi&#8208;Electron Redox Pathways in Carbon&#8208;Free Iron Selenide Cathodes: Enabling Energy&#8208;Dense All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries Across Extreme Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and carbon&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FeSe cathode is first introduced into all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries, which yields a notably high energy density (515.3 Wh kg&#8722;1), high areal loading (&#8776;26 mg cm&#8722;2), wide&#8208;temperature operability (&#8722;20&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (over 6000 cycles), thereby surpassing most of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes currently available.








Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type iron chalcogen cathodes, characterized by the multi&#8208;electron redox reaction and cost&#8208;effectiveness, represent an alternative pathway for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). In this study, &#945;&#8208;FeSe as a cathode is identified that operates stably through a Fe2+/Fe0 redox reaction in a sulfide solid&#8208;state system at 30&#160;&#176;C, without the need for any carbon additives. This carbon&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FeSe cathode exhibits rapid Li+/e&#8722; transfer properties and limited volume change, thus yielding high reversible capacity (564.6 mAh g&#8722;1), long&#8208;term cycling stability (80.3% capacity retention after 800 cycles), high areal loadings (&#8776;26 mg cm&#8722;2), and wide&#8208;temperature operability (&#8722;20&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C). Apart from Fe2+/Fe0 redox reaction, extended cycling or elevated temperature induces partial electrolyte decomposition to generate S&#8208;containing species while triggering a complementary S/S2&#8722; redox process. This dual mechanism enables exceptional cyclability (&gt;6000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C) and a near&#8208;doubled specific capacity of 956 mAh g&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C. Thereby, as&#8208;fabricated ASSLBs deliver the ultrahigh energy densities (515.3 Wh kg&#8722;1/1874.6 Wh L&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, 1568 Wh kg&#8722;1/8310 Wh L&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating the great potential of using iron selenides as the next&#8208;generation cathode for practical applications of ASSLBs.

Apart from Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; redox reaction, extended cycling or elevated temperature induces partial electrolyte decomposition to generate S-containing species while triggering a complementary S/S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox process. This dual mechanism enables exceptional cyclability (&amp;gt;6000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C) and a near-doubled specific capacity of 956 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 120&#160;&lt;sup&gt;&#176;&lt;/sup&gt;C. Thereby, as-fabricated ASSLBs deliver the ultrahigh energy densities (515.3 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/1874.6 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#160;&lt;sup&gt;&#176;&lt;/sup&gt;C, 1568 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/8310 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 120&#160;&lt;sup&gt;&#176;&lt;/sup&gt;C), demonstrating the great potential of using iron selenides as the next-generation cathode for practical applications of ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turbulent Flow&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Graphene&#8208;Skinned Boron Nitride Heterostructures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned h&#8208;BN powdery heterostructure is synthesized through a fluidized bed&#8208;chemical vapor deposition strategy. The potassium metal anodes assembled with the support of such a high&#8208;surface&#8208;energy heterostructure demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (1050 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2).









Abstract
Potassium metal batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their practical development is hindered by the insufficient capacity output and persistent dendritic proliferation at the anode side. Here graphene&#8208;skinned hexagonal boron nitride powder is demonstrated synthesized via fluidized bed&#8208;chemical vapor deposition, realizing conformal growth of layer&#8208;controlled graphene (5&#8211;90 layers) over h&#8208;BN with atomically coupled heterointerfaces. Fluid dynamic simulations of fluidization environments in fluidized&#8208;bed reactors reveal that localized turbulence&#8208;driven precursor transport enables uniform powder fluidization and homogeneous graphene formation. Potassium metal electrodes fabricated with Gr&#8208;skinned h&#8208;BN powder modified Al current collector exhibit favorable cyclic stability (1050 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2) and low nucleation overpotential (&lt;7 mV). The polar hexagonal lattice of h&#8208;BN and high surface energy (43.27 mJ m&#8722;2) of graphene readily promote uniform potassium deposition via Frank&#8208;van der Merwe mode. This dual&#8208;scale approach, which integrates atomic&#8208;scale interface engineering with reactor&#8208;scale manufacture innovation, offers an appealing pathway toward industrial&#8208;level production of high&#8208;performance metal batteries.

By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets. 








Abstract
Fenton&#8208;like systems utilizing micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;engineered catalysts have emerged as a promising technology for water remediation, demonstrating distinctive advantages via their efficient electron transport networks. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces oxidant consumption but also enables thorough mineralization of contaminants. However, current research faces critical challenges in fundamental mechanistic understanding, particularly regarding reactor scale&#8208;up strategies and biological synergy mechanisms, where a cohesive theoretical framework remains to be established. This comprehensive review systematically addresses four pivotal aspects: i) Mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer dynamics and pollutant transformation pathways in micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;enhanced Fenton systems; ii) Development of structure&#8208;activity relationship models for system optimization; iii) Implementation of modular scale&#8208;up methodologies with pilot&#8208;scale validation for engineering feasibility assessment; iv) Quantitative environmental impact evaluation using full lifecycle assessment under carbon neutrality objectives. By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets.

         <title>Charge&#8208;, Size&#8208;, and Symmetry&#8208;Matched Pore Partitioning in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;space&#8208;partition (PSP) strategy is successfully realized on rigid acs&#8208;type frameworks. This breakthrough relies on simultaneous control over symmetry, size, and charge matching between the partitioning agents and the parental frameworks.








Abstract
The pore&#8208;space&#8208;partition (PSP) strategy, which subdivides large pores into smaller segments, has proven highly effective in flexible acs&#8208;type frameworks. However, extending this approach to rigid structures has remained a formidable challenge due to the strict size and symmetry constraints required for partitioning ligands. In this study, it is successfully overcome these limitations and, for the first time, apply the PSP strategy to rigid acs frameworks. This breakthrough relies on the precise geometric and size compatibility between the parent framework and specially designed partitioning ligands. A series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on four ligand pairs and four metal combinations are synthesized. Notably, MOFs incorporating partitioning ligands with a hexaazaphenalene core exhibited exceptional benzene adsorption properties. Among these, the neutral NNM&#8208;750&#8208;Fe, featuring ideal charge balance between the metal trimer (+1) and the partitioning ligand (&#8722;1), demonstrated significantly enhanced benzene uptake at low pressure compared to non&#8208;partitioned and charged&#8208;partitioned analogues. This work not only expands the boundaries of the PSP strategy to rigid frameworks but also opens new avenues for the rational design of high&#8208;performance porous materials for advanced separation and adsorption applications.

         <title>Consecutive Hybrid Bioprinting of Microfiber&#8208;Reinforced Living Muscle Constructs with Highly&#8208;Aligned Cellular Organizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;nozzle consecutive hybrid bioprinting strategy is proposed to fabricate centimeter&#8208;scale living composite constructs that well integrates polymeric microfibers, sacrificial gelatin, and cell&#8208;laden fibrin hydrogels. The microfibrous structure not only provides tunable mechanical properties to the composite constructs, but also enables cell&#8208;induced anisotropic remodeling of fibrin filaments to form highly&#8208;aligned myoblast bundles, closely resembling those of native muscle tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the highly&#8208;organized extracellular matrix microfibrillar networks and directional cellular organization of native skeletal muscles is essential for engineering functional muscle constructs. Here, we propose a consecutive hybrid bioprinting (CHB) strategy to fabricate living composite constructs with polymeric microfibers, sacrificial gelatin and cell&#8208;laden fibrin hydrogels by combining electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing and extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, which enables the engineering of mechanically&#8208;matched and highly&#8208;aligned porous muscle constructs. The bioprinted hydrogel components provide a smooth and dynamically&#8208;rising conductive surface for stable EHD printing of well&#8208;organized microfibers with centimeter height, which conversely provides mechanical support to ensure the structural integrity of the resultant composite constructs. Upon removal of the sacrificial hydrogel, the porous composite constructs maintain their original shape, and native muscle&#8208;like mechanical properties can be achieved by modulating the microfiber configurations. Notably, these microfibrous structures facilitate cell&#8208;induced anisotropic remodeling of fibrin filaments, resulting in cross&#8208;sectional contraction to form highly&#8208;aligned myoblast bundles along the bioprinting trajectory. This enables the CHB of circumferentially or layer&#8208;specifically aligned cellular constructs. The aligned myoblast constructs can be differentiated into multinucleated myotubes with enhanced muscle&#8208;specific protein and gene expression. This CHB strategy provides a promising platform to directly engineer living composite constructs with native anisotropic mechanical properties and cellular organizations.

A non&#8208;contact dipole moment electric modulation strategy is adopted to precisely regulate the magnitude and direction of dipole moments in narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;infrared materials. This strategy enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and promotes J&#8208;aggregation to form a fibrous network, suppresses energetic disorder and electron&#8211;phonon coupling, reduces exciton recombination, and facilitates dissociation, thereby achieving efficient carrier transport.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) detectors, serving as critical technological nodes bridging microscopic molecular recognition and macroscopic intelligent perception, meet the demands of cutting&#8208;edge technologies such as multispectral imaging. Organic semiconductor materials demonstrate unique advantages for NIR organic photodetectors (OPDs) due to their precisely tunable bandgaps, solution processability, flexibility compatibility, and biocompatibility. However, the narrow&#8208;bandgap intrinsic characteristics required for NIR response inevitably lead to carrier concentration surge that exponentially increases dark current, while hot carriers undergo phonon scattering relaxation that suppresses carrier collection. In this work, the inherent limitations of narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer materials are overcome through a contactless direct current external electric field (EEF). The PTB7&#8208;Th:COTIC&#8208;4F device achieves an outstanding detectivity of 2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones at 1100&#160;nm, ranking among the highest values reported in the NIR spectral range. The applied EEF modulates both orientation and magnitude of electric dipole moments in acceptors, inducing ordered face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking, enhancing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and promoting J&#8208;aggregation, thereby facilitating fibrous network formation. Consequently, the optimized film morphology effectively suppresses energetic disorder and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, while simultaneously inhibiting exciton recombination and promoting exciton dissociation to achieve high&#8208;efficiency carrier transport. This non&#8208;contact external field modulation strategy establishes a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;OPDs.

         <title>Programmable and Unidirectional Liquid Self&#8208;Transport on Modular Fluidic Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular fluidic units can achieve versatile on&#8208;surface liquid self&#8208;transport via assembly and integration. Accordingly, the real&#8208;time reconfigurability, unidirectional self&#8208;transport property, and ease of plug&amp;play together confirm opportunities in mass transfer, concentration titration, and future smart liquid manipulation.








Abstract
The precise control of liquids is essential for both organisms in harsh environments and human society. However, current nature&#8208;inspired fluidic systems, especially liquid self&#8208;transport on open&#8208;surfaces, lack programmability due to their inherent fixed structures, and freely integrating such interfaces remains challenging. Here, modular fluidic units (MFUs) enabling real&#8208;time reconfiguration of pathways through the simple assembly and disassembly of joint structures are presented. Continuous self&#8208;transport across discontinuous units is achieved by means of a water bridge induced unidirectional mechanism. Given the promoted transport performance, a series of functional devices are further developed in plane, including switchable flow distributor, stepwise liquid delivery, transport editing, and micro&#8208;reaction platform. These findings provide a facile yet efficient strategy to enable unidirectional self&#8208;transport, simultaneously enhancing the capability of pathway regulating and transport predicting, offering possibilities for future smart liquid manipulation on open&#8208;surfaces.

The emerging galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronics for biomedical applications with passive and active control strategies are summarized. In addition, the challenges and opportunities for galvanic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Bioelectronic devices hold significant promise for advancing biomedical technologies, addressing critical healthcare challenges, and improving the quality of human life. Conventional bioelectronic devices are typically powered by external, bulky batteries connected by extended electrical wires, which limit the compactness and miniaturization of bioelectronics, restrict patient mobility, and increase the risk of complications such as infections and device&#8208;related failures. This perspective discusses the emerging concept of galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, in which galvanic electrodes serve directly as the tissue&#8208;contacting interfaces. We provide an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of biocompatible galvanic cells in galvanic devices for diverse biomedical applications, including electrical modulation, chemical and biochemical modulation, and hybrid electrical/(bio)chemical modulation, along with their control strategies: passive control and active control. Furthermore, we envision that the advancement of galvanic devices will represent a promising direction for biomedical applications, despite the presence of inherent challenges.

         <title>Artificial Transmembrane Oligopeptide&#8208;Integrated Interferon mRNA with Monoclonal Antibody to Improve Specificity and Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the specificity and efficacy of combination immunotherapy while minimizing its adverse toxic effects, this study proposes a novel, simple, and versatile platform by an artificial transmembrane oligopeptide to integrate mRNA with monoclonal antibody into one nanoparticle (aCmRi). aCmRi possesses distinctive capabilities for targeting tumor cells, facilitating transmembrane transport of mRNA, and realizing in situ expression of IFN&#946; and PD&#8208;L1 blocking.








Abstract
Combination therapy to improve the immunotherapy response rate without causing treatment toxicity remains a significant challenge. Here, an artificial transmembrane oligopeptide, cholesterol&#8208;grafted polylysine (CPL), is synthesized to integrate mRNA with a monoclonal antibody into a single system. CPL with a 6% substitution degree is optimized and complexed with IFN&#946; mRNA to form CmRi nanoparticles. Subsequently, anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (aPD&#8208;L1) is modified on the surface of CmRi to produce aCmRi nanoparticles. Notably, CPL facilitates cytosolic delivery via a membrane&#8208;interacting mechanism, thereby bypassing lysosomal degradation of mRNA. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CPL promoted tumor cell apoptosis and upregulated MHC I expression by disrupting lysosomes in tumor cells. Additionally, CPL combined tumor cell&#8208;targeting and PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory functions of aPD&#8208;L1 with the multidimensional immunoadjuvant properties of in situ&#8208;expressed IFN&#946;. This approach overcame the side effects of IFN&#946; while fully leveraging its therapeutic potential.&#160;In a B16&#8208;F10 melanoma mouse model, aCmRi demonstrated a superior mRNA transfection rate (26.1%) and achieved the highest tumor suppression rate (89.9%) among all test formulations, without causing significant toxicity. This study presents a simple and versatile strategy to enhance the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of tumor immunotherapy in vivo.

         <title>A Synergistic 3D&#8208;Printed Collar Transforms Radiofrequency Ablation Into Potent Thermal Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;functional 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar (3D&#8208;LC12) is designed for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined therapy against lung cancer. The temperature&#8208;sensitive 3D&#8208;LC12 can respond to the radiofrequency electrical field during treatment, enhancing heating temperature, ablation area, and nano&#8208;adjuvant's diffusion. Then, the released nano&#8208;adjuvant could form an in situ therapeutic cancer vaccine, activate APCs, and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), triggering a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Interventional thermal therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is a preferred therapy for non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, part of some patients will still suffer from tumor recurrence due to incomplete ablation (e.g., restricted thermal conductivity, etc.). Notably, RFA can evoke anti&#8208;tumor immunity by releasing tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs), but this effect is weak. Herein, to boost thermal and immune therapeutic efficiency for complete tumor eradication, an effective nano&#8208;adjuvant (CpG&#8208;pIL12&#8208;LDHs, LC12), layered double hydroxides (LDHs) carrying immune stimulators, CpG ODN (CpG) and IL&#8208;12 plasmid (pIL&#8208;12), is developed, which is further integrated into a 3D&#8208;printed collar for eliciting potent thermotherapy and therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer. The as&#8208;prepared 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar (3D&#8208;LC12) can be attached to the RFA electronic needle and respond to the radiofrequency electrical field during treatment, enhancing ablation temperature, area, and nano&#8208;adjuvant's diffusion. After release from the temperature&#8208;sensitive collar, LC12 can form an in situ therapeutic cancer vaccine, activate APCs, and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), triggering a robust antitumor immune response. Therefore, the current study demonstrates a multi&#8208;functional 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar for efficient eradication of lung cancer via one&#8208;time RFA&#8208;integrated therapy, providing a novel combined strategy for interventional thermal therapy against tumors.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Recovery Polycationic Fibroin for Hemostasis&#8208;Regeneration Transition by Recapitulating Natural Coagulation Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by fibrin's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) recapitulates natural coagulation networks by replicating the aggregation state and maturation process of fibrin through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet, which achieves hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition.









Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and deep trauma restricts the effective hemostasis and tissue regeneration management, even causing death. The formation of the fibrin network is the initial stage of wound control. Inspired by Fn's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) is designed to achieve hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition. pCSF/&#946; replicates the aggregation state and maturation process of Fn through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet to recapitulate natural coagulation networks, achieving mechanical reinforcement and shape recovery. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses reveal that pCSF/&#946; connects hemostasis and regeneration through platelet contents&#8217; release and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The results of incompressible hemostasis, large&#8208;area skin repair, and penetrating liver regeneration in animal models such as minipigs confirm pCSF/&#946; is superior to clinical products in rapid hemostasis and synchronous tissue regeneration. The molecular design of pCSF/&#946; provides new insights for developing biomaterials in rapid hemostasis and simultaneous regeneration.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Perovskite Planar Detectors Surpass CdZnTe in High&#8208;Energy Gamma&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CZT and CsPbBr3 differ primarily in charge transport. CZT's much lower hole &#181;&#964; leads to charge trapping and broader high&#8208;energy peaks. In contrast, CsPbBr3 has balanced electron and hole &#181;&#964; products, reducing trapping and producing sharper photopeaks. As a result, planar detectors of CsPbBr3 deliver superior spectral resolution above 500&#160;keV.








Abstract
The detection of high&#8208;energy gamma radiation (&gt;1 MeV) at room temperature requires large&#8208;volume semiconductor crystals with high absorption efficiency, charge transport properties, and stability. The CsPbBr3 perovskite is a promising candidate due to its congruent melting growth, high defect tolerance, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. In this study, the performance of CsPbBr3 is evaluated as a gamma&#8208;ray detector across a wide energy range and up to 1332 keV and compare its efficacy to commercial CdZnTe (CZT) detectors of similar crystal thickness. The CsPbBr3 detectors demonstrate high energy resolution, superior spectral fidelity for high&#8208;energy gamma peaks (&gt;1 MeV), and long&#8208;term operational stability over 225 days without performance loss. Notably, CsPbBr3 resolves closely spaced gamma lines with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, including weak emissions from depleted uranium sources. Its more balanced charge transport compared to CZT minimizes signal distortion, even in thick detectors, and enables precise spectral peak definition without complex correction algorithms. Comparative measurements on planar detectors demonstrate that CsPbBr3 achieves comparable energy resolution to CZT at energies &lt;0.5 MeV and outperforms at high energies, making it a strong alternative for next&#8208;generation radiation detection applications.

         <title>Robust Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network on Positively Charged Ru&#8208;N&#8208;Ni Dual Sites Boosts Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a nitrogen&#8208;bridged Ru&#8208;Ni3N dual&#8208;site catalyst with positive charges for alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The nitrogen&#8208;bridged Ru and Ni dual sites enhance mass transport by constructing an ordered water&#8208;directed interfacial hydrogen bond network, achieving record&#8208;breaking mass activity and stability. This provides new insights into the mechanism of interfacial water structure regulation and promotes the application of high&#8208;performance hydrogen electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based dual&#8208;site catalysts can efficiently accelerate alkaline hydrogen electrocatalytic kinetics by virtue of the well&#8208;balanced competitive adsorptions of multiple reaction intermediates. However, their insufficient mass transfer makes them far away from the applications, largely lying to the challenge of precisely manipulating the interface water structure. Herein, a concept of nitrogen&#8208;bridged positively charged dual sites with a robust interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network is presented for enhancing alkaline hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR and HER). The positively charged Ru and Ni sites are demonstrated to trigger the ordered water orientation with the favorable &#8220;O&#8208;down&#8221; configuration, strengthening the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network and promoting the mass transfer. In particular, the efficient charge&#8208;transfer channels of asymmetric Ru&#8208;N&#8208;Ni bridges can maintain the high&#8208;valence of Ru sites and high electron density of Ni sites, thus stabilizing *OH adsorption on Ru sites and weakening *H adsorption on Ni sites, as well as enhancing anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. As a result, the elaborated Ru&#8208;Ni3N catalysts achieve a mass activity of 60.6 A g&#8722;1 for HOR, representing one of the most active one among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts yet reported. This interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network modulation strategy can also be extended to HER electrocatalysis, driving the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer to achieve a low cell voltage of 1.79&#160;V at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability at an industrial current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for more than 550 h.

         <title>Soft Robotic Engines with Non&#8208;Reciprocal Motion by Physical Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Movement is vital, and it requires breaking symmetry. This study introduces a hydrogel engine that achieves non&#8208;reciprocal motion through kinetic asymmetry in repeated actuation cycles. This approach for breaststroke&#8208;swimming&#8208;like motion is embedded inside the material and establishes a new paradigm of physical intelligence for soft robotics.








Abstract
Movement is essential for living systems, enabling access to food, habitats, or escape from threats. Across scales, a key unifying principle is symmetry breaking to achieve non&#8208;reciprocal motion and accumulate work. In soft robotics, many actuators mimic biological responsiveness, but they typically exhibit reciprocal motion, where forward work is canceled in the return stroke &#8211; preventing work accumulation in cyclic operation. Here, a simple and broadly applicable hydrogel engine concept is presented that overcomes this limitation by encoding kinetic asymmetry into swelling and deswelling transitions. This hard&#8208;coded asymmetry yields non&#8208;reciprocal motion trajectories, enabling continuous mechanical work extraction under a single, uniform stimulus &#8211; without complex external control. The strategy embodies a material&#8208;based ratchet mechanism rooted in physical intelligence, independent of geometry or scale, and generalizable across stimuli. This hydrogel engine is implemented in soft robotic systems, including artificial cilia for fluid pumping and conveyor belts for object transport. Starting from macroscopic thermoresponsive systems, the design is extended to microscale formats via 3D printing and to other stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This approach shifts the paradigm in soft robotics &#8211; from increasing chemical complexity to leveraging intrinsic material properties for emergent function &#8211; paving the way for scalable, autonomous systems driven by physical intelligence.

         <title>A Ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Bottle Strategy: Crosslinking Amines and Epoxides inside MOF Pores for Enhanced CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr&#8208;BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO2 adsorption capacity, exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non&#8208;crosslinked alkylamines amines.








Abstract
This study introduces a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr&#8208;BDC (also MIL&#8208;101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF&#8208;polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO2 capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr&#8208;BDC&#8208;TAEA&#8208;BDE (branched&#8208;linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO2 capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO2/N2 selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N2/CO2 separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the four MOF&#8208;polymer composites are subjected to up to 100 temperature swing adsorption/desorption&#160;cycles (at 313 and 393 K, respectively), revealing minimal amine leaching or degradation over time. Notably, the composites also show significantly enhanced cyclability compared to Cr&#8208;BDC impregnated with amines without epoxide crosslinking agents; this indicates that crosslinking inhibits amine leaching.

     alt="A Ship-in-a-Bottle Strategy: Crosslinking Amines and Epoxides inside MOF Pores for Enhanced CO2 Capture Performance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;ship-in-a-bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr-BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity, exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non-crosslinked alkylamines amines.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a &#8220;ship-in-a-bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3-butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr-BDC (also MIL-101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF-polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, isosteric heat of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr-BDC-TAEA-BDE (branched-linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively.

         <title>Linear and Symmetric Artificial Synapses Driven by Hydrogen Bonding for Accurate and Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven interface engineering enables highly linear and symmetric artificial synapses based on CsPbI3&#8211;PVA hybrids. This strategy suppresses trap states and guides directional ion migration, yielding stable optoelectronic plasticity. The devices achieve ultralow power operation and human&#8208;like learning in neuromorphic networks, offering a scalable route for edge AI and cognitive computing systems.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by integrating memory and processing to emulate synaptic behavior. Artificial synapses enable this functionality through analog conductance modulation, low&#8208;power operation, and nanoscale integration. Halide perovskites with high ionic mobilities and solution processabilities have emerged as promising materials for such devices; however, inherent stochastic ion migration and thermal instability lead to asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics, ultimately impairing their learning and inference capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface engineering strategy to stabilize CsPbI3 artificial synapses. Density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses indicate that the hydroxyl groups in PVA form robust O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; bonds with surface iodides, promoting vertical lattice ordering. This suppresses grain boundary defects and enables directional ion migration, resulting in extremely linear and symmetric optoelectronic conductance modulation (&#945;p = 0.004, &#945;d = 0.020), over eight fold reduction in interfacial trap density, and high&#8208;temperature retention (&gt;104 s). When integrated into a neural network, artificial synapses show large&#8208;scale image classification accuracy within 1.62% of the theoretical limit. The proposed strategy provides a scalable pathway toward overcoming the existing limitations of artificial synapses, exhibiting high potential for application in edge AI, autonomous systems, and material&#8208;based cognitive modeling.

         <title>High Robustness and Multistability of Small Mesoscale Continuous GFRP Metamaterials: Novel M&#246;bius Strip Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel M&#246;bius metamaterial is proposed. By integrating advanced 3D printing technology with traditional composite manufacturing processes, the researchers have successfully fabricated small&#8208;mesoscale, complex FRP composite structures. The remarkable achievement of this material&#8208;process&#8208;structure integration lies in the unprecedented balance it achieves among lightweight, high&#8208;strength, high&#8208;resilience, reconfigurable, multi&#8208;stable, and excellent acoustic performance characteristics of the resulting structures.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composite mechanical metamaterials have emerged as promising candidates for multifunctional structural applications owing to their exceptional strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios. However, achieving concurrent high stiffness, high strength, and large recoverable strain in such structures remains challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs between these properties. To address this limitation, a novel M&#246;bius&#8208;inspired metamaterial through optimized fiber orientation design is developed. Notably, compared to conventional fully composite metastructures, the design achieves a 67% reduction in unit cell size while maintaining comparable stiffness and enhanced recoverable strain capacity. The proposed structure exhibits three distinctive characteristics: effective low&#8208;frequency sound insulation, reconfigurable adaptability, and secondary deformability after the hot molding process. These synergistic effects enable enhanced collaboration, enable multifunctional capabilities, including noise reduction, programmable Poisson's ratio (&#8722;0.4 to +0.6), and mechanical switching behavior. These performance improvements originate from synergistic fiber&#8208;matrix interactions and unique bending&#8208;twisting deformations inherent to the M&#246;bius geometry, which are previously undocumented in fully composite metamaterials. This deformation mode facilitates significant elastic energy storage while minimally influencing peak stress levels associated with material failure. These findings elucidate a fundamental mechanism for developing high&#8208;performance composite metamaterials with tailorable energy storage capacity, addressing critical challenges in adaptive structural engineering.

         <title>Worse Interference of Fe3+ than Fe2+ on Degrading the Interphase and Performance of LiFePO4||Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interference of Fe3+ and Fe2+ cross&#8208;talk on degrading the interphase and performance of LiFePO4||Graphite batteries is compared and proved that Fe2+ mainly exacerbates existing electrolyte decomposition pathway while Fe3+ further facilitates radical recombination and catalyzes two&#8208;electron electrolyte decomposition; the latter is validated to be present in the practical LiFePO4||Graphite batteries, resulting in severe side reaction and capacity decline.








Abstract
The detrimental effects of Fe&#8208;ion crosstalk on LiFePO4||Graphite battery performance, coupled with limited mechanistic insights into solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) evolution under such interference, warrant systematic investigation. Herein, advanced characterization techniques&#8212;including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy&#8212;are employed to reveal SEI evolution on graphite anodes under Fe2+/Fe3+ influence. Results demonstrate that Fe3+ exerts more severe adverse effects than Fe2+. Specifically, Fe2+ primarily promotes conventional electrolyte reduction reactions, increasing H2, CH4, and CO2 generation. In contrast, Fe3+ facilitates radical combinations and catalyzes two&#8208;electron reductions, triggering side reactions releasing CO, C2H4, and C2H6. The SEI thickness under Fe&#8208;ion interference (Fe2+: 7.20&#8211;13.76&#160;nm, Fe3+: 9.12&#8211;17.55&#160;nm) significantly exceeds that of the base electrolyte (3.15&#8211;7.64&#160;nm), with Fe deposits accumulating in organometallic forms. Critically, the presence of Fe3+ and its adverse impacts on battery safety and cycling stability are validated in practical pouch cells. This study uncovers the chemical nature of the dissolved Fe ion and its deposits, provides mechanistic insights into its interference with SEI properties and Li&#8208;ion battery performances, which in turn helps to mitigate such detrimental effects.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Abundant Molybdenum Dioxide Electrodes with Minimal Interfacial Charge&#8208;Transfer Resistance for Ultrafast Filter Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous MoO2&#8722;x electrode featuring oxygen vacancy&#8208;abundant characteristics is engineered via laser&#8208;induced in situ synthesis, which exhibits significantly reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, showcasing superior high&#8208;frequency capacitive performance of metal oxide&#8208;based electrochemical capacitors.








Abstract
Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) are considered capable of replacing bulky and low&#8208;capacitance aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) in alternative&#8208;current filtering, yet regrettably, they have been plagued by slow ion migration and sluggish electrical response. Non&#8208;carbon&#8208;based electrode materials, while exhibiting significantly higher electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) compared to carbon&#8208;based electrodes, still face the challenge of relatively high interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) that needs to be overcome. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer kinetics enhancement strategy is demonstrated by utilizing the lattice oxygen deficiency in molybdenum dioxide (MoO2&#8722;x) to increase metallic electrical conductivity and the number of active sites. This strategy substantially reduces the Rct, thereby upgrading the high&#8208;frequency performance of ECs, featuring the first high&#8208;performance and scalable metal oxide&#8208;based ultrafast ECs. The ECs with aqueous electrolyte achieve a phase angle (&#966;) of &#8722;80&#176; and a specific capacitance of 966.8 &#181;F cm&#8722;2 (3.9 F cm&#8722;3) at 120 Hz, while the surface&#8208;mountable capacitors incorporating NC@MoO2&#8722;x and EMImBF4 demonstrate a &#966; of &#8722;80.3&#176; and super&#8208;long cycle stability (1&#160;400&#160;000 cycles), surpassing commercial AECs in many key performance indexes. This approach aligns with modern embedded electronic component manufacturing processes, which is about to provide profound impact to the advancement of high&#8208;performance miniaturized components and emerging electronic technologies.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrode featuring oxygen vacancy-abundant characteristics is engineered via laser-induced in situ synthesis, which exhibits significantly reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface, showcasing superior high-frequency capacitive performance of metal oxide-based electrochemical capacitors.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) are considered capable of replacing bulky and low-capacitance aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) in alternative-current filtering, yet regrettably, they have been plagued by slow ion migration and sluggish electrical response. Non-carbon-based electrode materials, while exhibiting significantly higher electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) compared to carbon-based electrodes, still face the challenge of relatively high interfacial charge transfer resistance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ct&lt;/sub&gt;) that needs to be overcome. Here, a charge-transfer kinetics enhancement strategy is demonstrated by utilizing the lattice oxygen deficiency in molybdenum dioxide (MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) to increase metallic electrical conductivity and the number of active sites. This strategy substantially reduces the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ct&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby upgrading the high-frequency performance of ECs, featuring the first high-performance and scalable metal oxide-based ultrafast ECs. The ECs with aqueous electrolyte achieve a phase angle (&lt;i&gt;&#966;&lt;/i&gt;) of &#8722;80&#176; and a specific capacitance of 966.8 &#181;F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3.9 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at 120 Hz, while the surface-mountable capacitors incorporating NC@MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Generalizable Porous Aromatic Framework&#8208;Included Polymer Membranes for Diffusion&#8208;Enhanced Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work contains a generalizable procedure for enhancing the gas permeability and aging resistance of polymer membranes without compromising selectivity by incorporating robust porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). The PAF fillers are highly dispersible in a wide range of solvents, and amine&#8208;functionalization of the PAF enhances the plasticization resistance of the mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.








Abstract
Industrial separation processes account for 10&#8211;15% of global energy consumption. Membrane&#8208;based processes are less energy&#8208;intensive than traditional gas separation technologies; however, enhanced material separation performance and stability for numerous gas mixtures are needed for widespread industrial adoption. This work presents a generalizable strategy for preparing mixed&#8208;matrix gas separation membranes exceeding the performance upper bounds of existing polymer membranes for a wide variety of industrial gases. By incorporating robust porous aromatic framework (PAF) particles into various dense commercial polymer matrices, gas diffusivity and solubility can be enhanced. For diverse gas mixtures (e.g., CO2/N2, O2/N2, He/CH4, H2/N2, and C2H4/C2H6), the resulting composite membranes exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities&#8212;by as much as 520%&#8212;and largely unchanged selectivities even after 6 years of aging under simulated flue gas conditions. These improvements arise from the ultrahigh porosity, excellent chemical compatibility, and unique physicochemical properties of the embedded PAF particles. Functionalizing the PAFs with polyamines also enables composite membranes that achieve among the highest reported performances against plasticization, a common obstacle in commercializing gas separation membranes. Significantly, the PAF&#8208;1 particles are readily dispersible in various common membrane casting solvents, suggesting their broader utility as a filler for designing high&#8208;performance membranes for many industrial gas separations.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Powered Terahertz Metamaterials as a Real&#8208;Time Biosensing Platform for In Vivo Thrombus Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MXene&#8208;powered terahertz (THz) metamaterial platform significantly enhanced early, real&#8208;time in vivo thrombus detection sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) for cardiovascular disease patients, surpassing current methods like thromboelastogram and activated clotting time (ACT) method. This system detects thrombus 6 min faster and provided anticoagulant feedback 2 min earlier than ACT, enabling personalized clinical anticoagulation strategies to reduce thrombotic risk.








Abstract
Precise, timely, and personalized in vivo thrombus monitoring is critical for improving the treatment effectiveness and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has become increasingly important as a novel tool in biomedical engineering due to its rapid analysis ability, high temporal resolution, and label&#8208;free measurement modality. However, achieving high thrombus sensing performance in real blood environments remains a significant challenge. In this work, a thrombus sensing platform is developed using an MXene&#8208;powered THz hybrid metamaterial, which substantially increases early thrombus detection sensitivity and real&#8208;time sensing ability by utilizing the highly sensitive THz response from the interfacial charge transfer between MXene and the thrombus. When applied to patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, the sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) of diagnosing a thrombus using this platform surpassed the capabilities of current clinical methods, including the thromboelastogram and the activated clotting time (ACT) method. Furthermore, the platform provides faster assay performances for in vivo thrombus detection (6&#160;min in advance) and anticoagulant effectiveness feedback (2&#160;min in advance) than the ACT method. The proposed platform demonstrates the potential for tailoring clinical anticoagulation strategies for individual patients to substantially reduce the current high risk of thrombus complications among those with CVDs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Blade&#8208;Coating Process Assisted by a Direct Nonuniform Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of fabricating efficient thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer solar cells for industrial production by introducing a non&#8208;contact DC field method during blade coating. The technique optimizes bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology with enhanced vertical phase separation, eventually achieving a record efficiency of 17.59%.








Abstract
The incorporation of thick active layers (&gt;300&#160;nm) is an essential requirement for wide&#8208;scale industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve efficient thick film devices, in particular for all&#8208;polymer OSCs, which are generally considered the most stable type of OSCs. In this study, a simple yet effective method is introduced by using a direct current (DC) field to manipulate the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films within all&#8208;polymer OSCs during a blade coating process. By utilizing this method, a favorable vertical phase distribution is achieved, thereby effectively reducing the electron percolation threshold and enhancing the overall device performance. With this, an outstanding efficiency of 17.59% is achieved for thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer devices by blade&#8208;coating, which is the best performance in this category. This study introduces a non&#8208;contact DC field method aimed at mitigating the fabrication challenges encountered when transitioning thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer systems from laboratory to manufacturing settings, and will potentially contributing to the advancement of the OSC industrialization.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Resorbable Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is presented that combine on&#8208;demand data erasure, transient functionality, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for secure, short&#8208;lived electronics. Through dissolution studies under physiological conditions, this is demonstrated that MTJ functionality can be removed within 10 h. Moreover, the bio&#8208;resorbable lifetime can be tuned by selecting appropriate materials and adjusting the layer thickness of individual layers.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non&#8208;volatile memory, MTJs has received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio&#8208;resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, the bio&#8208;resorbability of MTJ is investigated by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer&#8208;thick constituent layers in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio&#8208;resorbable materials, exhibit well&#8208;controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 h of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high&#8208;performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short&#8208;lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next&#8208;generation bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Monolayer MnPS3 Nanosheet Integration for Extended Exciton Diffusion and Charge Transport in High&#8208;Performance Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D atomic crystal, MnPS3, is integrated into active layer to extend exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the resulting OPVs achieves a highly thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristic with a PCE of 19.70% at an active&#8208;layer thickness of 300 nm.








Abstract
Industrial&#8208;scale roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) requires photoactive layers &#8805;300 nm for manufacturability and mechanical robustness, yet state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;efficiency systems remain confined to 80&#8211;120 nm due to intrinsic exciton diffusion and charge transport limitations. To resolve this fundamental thickness&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off, monolayer MnPS3 nanosheet (1&#8211;2 nm) via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are engineered to extend exciton diffusion lengths and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge mobility, as validated through multimodal characterization. The optimized PM6:Y6:MnPS3&#160;system achieves record efficiencies of 19.53% (100 nm) and 18.41% (300 nm), demonstrating unprecedented 94.3% thickness tolerance and setting the highest reported retention for thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) OPVs. Universal applicability is evidenced through 20.45%/19.70% (D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO system) and 20.41%/19.62% (D18:L8&#8208;BO system) efficiencies at 100/300 nm, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thick&#8208;film devices. This monolayer MnPS3 nanosheet integration paradigm establishes a general design rule for thickness&#8208;insensitive organic semiconductors, overcoming the critical photon harvesting&#8208;charge extraction dichotomy in industrial&#8208;scale OPV manufacturing.

         <title>Breaking the Conversion Limit in an Intercalation&#8208;Type Cathode by Loosening Aqueous Cation Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A loose cation coordination environment in dilute aqueous perchlorate electrolyte drives Bi2Se3 from typical intercalation to reversible dual intercalation&#8208;conversion, achieving high capacity, elevated discharge potential, rapid kinetics, and exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability over 20&#8201;000 cycles, offering a new pathway to boost aqueous multivalent battery performance.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type cathodes continue to dominate aqueous multivalent ion storage, despite higher theoretical capacities being available from conversion reactions involving multiple electron transfer. Pushing intercalation&#8208;type cathodes into conversion is certainly desirable, conventionally with great sacrificing cycling&#8208;stability, kinetics, and discharge potential. To date, limited progress has been achieved in overcoming this longstanding and formidable performance trade&#8208;off. Herein, it is demonstrated that by loosening cation coordination in dilute aqueous systems, typical intercalation&#8208;type electrodes (Bi2Se3) can be unexpectedly extended into the conversion regime, yielding a twofold capacity increase of 417.6 mAh g&#8722;1 with an excellent combination of reversible lifespan (20&#8201;000 cycles with a decay rate of 0.013&#8240;), rate capability (314.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and enhanced operating potential. Composited operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction technology, first&#8208;principal calculations, and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with electron microscopy analyses indicated that hydrophobic perchlorate optimizes the solvation coordination and charge transfer of cations, which overall decreases the interfacial reaction barrier and enhances the reaction potential, hence initiating unique reversible and depth intercalation&#8210;conversion mechanisms. Well&#8208;characterized loosening cation coordination further ensures high ion mobility, extraordinary low&#8208;temperature performance, and robust operation in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, offering key insights for improving the energy density of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Organic Afterglow Emitters for Visual Observation of Hydrogel Formation in Biomedical Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomedical hydrogels play vital roles in various applications but lack visual confirmation of gelation and localization. This study introduces organic afterglow emitters exhibiting bright and persistent afterglow upon hydrogel formation. This gelation&#8208;induced afterglow, driven by reduced oxygen diffusion and concentration within hydrogels, enables precise visualization of gelation, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance organic afterglow in soft matter systems.








Abstract
Biomedical hydrogels are integral to a wide range of applications, with their efficacy critically hinging on precise delivery and successful gelation at targeted sites. Nevertheless, existing technologies that provide reliable, visual confirmation of gelation and accurate localization remain very limited. Here organic afterglow emitters are reported that are designed with small phosphorescence rate (kP &#8776; 0.04 s&#8722;1), small nonradiative decay rate (knr &#8776; 0.01 s&#8722;1), and controllable oxygen quenching rate (kq). The organic emitters exhibit no afterglow in liquid state under ambient conditions. Upon hydrogel formation, the organic emitters, embedded within the as&#8208;formed biomedical hydrogel, demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow with phosphorescence lifetimes extending up to 15.82 s. This gelation&#8208;induced afterglow, characterized by a high on/off contrast, facilitates a visual observation of successful hydrogel formation and precise localization of biomedical hydrogels. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that, within the biomedical hydrogel, the diffusion of oxygen is significantly impeded and oxygen concentration is also reduced, leading to a substantially small kq of the organic emitter (&#8776;0.02 s&#8722;1) and subsequent emergence of the afterglow. This study presents a novel afterglow&#8208;based approach for visualizing hydrogel formation and localization, and meanwhile offering an innovative strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance organic afterglow in soft matter systems.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvent Aggregation Chemistry to Enable Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by solvent aggregation in the inner Helmholtz plane, leading to sluggish Na+ diffusion. This study reveals that a free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, in which polarization interactions induced by orbital overlap between solvent molecules and free radicals, disrupts solvent alignment. This strategy enhances cycling stability, maintaining performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C for 2400 cycles.








Abstract
The capability of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) to operate under extreme temperatures is highly desirable; however, achieving stable performance remains challenging due to limitations in interfacial dynamics. Here, it is revealed that at low temperatures, linear solvents tend to aggregate within the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), leading to the formation of a solvent&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To address this issue, it is proposed to leverage the polarization interaction induced by the orbital overlap between the solvent molecules and free radicals as an effective approach to breaking solvent aggregation. This interaction leads to a redistribution of electron density, reducing the electron cloud density and lowering molecular polarity. Significantly, the reduced polarity weakens intermolecular ordering, promoting interfacial restructuring that enhances mass transfer and facilitates the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double&#8208;layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low&#8208;temperature battery technologies.

         <dc:description>
Unresolved thermodynamic mechanisms in active&#8208;layer optimization limit efficiency enhancement in organic solar cells. Here, real&#8208;time thermal imaging coupled with in situ absorption spectroscopy is utilized to elucidate the temperature&#8208;dependent assembly dynamics during sequential deposition of active&#8208;layer films on hot&#8208;substrate. Finally, over 20% efficiency is demonstrated in three different systems: 20.02% (D18/eC9&#8208;4F), 20.25 (D18/eC9), and 20.64% (D18/L8&#8208;BO, certified 20.10%).








Abstract
Despite thermodynamics playing a central role in active&#8208;layer optimization, unresolved temperature&#8208;dependent mechanisms hinder further efficiency improvements in organic solar cell. Herein, real&#8208;time thermal imaging is employed to unravel the temperature&#8208;controlled assembly dynamics during sequential processing (SqP) of active&#8208;layer films on a hot&#8208;substrate (HS). The HS process provides higher temperature and prolonged heating time for the active layer during SqP compared to the widely adopted hot&#8208;solution technique, enabling accelerated liquid&#8208;phase reorganization and nucleation in the bottom layer. The HS&#8208;induced interfacial energy difference promotes layer interpenetration and achieves suitable donor content in the bottom region of the active layer while boosting exciton generation. The highly crystalline fibrous structure improves hole mobility and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination (0.214&#160;eV), yielding a high fill factor (81.00%) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (0.868&#160;V). The 100&#160;nm&#8208;thick D18 HS/eC9 device achieves an efficiency of 19.75% (vs 18.89% for the control) and retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h under &#8776;1 sun illumination (vs 84% for the control). With 2PACZ as the hole transport layer, over 20% efficiency is demonstrated in three systems: 20.02% (D18/eC9&#8208;4F), 20.25 (D18/eC9), and 20.64% (D18/L8&#8208;BO, certified 20.10%). Notably, HS&#8208;processed 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick binary devices achieve over 18.12% efficiency&#8212;among the highest reported.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) ferroelectric polymer with Au electrode becomes an effective photo&#8208;pyroelectric harvester, achieving a record energy density of 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 that is discharged in several milliseconds. Simultaneously, the material exhibits a large light induced capacitance change of 281%, realizing light&#8208;tunable energy storage. The discoveries enable the combination of pyroelectric harvesting and energy storage in one material.








Abstract
The rapid growth of micro&#8208;devices demands power supplies with remote self&#8208;powering, high energy density, and high power capability, thereby driving continuous advancements in energy harvesting technology. Here, a novel photo&#8208;pyroelectric energy harvester based on poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) ferroelectric polymer is presented, addressing the limitations of conventional pyroelectric energy harvesting technologies, particularly their low energy and power densities. The unique photothermal effect of nanostructured Au electrode on the polymer generates rapid temperature oscillations of the polymer under visible light, enabling efficient pyroelectric energy harvesting. The harvester achieves a highest energy density of 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 and a highest power density of 1711.9&#160;W cm&#8722;3, surpassing existing pyroelectric energy harvesters. Furthermore, functioning as dielectric capacitors, the Au metallized polymer films exhibit a photo&#8208;capacitance effect as high as 281%, allowing for greatly enhanced energy storage and power conditioning capabilities via light irradiation. In addition, the successful combination of pyroelectric energy harvesting and electrostatic energy storage, which are often considered to be incompatible in term of energy generating mechanism and energy release speed, in one material offers a promising strategy for developing compact energy supply and power conditioning devices for various applications.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Mechano Symbiosis Dual&#8208;Mode Janus Bioaerogel for Context&#8208;Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting Beyond Solar Reliance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA), capable of efficient atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar dependency, is created. The inherent hygroscopicity from the bio&#8208;based matrix and strongly anchored LiCl endow DBJA with excellent moisture harvesting capacity. The DBJA demonstrates outstanding advantages in solar&#8208;independent operation, adsorption, desorption, sustainability, and scalability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SS&#8208;AWH) offers promise for addressing global freshwater scarcity. However, the SS&#8208;AWH heavily relies on favorable and sustained solar irradiation; yet real&#8208;world solar irradiation exhibits significant spatiotemporal fluctuations, limiting its sustainable application, as non/low&#8208;light conditions sharply reduce water productivity. This constraint is fundamentally due to the singleness of the water release pathway via photothermal desorption. Here, a novel dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA) is presented, enabling efficient, all&#8208;weather, multi&#8208;scenario atmospheric water harvesting via selectively solar&#8208;driven and compression&#8208;activated water release. The Janus structure optimizes mass/heat transfer between hygroscopic and photothermal domains, achieving the most balanced adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics and compression&#8208;recovery strength for solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis. Under favorable sunlight, DBJA demonstrates a competitive water release efficiency of 1.32 g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 outdoors. Crucially, without solar irradiation, DBJA achieves a total water productivity of 12.80 g g&#8722;1 over 5&#8208;cycle adsorption&#8208;compression with 98% volume recovery and is stable within 50 cycles. Enhanced physical inlay and multiple chemical interactions ensure limited leakage of Li+ ions during compression, and the collected water easily conforms to the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards. This work provides a flexible approach for sustainable atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar reliance through multi&#8208;mode synergy and gradient architecture.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired MXene Electrode with the Highly Interconnected Gradient Nanoconfined Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a bamboo&#8208;inspired gradient nanoconfined MXene (GNC&#8208;MX) electrode is designed. Combining the multiscale architecture, in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation for tunable interlayer channels, and scalable group&#8208;welding strategies, the thick GNC&#8208;MX electrodes achieved an ultra&#8208;high area&#8208;specific capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, which surpassing conventional MXene systems and validating the potential of gradient&#8208;confined architectures in practical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving efficient ion transport in thick electrodes remains a fundamental challenge in electrochemical systems with high energy density, primarily due to prolonged diffusion pathways and poorly integrated architectures. Leveraging the nanoconfinement effect, (sub)nanoscale channels can significantly accelerate ion transport kinetics to maximize electrochemical performance. Inspired by the hierarchical network structure of bamboo membrane, a gradient nanoconfined MXene electrode (GNC&#8208;MX) is designed, where multiscale interlayer spacing is coupled with in&#8208;plane mesopores that bridge adjacent nanoconfined channels, enabling synergistic vertical and horizontal ion migration. Finite element simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic optimization mechanism of ion transport via the gradient nanoconfined channels and in&#8208;plane mesopores. Compared to pristine MXene, GNC&#8208;MX electrodes exhibit substantially enhanced ion transport kinetics and charge storage performance. To optimize the nanoconfined channels, an in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation strategy is introduced to strengthen electrostatic repulsion and weaken hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the MXene interlayer, enabling quasi&#8208;permanent expansion of ion transport channels. Furthermore, a scalable group&#8208;welding method is developed to fabricate 400 &#181;m&#8208;thick electrodes with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, surpassing current MXene&#8208;based electrodes. This work provides a scalable and tunable biomimetic platform for advanced ion nanoconfinement in energy storage systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 Nanosheets for Enhanced Thermoelectric Catalytic&#8208;Ferroptotic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs, utilizing Cu self&#8208;doping and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 modified, can achieve decoupling and optimize thermal and electrical transport properties, thereby enhancing the TEC effect. Additionally, the presence of Cu at the Zn sites increases carrier concentration and enhances POD&#8208;like activity. When combined with ferroptosis, these features lead to efficient ROS generation and GSH depletion, resulting in satisfactory therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, a rapidly advancing field in medical therapy, encounters challenges in achieving efficient thermal and electrical transport properties within the limited thermal range compatible with biological systems. This study presents a high&#8208;performance thermoelectric catalytic therapy (TECT) utilizing Cu self&#8208;doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 nanosheets synthesized with non&#8208;stoichiometric ratios modified with DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 (n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs). Under 808 nm laser irradiation, n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs demonstrate an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.62%, rapidly establishing a significant local temperature gradient. This increase in temperature initiates thermoelectric catalysis (TEC), effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are toxic to cancer cells. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs at room temperature is observed to be 45.45% higher than that of pure phase CZTSe. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that lattice disorder and the presence of highly degenerate electronic bands at the band edges decouple thermal and electrical transport, enhancing the TEC effect. The additional copper ions at zinc sites increase carrier concentration, hole conductivity, and peroxidase&#8208;like activity, thereby enhancing ROS production, depleting glutathione, accelerating lipid peroxidation, and inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Consequently, a synergistic TECT and ferroptosis effect is achieved, resulting in significant anti&#8208;cancer efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;n-CZTSe@PEG NSs, utilizing Cu self-doping and DSPE-mPEG&lt;sub&gt;2000&lt;/sub&gt; modified, can achieve decoupling and optimize thermal and electrical transport properties, thereby enhancing the TEC effect. Additionally, the presence of Cu at the Zn sites increases carrier concentration and enhances POD-like activity. When combined with ferroptosis, these features lead to efficient ROS generation and GSH depletion, resulting in satisfactory therapeutic efficacy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric technology, a rapidly advancing field in medical therapy, encounters challenges in achieving efficient thermal and electrical transport properties within the limited thermal range compatible with biological systems. This study presents a high-performance thermoelectric catalytic therapy (TECT) utilizing Cu self-doped Cu&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets synthesized with non-stoichiometric ratios modified with DSPE-mPEG&lt;sub&gt;2000&lt;/sub&gt; (n-CZTSe@PEG NSs). Under 808 nm laser irradiation, n-CZTSe@PEG NSs demonstrate an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.62%, rapidly establishing a significant local temperature gradient. This increase in temperature initiates thermoelectric catalysis (TEC), effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are toxic to cancer cells. The thermoelectric figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of n-CZTSe@PEG NSs at room temperature is observed to be 45.45% higher than that of pure phase CZTSe. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that lattice disorder and the presence of highly degenerate electronic bands at the band edges decouple thermal and electrical transport, enhancing the TEC effect. The additional copper ions at zinc sites increase carrier concentration, hole conductivity, and peroxidase-like activity, thereby enhancing ROS production, depleting glutathione, accelerating lipid peroxidation, and inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Consequently, a synergistic TECT and ferroptosis effect is achieved, resulting in significant anti-cancer efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Amorphous Phases in Mixed Conduction of Conjugated Regioblock Copolymers for Organic Electrochemical Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical roles of amorphous and crystalline phases in polymer&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors for organic electrochemical synaptic transistors using conjugated regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom copolymers are demonstrated. Amorphous phases contribute to gradual polaron formation and strong ion trapping by bipolarons, leading to improved synaptic state modulation. The synaptic transistors with appropriate amorphous content exhibited low power consumption in the neuromorphic learning process.








Abstract
Growing interest in organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OECT&#8208;STrs) based on conjugated polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (CP&#8208;MIECs) has intensified, leading to the need to establish clear design rules and fundamentally understand the distinct roles of crystalline and amorphous domains in the electrochemical doping behavior of CP&#8208;MIEC films. Here, OECT&#8208;STrs based on regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom (regioblock) conjugated copolymers with precisely controlled crystallinity are demonstrated. The crystallinity of a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) regioblock copolymer is systematically tuned by varying the fraction of regiorandom blocks without altering the geometry or orientation of the crystalline phase. It is shown that incorporating an amorphous phase into the active channel of OECT&#8208;STrs significantly enhances the neuromorphic learning efficiency by improving modulation uniformity. This improvement results from sequential polaron formation in the amorphous regions and bipolaron formation in the crystalline domains during potentiation. Additionally, crystalline phases provide better state retention at low potentiation states, while amorphous phases contribute to improved long&#8208;term retention at high potentiation states by enhancing charge carrier localization through stronger Coulombic interactions. Neural network simulations based on actual device conductance demonstrate that OECT&#8208;STrs with a high amorphous fraction consume only 18% of the power required by devices with a highly crystalline film, owing to the need for fewer repetitive learning cycles.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cation Solvation Polymer Gel for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anodes in Rechargeable Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;cation polymer gel electrolyte (PVA/Lcys/Zr) is developed via cation coordination chemistry for rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries. The competitive solvaed Zr4+ reduces the water activity within the coordination shell of Zn2+ and promotes uniform zinc deposition along the (002) crystal plane, while Lcys weakens the interactions between PVA chains and creates a &#8220;sliding&#8208;rail&#8221; dynamic solvation structure that facilitates Zn2+ migration.








Abstract
In semi&#8208;open rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (RFZABs), the polymer gel electrolyte, influenced by high&#8208;water&#8208;activity solvation structures during cycling, experiences slow ion conduction and severe dendrite growth, significantly reducing the durability of the zinc anode. This limits its application and development in wearable RFZABs. Thus, modifying the traditional single Zn2+ solvation structure is crucial for enhancing anode stability. Here, a dual&#8208;cation solvation strategy is proposed that fundamentally redefines polymer gel electrolyte chemistry and zinc deposition behavior. By incorporating L&#8208;cystine (Lcys) as a dynamic modulator within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, Zn2+ and Zr4+ are coordinated to form a robust dual&#8208;metal solvation network, which imparts multiple functional advantages: i) competitive solvation by Zr4+ lowers water activity in the Zn2+ coordination shell, effectively suppressing dendritic growth; ii) weakened PVA chain interactions create a &#8220;sliding&#8208;rail&#8221; dynamic solvation structure enhancing Zn2+ migration; and iii) solvated Zr4+ and Zr3Zn1[(OH)2(H2O)4]48+ clusters cooperatively promotes uniform Zn deposition along the (002) crystal plane. As a result, Zn//Zn symmetric cells exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of 1628 h, and RFZABs demonstrate stable operation for over 212 h. This dual&#8208;cation solvation design offers a scalable and effective pathway for advancing durable, high&#8208;performance flexible energy storage systems.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Polyoxometalate Composites in Neutral pH Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Stable Organic Solar Cells via Mutual Doping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N))&#160;enable ultrahigh doping densities through distinct pathways: PMA&#8208;initiated polymerization yields PDA&#8208;PMA with&#160;organic/inorganic mutual doping, while ammonia&#8208;neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) shifts to&#160;organic&#8208;dominated doping&#160;via structural rearrangement. The neutral&#8208;pH PDA&#8208;PMA(N) eliminates energy barriers by enabling&#160;quantum tunneling, delivering&#160;OSCs with record 20.29% efficiency&#160;and&#160;exceptional stability, surpassing PEDOT:PSS.








Abstract
Heavy doping critically minimizes depletion region widths for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells (OSCs), yet systematic studies elucidating its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. To address this, two polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N)) are designed via innovative mutual doping pathways. PDA&#8208;PMA achieved ultrahigh doping density (1.17 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) through H3[P(Mo3O10)4] (PMA) initiated oxidative polymerization of dopamine, where electron transfer simultaneously induced p&#8208;doped PDA and n&#8208;doped PMA. Remarkably, neutralization with ammonia yielded PDA&#8208;PMA(N), which retained even higher doping density (3.74 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) via structural rearrangement&#8208;driven organic doping. XPS/ESR studies revealed distinct pathways: dual organic/inorganic doping in PDA&#8208;PMA versus organic&#8208;dominated doping in PDA&#8208;PMA(N). This deep doping compressed depletion region widths from 44.42&#160;nm in undoped controls (the blend of PDA and PMA) to 0.052&#160;nm (PDA&#8208;PMA(N)), surpassing PEDOT:PSS (0.238&#160;nm) and enabling barrier&#8208;free hole transport. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs with PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N) achieved exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.02% and 20.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) demonstrated superior stability (86.2% PCE retention after 1800&#160;h illumination) by suppressing interfacial corrosion. This work elucidates structure&#8208;dependent doping mechanisms and provides a universal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hole transport layers through tailored doping, advancing OSC commercialization.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Mediated Microenvironment Modulation of High&#8208;Density Fe&#8208;N4 Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction and Cryotolerant Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An S&#8208;mediated microenvironment modulation strategy is developed for Fe&#8208;N4 sites, synthesizing a Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeNSC) with optimized Fe&#8208;N4 density and electronic structure that exhibits exceptional oxygen reduction reaction activity. With FeNSC used as the cathode in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries, the batteries demonstrate high power density and extended low&#8208;temperature cycling stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) featuring Fe&#8208;N4 active sites hold significant potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, achieving high&#8208;density Fe&#8208;N4 active sites while precisely modulating their microenvironment to enhance ORR activity remains a formidable challenge. Here, an S&#8208;mediated strategy is presented for the preparation of Fe single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded S,N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNSC). This strategy leverages the interactions between S and N during pyrolysis to significantly suppress N loss, thereby achieving a high density of Fe&#8208;N4 sites. Concurrently, the precise doping of S into the second coordination shell of Fe&#8208;N4 centers modulates their electronic structure, leading to a significant weakening of *O and *OH intermediates adsorption during the ORR. Consequently, the FeNSC catalyst exhibits excellent pH&#8208;universal ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.928 V (0.1 M KOH), 0.806 V (0.1 M HClO4), and 0.755 V (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution).

Notably, it sustains continuous operation for over 940 h at &#8722;40 &#176;C, showcasing unprecedented cryotolerance. This work provides novel insights into the electronic microenvironment engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 sites in SACs for high&#8208;efficiency ORR and cryotolerant QSS&#8208;ZABs.

     alt="Sulfur-Mediated Microenvironment Modulation of High-Density Fe-N4 Sites for High-Efficiency Oxygen Reduction and Cryotolerant Quasi-Solid-State Zinc-Air Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An S-mediated microenvironment modulation strategy is developed for Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, synthesizing a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeNSC) with optimized Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; density and electronic structure that exhibits exceptional oxygen reduction reaction activity. With FeNSC used as the cathode in quasi-solid-state zinc-air batteries, the batteries demonstrate high power density and extended low-temperature cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) featuring Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites hold significant potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, achieving high-density Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites while precisely modulating their microenvironment to enhance ORR activity remains a formidable challenge. Here, an S-mediated strategy is presented for the preparation of Fe single-atom-loaded S,N-doped carbon (FeNSC). This strategy leverages the interactions between S and N during pyrolysis to significantly suppress N loss, thereby achieving a high density of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites. Concurrently, the precise doping of S into the second coordination shell of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers modulates their electronic structure, leading to a significant weakening of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OH intermediates adsorption during the ORR. Consequently, the FeNSC catalyst exhibits excellent pH-universal ORR performance with half-wave potentials of 0.928 V (0.1 M KOH), 0.806 V (0.1 M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and 0.755 V (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution). A FeNSC-based quasi-solid-state zinc-air battery (QSS-ZAB) achieves smooth operation over a broad temperature range of &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Notably, it sustains continuous operation for over 940 h at &#8722;40 &#176;C, showcasing unprecedented cryotolerance. This work provides novel insights into the electronic microenvironment engineering of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites in SACs for high-efficiency ORR and cryotolerant QSS-ZABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Epigenetic nanoagonist for multilevel T cell activation. a) DPM@iCARM1@siPVR assembly. b) Actions of the nanoagonist against PD&#8208;L1 &#8208; resistant tumors: 1) iCARM1 released in tumor cells activates cGAS&#8208;STING signaling for dendritic cell maturation, aiding T cell priming; 2) In T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXCR3; 3) SiPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells.








Abstract
Inefficient priming, poor recruitment, and inadequate reinvigoration of T cells challenges the therapy of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors. Herein, a pH&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanoplatform integrating coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibitor (iCARM1) and poliovirus receptor siRNA (siPVR) is developed. Upon tumor penetration, iCARM1 released in tumor cells facilitates T cell priming by epigenetically activating cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling&#8208;mediated dendritic cell maturation. Meanwhile, in T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXC&#8208;chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. The released siPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells. This epigenetic nanoagonist induces a robust immune response, dramatically suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse, and confers durable protection against secondary tumor challenge. Multiple PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant models demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy. This study thus represents an innovative approach for facilitating multilevel T cell responses to combat PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Additive Discovery with HOMO&#8208;Descriptor Enables Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries via Interfacial Kinetics Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>
A machine learning&#8208;guided strategy identifies 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an effective electrolyte additive for aqueous Zn batteries. By regulating interfacial kinetics and suppressing side reactions, DMAP enables uniform Zn deposition and exceptional cycling stability. This study offers a data&#8208;driven approach to interfacial engineering for durable and scalable aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Dendritic growth and parasitic reactions severely hinder aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to interfacial instability and uncontrolled charge transfer. Here, a machine learning&#8208;accelerated strategy for rational additive screening, establishing a predictive framework that links the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to the adsorption and reduction behavior of Zn2+, is reported. An interpretable machine learning model (Adaptive Boosting), trained on a curated molecular dataset, achieves high accuracy (Mean Squared Error = 0.2977, Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.8032) in HOMO prediction. Guided by this model, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine is identified as a high&#8208;performance additive, which can suppress Zn dendrite formation by slowing interfacial charge transfer and mitigating local ion starvation through kinetic matching between mass transport and deposition. Moreover, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine effectively excludes interfacial H2O molecules, significantly inhibiting parasitic reactions. Consequently, Zn anode delivers high reversibility of plating/stripping with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.85% over 1600 cycles. The 0.3&#8208;Ah NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O|Zn pouch cell delivers stable cyclability for 70 days, with a capacity retention of 73% after 250 cycles. This work pioneers the integration of machine learning with interfacial electrochemistry, offering a generalizable approach for additive discovery and electrolyte design, and sets a new paradigm for achieving dendrite&#8208;free metallic anodes in aqueous systems.

The combination of the metallic conductivity of MXene and the nanoporous structure of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;MOF ensures high electrochemical stability and ion accessibility, enabling dynamic surface reconfiguration for advanced applications in smart, adaptive, frequency-selective surfaces.

         <title>Smart Materials and Devices for Enhanced Delivery of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials and biomedical devices are increasingly used to overcome limitations in extracellular vesicle (EV) delivery. This review highlights recent advances in surface modification, exogenous and endogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, and device&#8208;assisted strategies including scaffolds, microneedles, hydrogels, and microfluidic platforms, to achieve precise, efficient, and targeted EV&#8208;based therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicle&#8208;like structures secreted by various cell types, playing a crucial role in cell communication. As an efficient and safe therapeutic carrier, EVs offer new insights and methods for disease treatment and drug development due to high stability, low immunogenicity, and broad resources. However, current applications on EV&#8208;based delivery systems are still challenging, and additional strategies are needed to achieve precise and targeted delivery, enhance stability and safety, and avoid unnecessary immune reactions or side effects.

         <title>The Versatility of Layered Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures for Energy Storage: Bridging Scientific Insights and Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>

This review highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures (HRs) in advancing monovalent ion&#8208;based energy storage. It examines their role in tailoring charge interactions mechanisms, optimizing interfacial properties, and overcoming the limitations of individual layered materials. Covering synthesis methods, structural designs, and electrochemical advances, the review offers insights into design strategies and challenges, positioning 2D HRs as promising anode materials. 









Abstract
Nanoscale manipulation of electronic and ionic charge interactions within electrode materials is the cornerstone for advancing electrochemical energy storage. Compared to bulk materials, 2D confined anodes provide lamellar channels to mobile ions for electrochemical interactions. However, individual 2D layers are often inefficient in delivering desired properties for stable and rapid kinetics in battery operations. To address this, 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures (2D HRs) that integrate the properties of two or more layers via van der Waals or covalent bonds can give optimized interfacial features. These structures modulate electronic properties, such as band positions, activation energies, diffusion barriers, and binding energies for intercalating ions, thereby regulating the electrochemical characteristics of batteries to meet practical challenges. In this context, this review includes the latest experimental and theoretical investigations to explore the multifunctional roles of 2D HRs in monovalent ion (Li+, Na+, and K+) batteries (MIBs). First, it elucidates the fundamentals concerning the impacts of HRs in charge storage mechanisms and outlines pathways for synthesizing their novel designs. Then, it summarizes the different configurations of 2D HRs utilized in designing MIBs. Finally, it underscores the current challenges and future perspectives for implementing 2D HRs as advanced anode materials in batteries.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic&#8208;layer thickness and exceptional properties, have garnered significant attention for next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. Among these, 2D antimony (Sb)&#8208;based materials distinguish themselves through outstanding physical properties, natural abundance, and remarkable stability. Despite their potential, a comprehensive review summarizing advancements in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials remains absent. This review addresses this critical gap by presenting an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent progress in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials, specifically, antimonene, antimony chalcogenides (Sb2X3, X = S, Se, Te), antimony oxides (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;Sb2O3, and SbO1.93), antimonides (e.g., NdSb2), and complex polycompounds such as quaternary CdSb2Se3Br2, focusing on their crystal structures, synthesis techniques, applications, and future prospects. By providing valuable insights into the potential of 2D Sb&#8208;based materials, our review aims to inspire further research into their practical applications and address the challenges that lie ahead for future electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Application of Novel Drug&#8208;Delivery Strategies in Neurological Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neurological disorders are the top cause of global health loss, but drug development faces major challenges, primarily due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). Other obstacles include gastrointestinal irritation, poor stability, rapid metabolism, imprecise targeting, and toxicity. Emerging drug&#8208;delivery strategies offer promising solutions. This review examines these challenges, explores innovative drug delivery strategies, and discusses their applications in neurological disorders.








Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of global health loss and disability. However, the success rate of drug development in the nervous system is very low, mainly because of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, gastrointestinal irritation, low stability, rapid metabolism, imprecise targeting, and organ toxicity of drugs are also important constraints in the development and application of neurological drugs. Emerging technologies, such as nano&#8208;delivery technology, offer a number of strategies to address these challenges drugs face entering the central nervous system. This review systematically introduces the various challenges of existing drug development in neurological disorders and summarizes BBB regulation strategies, drug delivery strategies, and modes of administration. It's summarized that the challenges of BBB can be addressed with the help of strategies including physical stimulation and modification of nanocarriers, and drug delivery in the nervous system can be achieved with the help of passive and active nanocarriers and self&#8208;assembly. Moreover, drug delivery strategies in major neurological disorders are discussed in detail. Finally, the limitations of some drug delivery strategies are summarized and the future development direction is prospected, which can provide new ideas and technologies for the optimization of drug delivery for neurological disorders.

         <title>Unveiling the Multifunctional Potential of MXenes in Rechargeable Batteries beyond Electrode Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides comprehensive perspectives on MXene's application as passive components in rechargeable battery systems, as current collectors, electrolytes additives, separators, binders, and hosts for active materials. It aims to forecast the multifunctional potential of MXenes in batteries, gain valuable insights into their broader applicability, and contribute to the innovation of energy storage systems.








Abstract
MXene materials have emerged as prominent candidates for revolutionizing energy storage technologies due to their unique properties and versatile applications. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of MXenes (beyond electrode active materials) in improving various components of rechargeable batteries. MXenes exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, tunable surface functionalities, and a 2D structure, rendering them suitable for enhancing electrode or electrolyte materials, current collectors, binders, and separators. As electrode hosts, MXenes accommodate active materials such as sulfur, silicon, selenium, and novel compounds, addressing challenges related to volume expansion, electronic conductivity, and chemical interactions. Furthermore, MXene&#8208;based conductive agents and additives ameliorate the stability and performance of solid&#8208;state devices, overcoming issues associated with flammable liquid electrolytes. MXene materials excel as current collectors by improving contact between active materials, mitigating dendrite formation, extending battery lifespan, and improving safety. Additionally, MXene&#8208;modified separators and interlayers effectively hinder the shuttle effect and dendrite growth in Li&#8208;S and other battery systems with stability and longevity. With their distinct attributes to offer transformative opportunities for addressing limitations in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, MXenes hold the promise of shaping a more efficient, secure, and sustainable energy storage landscape.

         <title>Functional Fluid&#8208;Based Soft Robotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluidic soft robots offer inherent safety, cost&#8208;efficiency, and adaptability, making them well&#8208;suited for wearable, medical, and bio&#8208;inspired applications. This review introduces functional fluid actuation technologies that convert electrical, magnetic, thermal, chemical, and acoustic energies into fluidic energy without mechanical movable components, enabling more flexible, compact, silent, and untethered soft robotic systems.








Abstract
Soft robots actuated by fluids offer a series of inherent benefits, including safe human&#8211;robot interaction, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and geometry adaptability for manipulating delicate objects, making them highly promising in wearable devices, medical equipment, and bio&#8208;inspired robots, etc. However, the foremost challenge in fluidic actuation lies in developing standardized, universal actuation methods that are flexible, portable, powerful, fast, low&#8208;cost, and safe, rather than still relying on existing rigid pumps and valves originally developed for traditional mechatronic systems. Recent advancements in responsive fluid materials have enabled the emergence of novel functional fluid actuation technologies that convert electrical, magnetic, thermal, chemical, and acoustic energies into fluidic energy without mechanical movable components. These technologies have great potential to provide flexible, portable, and powerful fluidic actuation customized for soft robotics. Here, functional fluid actuation generated from different energies, and their basic principles, structure designs, and robotic applications are introduced. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different functional fluid actuation are discussed, and their future trends are prospected. It is hoped this review can provide guidance for the development of fluidic actuation technology specifically tailored for soft robotics.

         <title>Artificial Optoelectronic Synapse Featuring Bidirectional Post&#8208;Synaptic Current for Compact and Energy&#8208;Efficient Neural Hardware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial optoelectronic synapse capable of generating bidirectional post&#8208;synaptic current is presented, eliminating the need for differential synapse pairs in HW&#8208;NNs. By utilizing an asymmetric metal contact structure and a charge trapping layer, it achieves precise control over current flow, demonstrating compatibility with MAC operations and promising superior performance in neuromorphic hardware systems.








Abstract
Conventional hardware neural networks (HW&#8208;NNs) have relied on unidirectional current flow of artificial synapses, necessitating a differential pair of the synapses for weight core implementation. Here, an artificial optoelectronic synapse capable of bidirectional post&#8208;synaptic current (IPSC) is presented, eliminating the need for differential synapse pairs. This is achieved through an asymmetric metal contact structure that induces a built&#8208;in electric field for directional flow of photogenerated carriers, and a charge trapping/de&#8208;trapping layer in the gate stack (h&#8208;BN/weight control layer) that can modulate the surface potential of the semiconductor channel (WSe2) using electrical signals. This structure enables precise control over the direction and magnitude of injected charge. The device demonstrates key synaptic behaviors, such as long&#8208;term potentiation/depression and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. A fabricated 3 &#215; 2 artificial synapse array shows that the bidirectional IPSC characteristic is compatible with multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Finally, the feasibility of these synapses in HW&#8208;NNs is demonstrated through training and inference simulations using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, yielding competitive recognition rates and reduced total energy consumption for updating weights of the weight core compared to unidirectional IPSC&#8208;based systems. This approach paves the way toward more compact and energy&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired computing systems.

         <title>Glaphene: A Hybridization of 2D Silica Glass and Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Glaphene&#8217;, a novel hybrid material combining 2D silica glass and graphene, is synthesized via a scalable liquid precursor&#8208;based vapor&#8208;phase growth. This study reveals interlayer hybridization beyond van der Waals interactions, leading to emergent semiconducting behavior. Extensive spectroscopy and microscopy demonstrate a strong electronic proximity effect, highlighting charge redistribution at the interface. This work expands the 2D materials toolbox, enabling new possibilities for electronic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D materials provide ideal platforms for breakthroughs in both fundamental science and practical, real&#8208;world applications. Despite the broad diversity of 2D materials, most integration efforts have focused on&#160;homo/hetero&#8208;structural stacking and Janus structures. In this paper, we introduce &#8220;glaphene&#8221;&#8212;a hybrid of two fundamentally different materials: 2D silica glass and graphene. We propose a metastable hybrid structure based on first&#8208;principles calculations, synthesize it via scalable liquid precursor&#8208;based vapor&#8208;phase growth, and chemically validate the interlayer structure and hybridization using extensive optical and electron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. Using probe microscopy, we reveal that electronic cloud redistribution at the interface&#8212;beyond conventional van der Waals interactions&#8212;drives interlayer hybridization via a strong electronic proximity effect. By reconstructing the energy level diagram of glaphene through both theory and experiment, we&#160;show that the combination of semi&#8208;metallic graphene (Eg&#8776;0&#160;eV) and insulating 2D silica glass (Eg, exp&#8776;8.2&#160;eV, Eg, th&#8776;7&#160;eV) results in a semiconducting &#8220;glaphene&#8221; (Eg, exp&#8776;3.6&#160;eV, Eg, th&#8776;4&#160;eV) formed through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz hybridization. This work paves the way for scalable, bottom&#8208;up methodologies to bring interlayer hybridization and its emergent properties to the 2D materials toolbox.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Controlled Growth of Molybdenum Phosphide Single Crystals for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;controlled growth of molybdenum phosphide single crystals via liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition, demonstrating MoP nanoplate and pillar morphologies formed at different temperatures for efficient hydrogen peroxide synthesis.








Abstract
Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) stand out for their excellent catalytic activity, driven by metal&#8210;phosphorus bonding that promotes electron donation, which makes them ideal for electrocatalysis applications. However, the synthesis of single&#8208;crystal TMP, which is essential for elucidating intrinsic properties, remains challenging owing to the lack of efficient methods, low yields, and lengthy processes. This study presents the synthesis of facet&#8208;controlled molybdenum phosphide (MoP) single crystals using a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method. By adjusting the synthesis temperature, two distinct MoP morphologies are created: nanoplates dominated by (0001) facets and pillars dominated by (101&#175;0)$( {10\bar 10} )$ facets. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the MoP pillars outperform nanoplates in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, achieving over 92% selectivity for H2O2 production and significantly higher kinetic current density. Long&#8208;term stability tests confirm that the MoP pillars maintain a high Faradaic efficiency (&gt;90%) and stable electrosynthesis over 80&#160;h of continuous operation, highlighting their robustness.

&lt;p&gt;Facet-controlled growth of molybdenum phosphide single crystals via liquid-metal-assisted chemical vapor deposition, demonstrating MoP nanoplate and pillar morphologies formed at different temperatures for efficient hydrogen peroxide synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) stand out for their excellent catalytic activity, driven by metal&#8210;phosphorus bonding that promotes electron donation, which makes them ideal for electrocatalysis applications. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMP, which is essential for elucidating intrinsic properties, remains challenging owing to the lack of efficient methods, low yields, and lengthy processes. This study presents the synthesis of facet-controlled molybdenum phosphide (MoP) single crystals using a liquid-metal-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. By adjusting the synthesis temperature, two distinct MoP morphologies are created: nanoplates dominated by (0001) facets and pillars dominated by (101&#175;0)$( {10\bar 10} )$ facets. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the MoP pillars outperform nanoplates in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, achieving over 92% selectivity for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and significantly higher kinetic current density. Long-term stability tests confirm that the MoP pillars maintain a high Faradaic efficiency (&amp;gt;90%) and stable electrosynthesis over 80&#160;h of continuous operation, highlighting their robustness. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the (101&#175;0)$( {10\bar 10} )$ facets of the pillars enhance catalytic activity by reducing the OOH adsorption strength, thereby lowering the overpotential. This study underscores the importance of facet engineering in optimizing catalytic performance and provides a pathway for designing advanced TMP-based materials for energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance GaN/BAs Heterojunctions: Dual Functionality of BAs for Enhanced Electrical and Thermal Management in Power Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of BAs with GaN via surface&#8208;activated bonding yields a high&#8208;quality heterojunction with rectification ratio of &gt;107. Atomic&#8208;scale interface analysis reveals that an optimized amorphous layer enhances the electrical performances. BAs serves as both an active p&#8208;type semiconductor and a high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductive substrate in GaN/BAs heterojunction, highlighting its potential for high&#8208;power&#8208;density applications.








Abstract
Benefit from the unusually outstanding thermal and electrical transport properties, the integration of cubic boron arsenide (BAs) with other semiconductors presents a promising avenue for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, assemblage of BAs&#8208;based devices poses significant challenges due to constraints in BAs growth conditions. In this study, gallium nitride/BAs (GaN/BAs) heterojunctions are fabricated using the surface&#8208;activated bonding method, achieving high&#8208;quality interfaces. The heterojunctions demonstrate a rectification ratio exceeding 107, with atomic characterizations revealing enhanced performance at intermediate layer thicknesses below 20 nm. On the thermal front, BAs significantly improve heat dissipation outperforming GaN configurations under identical conditions. The fabrication of dual&#8208;functional BAs&#8208;based structures, where BAs works as an active p&#8208;type semiconductor and an efficient cooling substrate simultaneously, highlights its potential for next&#8208;generation power electronics, where both electrical performance and thermal management are crucial.

         <title>Biomimetic Engineering of Hybrid Radiosensitizers to Boost Radiotherapy against Cancer Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer is engineered by integrating the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug banoxantrone and CeO2 nanozymes into mesoporous silica&#8208;coated Bi2O3 nanoparticles, followed by camouflage coating with cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;derived membranes. The biomimetic radiosensitizer substantially improves the radiosensitization efficacy of both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells and markedly suppresses lung metastasis through reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Over the past 120&#160;years, significant efforts are dedicated to delivering maximum radiation doses to tumor sites while sparing adjacent normal tissues as much as possible. Despite encouraging progress in the development of heavy metal&#8208;based nanoscale radiosensitizers, radiotherapy often fails to fully eradicate hypoxic tumors, leading to local recurrence or even progression to distant metastasis. In this study, a versatile biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer is engineered by integrating the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug banoxantrone and CeO2 nanozymes into mesoporous silica&#8208;coated Bi2O3 nanoparticles (NPs), followed by camouflage coating with cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;derived membranes. Compared to naked Bi2O3 NPs and free banoxantrone alone, the radiosensitization efficacy of the biomimetic NPs is substantially enhanced toward both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Moreover, lung metastasis is markedly inhibited by reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix through the activity of CeO2 nanozymes. As confirmed by in vitro and in vivo results, the biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer enhances radiotherapy against lung metastasis with fewer side effects. This study provides compelling evidence for the development of next&#8208;generation radiosensitizers with optimized functionalities using biomimetic hybrid engineering to finely balance the benefits and risks of radiotherapy.

         <title>Toward Stable, High&#8208;Energy, Partially Disordered Mn&#8208;Rich Spinel Cathodes by Revealing and Mitigating Surface Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;activated partially disordered spinel LiMn2O4 is demonstrated with high Mn utilization and a specific energy over 800 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at the cathode active material (CAM) level. Surface degradation, caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect in baseline commercial carbonate electrolyte (Gen 2), intensifies Mn2+ dissolution and crosstalk at high potentials. Advanced electrolytes effectively mitigate these issues, thus minimizing Li&#8208;ion inventory loss.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich cathodes balance performance and sustainability but suffer from limited cyclability due to Mn dissolution and cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk. The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect of Mn3+ is often linked to the above phenomena, such as in spinel LiMn2O4. However, in typical voltage ranges, significant Mn3+ only appears near the end of discharge, highlighting the need to reassess its role in driving Mn dissolution, structural degradation, and battery performance. Here, the spinel cathode's degree of disorder is tailored to expand the Mn redox range, enabling segmentation into J&#8208;T active and less active voltage ranges. Cycling at segmented voltage windows reveals surface degradation mechanisms with and without the major J&#8208;T effect. Despite a stronger J&#8208;T effect below 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+, Mn dissolution is less significant than above 3.6 V. Expanding the cycling window to 2.0&#8211;4.3 V causes severe degradation as the J&#8208;T active range induces a tetragonal phase and Mn2+&#8208;rich surface, driving Mn dissolution and consuming Li&#8208;ion inventory in full cells. Reducing electrolyte acidity minimizes Mn3+ disproportionation, enabling a stable dopant&#8208;free Mn&#8208;only cathode with a 250 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 specific capacity. These findings demonstrate that full cells using Mn&#8208;rich cathodes have the potential to avoid the notorious crosstalk problem through electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Observation of N&#233;el&#8208;Skyrmions in Bilayered Oxide Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the evolution of ferroelectric skyrmion&#8208;bubbles with thickness, revealing pure N&#233;el&#8208;type ferroelectric skyrmions in ultrathin bilayer oxide films. The stability of these pure N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions is primarily governed by electric and gradient energy variations, establishing them as the electrical counterparts of magnetic skyrmions and pushing the size limits of topological phases.








Abstract
Skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials exhibit either N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics. Although skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials can be readily obtained via inter&#8208;spin interactions, a skyrmion in ferroelectric materials exhibiting solely N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics has not yet been discovered. Here, by modulating the formation of skyrmion&#8208;bubbles in [(PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n]1 [(PTOn/STOn)1] bilayers grown on STO substrates, the atomic morphology of pure N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmion is observed with a topological charge of &#177; 1 in the ultrathin bilayered films with the thickness of 2 unit cells (u.c.). Such a pure N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmion is confirmed by a combination of atomic mappings, geometric phase analysis, and X&#8208;ray 3D reciprocal space mapping (RSM). It is found that decreasing the thickness of bilayered films from 50 to 2 u.c., the characteristics of skyrmion&#8208;bubbles exhibiting both N&#233;el and Bloch features disappear along with the Bloch features. The formation mechanism of the N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmions is unveiled using Phase&#8208;field simulations, showing the critical role of electric and gradient energy variation in the stable phase of N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmions.

     alt="Observation of N&#233;el-Skyrmions in Bilayered Oxide Ferroelectrics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study elucidates the evolution of ferroelectric skyrmion-bubbles with thickness, revealing pure N&#233;el-type ferroelectric skyrmions in ultrathin bilayer oxide films. The stability of these pure N&#233;el-type skyrmions is primarily governed by electric and gradient energy variations, establishing them as the electrical counterparts of magnetic skyrmions and pushing the size limits of topological phases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials exhibit either N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics. Although skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials can be readily obtained via inter-spin interactions, a skyrmion in ferroelectric materials exhibiting solely N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics has not yet been discovered. Here, by modulating the formation of skyrmion-bubbles in [(PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/(SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [(PTO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/STO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] bilayers grown on STO substrates, the atomic morphology of pure N&#233;el-skyrmion is observed with a topological charge of &#177; 1 in the ultrathin bilayered films with the thickness of 2 unit cells (u.c.). Such a pure N&#233;el-skyrmion is confirmed by a combination of atomic mappings, geometric phase analysis, and X-ray 3D reciprocal space mapping (RSM). It is found that decreasing the thickness of bilayered films from 50 to 2 u.c., the characteristics of skyrmion-bubbles exhibiting both N&#233;el and Bloch features disappear along with the Bloch features. The formation mechanism of the N&#233;el-skyrmions is unveiled using Phase-field simulations, showing the critical role of electric and gradient energy variation in the stable phase of N&#233;el-skyrmions. These nanoscale pure N&#233;el-skyrmions represent the electrical equivalents of their magnetic counterparts, extending the size limits of topological phases and offering potential advancements in the field of ferroelectric physics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A PROTAC&#8208;Based Cuproptosis Sensitizer in Lung Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS is developed in this work, which sensitizes cells to cuprotosis by modulating the p53 pathway through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome systemcan. CuS&#8208;MD@CS not only can effectively deplete endogenous glutathione but also can promote the transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, thereby enhancing cancer cells' sensitivity to cuproptosis and achieving effective therapeutic effects of cuprotosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
As an autonomous form of regulated cell death, cuproptosis depends on copper (Cu) and mitochondrial metabolism. However, the principle metabolic pathway known as glycolysis (Warburg effect) and high glutathione (GSH) levels of tumor cells inevitably lead to suboptimal efficacy in cuproptosis. Hence, depleting the endogenous GSH within tumors and shifting from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration are crucial factors for augmenting cuproptosis. In this study, a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer (CuS&#8208;MD@CS) is innovatively constructed, which not only can induce cuproptosis and reactive oxygen species production via copper ions but also can regulate the expression of p53 protein via PROTACs through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in tumor cells, thus achieving endogenous GSH depletion and a shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, making cancer cells more sensitive to cuproptosis. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo experiments have verified that CuS&#8208;MD@CS effectively targets A549 cells and suppresses tumor growth through cuproptosis and apoptosis, exhibiting promising therapeutic responses. The novel PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS provides a new strategy for sensitizing cuproptosis and offers new hope for effective lung cancer treatment.

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Spin Relaxation Time in van der Waals GeSe With Gate&#8208;Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the layered nature of GeSe, the carrier transport direction is effectively restrict, resulting in giant spin lifetimes. This leads to efficient spin injection at room temperature and gate tunable spin transport at low temperatures. Additionally, the results suggest that GeSe is the only air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor suitable for spin transport channels at room temperature.








Abstract
The 2D materials are promising channel materials for spin transistors due to their natural spatial&#8208;confined carrier transport character. Nonetheless, electrical spin injection and detection in 2D semiconductors used to be challenging. This study reports high&#8208;efficient spin injection and transport in 2D GeSe, which exhibits moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and extended spin diffusion lengths due to the van der Waals structure. The non&#8208;local magnetoresistance (MR) measurements show a maximum spin polarization of 18.31%, a long spin diffusion length of 255.98&#160;nm, and a giant spin relaxation time of 17.6&#160;ns at room&#8208;temperature. After cooling to 4.3 K, the elevated spin diffusion length further increases to 397.04&#160;nm, with an elevated spin polarization of 25.38%, leading to the successful observation of local MR in a two&#8208;terminal lateral spin valve. Additionally, the spin transport characteristics are also tunable by gate voltages due to the field&#8208;dependent SOC and Rashba spin relaxation. This study highlights GeSe as an air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor with anisotropic and gate&#8208;tunable spin transport capability. The results will remove the barriers to developing novel spintronic devices based on emerging 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Exclusive Encapsulation Adhesive in a Neutral&#8208;Plane Model for Ultrahigh Mechanical Stability of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detachment behavior between the adhesives and the electrodes are always caused by significant interlayer shear stress during bending in neutral plane flexible perovskite solar cells (NP&#8208;FPSCs). A crosslinkable polymer named acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is introduced to form a stable network, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability &#8212; the most mechanically stable devices reported to date.









Abstract
The functional layers of flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are subjected to significant stress during bending, causing structural failure and declining power conversion efficiency. To alleviate stress, a neutral plane (NP) is introduced by positioning the functional layers at the center of the device, with top metal electrode encapsulated by a protective layer. However, adhesive detachment remains a critical issue during multiple bending cycles, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, a systematic analysis of the detachment behavior in NP&#8208;FPSC reveals that commercial adhesives with high Young's modulus and low adhesion strength struggle to withstand interlayer shear stress during bending, which triggers detachment between adhesives and electrodes. To address this issue, a crosslinkable polymer acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is designed with long linear polyisoprene main chain and acrylate side chains, providing high flexibility and reduced chain segment movement. AIR can be crosslinked under UV irradiation to form a stable network with ultralow Young's modulus and high adhesion strength, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs, constructing stable NP&#8208;FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability, retaining 92.8% of their initial efficiency after 50&#8201;000 bending cycles at a radius of 4 mm, meeting the IEC 62715&#8208;6&#8208;3 standards.

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Defects Act as a Free Surface: Role in Formation and Photophysical Properties of CsPbI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) defects in vapor&#8208;deposited CsPbI3 thin films using electron microscopy, density functional theory, and optoelectronic measurements. The atomic positions at the planar defect are found comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilization. While RP planes are electronically benign, antisites observed at RP corners are likely to be malign.









Abstract
The perovskite semiconductor, CsPbI3, holds excellent promise for solar cell applications due to its suitable bandgap. However, achieving phase&#8208;stable CsPbI3 solar cells with high power conversion efficiency remains a major challenge. Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here, the prevalence of RP defects is increased with increased Cs&#8208;excess in vapor&#8208;deposited CsPbI3 thin films while&#160; superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties are observed. Significantly, using electron microscopy, it is found that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. Therefore it is proposed that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points offers a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here can apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.

Significantly, using electron microscopy, it is found that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. Therefore it is proposed that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points offers a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here can apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Li&#8208;SbF3@Cu Alloying Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin Li&#8208;SbF3@Cu anode with topological structure and adjustable thicknesses/capacities (5.5&#8208;30 &#181;m, 0.93&#8208;5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2) is rationally designed via low&#8208;cost and scalable tape casting. Benefiting from the excellent electrolyte tolerance, strong lithiophilicity, and optimized volume/deposition regulation, the Li&#8208;SbF3@Cu anode ensures long&#8208;term interfacial/structural stability under high Li utilization and achieves 400 Wh kg&#8722;1&#8208;level Li metal batteries at a low N/P ratio of 1.5.








Abstract
The ultrathin Lithium (Li)&#160;alloying anode (&#8804; 50&#160;&#181;m) plays a key role in advancing rechargeable Li metal batteries into practical use, especially because of the insurmountable difficulties in developing pure Li anode. Herein, a thickness&#8208;controllable (&#8776;5.5&#8211;30&#160;&#181;m) and topological Li&#8208;SbF3@Cu anode with the embedded dual Li&#8208;based (Li3Sb and Li&#8208;Cu) alloys and outmost LiF&#8208;rich layer is prepared for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under high Li utilization. Upon cycling, the surface LiF&#8208;rich layer together with inner lithiophilic Li3Sb sites and ferroconcrete&#8208;like Li&#8208;Cu skeletons, synergistically regulates the Li deposition/dissolution behaviors and Li/electrolyte interface evolution. The assembled Li&#8208;SbF3@Cu symmetric cell can cycle stably over 1200&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2, and realize an ultrahigh discharge/charge depth of 53.6% at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a full cell with a high&#8208;Li&#8208;capacity LiCoO2 cathode (3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2) delivers an energy density of 394.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with impressive cycling reversibility at a low negative/positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.5. All the findings provide a rewarding avenue toward the industrial application of high&#8208;Li&#8208;utilization alloying anodes for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>A Hydrophobic and High Surface Charge Phosphate Interphase for High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrophobic and high&#8208;surface&#8208;charge phosphate interphase dramatically fosters uniform Zn deposition at the (100) plane, realizing an unprecedented Sand's capacity of over 64 mAh cm&#8722;2. The synergy of a narrower Zn2&#8314;&#8208;rich electric double layer and suppressed side reactions delivers stable Zn metal batteries with high areal capacity, long lifespan, and practical viability.








Abstract
Commercial zinc metal batteries require an areal capacity above 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at high rates. However, such performance is rarely reported due to slow mass transport between the diffuse layer and the outer Helmholtz layer at the interface. Herein, it is reported an unprecedented Sand's capacity exceeding 64 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, enabled by a hydrophobic and high surface charge iron/zinc phosphate (FZP) nanofilm serving as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase for zinc anode. It is identified the key role of high surface charge with strong Zn2&#8314; affinity, which mitigates depletion zones by forming a narrower and Zn2+&#8208;rich electric double layer, thereby achieving high areal capacities and promoting preferential exposure of the Zn (100) plane. Consequently, FZP/Zn exhibits stable cycling for 400 h under 60% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (2.14 mAh cm&#8722;2). Full cells with a low N/P ratio deliver an energy density of 176.5 Wh kg&#8722;1 electrodes at 6 mAh cm&#8722;2. The practical Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cells are further demonstrated with &#8776;97 Ah of cumulative capacity and a high areal capacity of 5.12 mAh cm&#8722;2. These findings establish FZP nanofilms as a viable strategy for realizing commercial high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Dependent Magnon Torques in All&#8208;Sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnon torques can overcome the Joule heating issue in traditional spintronic devices. The crystalline dependence of magnon torques in Hf/Cr2O3/FM heterostructures is demonstrated. Magnon torques are generated when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 is parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf. Furthermore, the magnetization switching of perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB is achieved using magnon torques.








Abstract
Electron motion in spin&#8208;orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet is fabricated and demonstrates that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the N&#233;el vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be &#8722;0.134 using in&#8208;plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB is achieved, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 &#215; 107 A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. The work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.

         <title>Multitarget Generate Electrolyte Additive for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a deep learning&#8208;assisted generative model for electrolyte additives in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The approach overcomes data scarcity by proposing the molecular categorization method and achieves 100% generative efficiency. The model led to the discovery of 2,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene, a flame&#8208;resistant additive that significantly improves capacity retention, offering a promising solution for safe and high&#8208;performance LMBs.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are crucial for accelerating the commercialization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet designing effective additives is challenging due to the need to balance conflicting properties, such as eectrochemical performance and nonflammability. To address this challenge, a deep learning&#8208;assisted generative model is developed for multiobjective optimization of electrolyte additives. Overcoming data scarcity, the dataset is expanded using a molecular categorization derivation method, increasing single&#8208;property data points to 70&#8201;095 multiproperty data points. Coupled with an asynchronous limited decoder and adversarial regulation strategy for latent distribution, this approach achieved 100% generative efficiency for structurally complex and diverse molecules in vast chemical space. The method is validated by discovering 2,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene (DFEPN), a novel additive with excellent flame resistance and stable dual electrode/electrolyte interphases. In a Li||LiFePO4 full cell with a commercial electrolyte, DFEPN enables an order of magnitude increase in capacity retention, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flame&#8208;retardant additive ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene by 33%. This study offers a pathway for developing safe and reliable lithium battery electrolytes, particularly under severe data constraints, and has broader implications for advanced battery design.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a deep learning-assisted generative model for electrolyte additives in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The approach overcomes data scarcity by proposing the molecular categorization method and achieves 100% generative efficiency. The model led to the discovery of 2,4-bis(2-fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene, a flame-resistant additive that significantly improves capacity retention, offering a promising solution for safe and high-performance LMBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolyte additives are crucial for accelerating the commercialization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet designing effective additives is challenging due to the need to balance conflicting properties, such as eectrochemical performance and nonflammability. To address this challenge, a deep learning-assisted generative model is developed for multiobjective optimization of electrolyte additives. Overcoming data scarcity, the dataset is expanded using a molecular categorization derivation method, increasing single-property data points to 70&#8201;095 multiproperty data points. Coupled with an asynchronous limited decoder and adversarial regulation strategy for latent distribution, this approach achieved 100% generative efficiency for structurally complex and diverse molecules in vast chemical space. The method is validated by discovering 2,4-bis(2-fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene (DFEPN), a novel additive with excellent flame resistance and stable dual electrode/electrolyte interphases. In a Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell with a commercial electrolyte, DFEPN enables an order of magnitude increase in capacity retention, outperforming the state-of-the-art flame-retardant additive ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene by 33%. This study offers a pathway for developing safe and reliable lithium battery electrolytes, particularly under severe data constraints, and has broader implications for advanced battery design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Morphotropic Phase Boundary in Irradiated Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation rather than composition is used to induce helix/trans morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectric polymers. Markedly enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is achieved in ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymers. This postprocessing approach is generally applicable to different ferroelectric polymer compositions and sources of irradiation, offering a scalable tool to design of ferroelectric polymers with high piezoelectric properties.








Abstract
Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) enables a large piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric polymers. However, till now MPB has only been observed in a few polymers, which is induced by compositional tuning of the polymer composition. Here a distinct approach to design MPB in ferroelectric polymers is reported via ion irradiation. Without changing composition as required by the conventional compositional approach, the formation of helix/trans MPB in ferroelectric polymers is achieved upon increasing the irradiation dose, near which a substantially enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is observed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by using different sources of irradiation and polymer compositions, which offers a general and scalable postprocessing tool to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric polymers.

         <title>Designing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Disordered Materials Via Color Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
What if disorder can be designed? This work introduces a strategy to self&#8208;assemble amorphous materials by designing bonding rules for patchy particles that suppress crystallinity and promote frustration. The designer particles nucleate a network of dodecahedral cages from the liquid, yielding a novel equilibrium amorphous phase. This approach redefines how disorder and function can be programmed at the colloidal scale.








Abstract
The ability to control self&#8208;assembly with atomic&#8208;level precision has led to remarkable advances in the rational design of crystalline materials. However, similar design strategies have yet to be developed for amorphous materials. Here, a strategy is devised for programming the self&#8208;assembly of amorphous structures by encoding frustration into the building block design. The building blocks are tailored to locally favor the formation of five&#8208;member rings and yield a network of face&#8208;sharing dodecahedral cages whose icosahedral symmetry prevents long&#8208;range order. Surprisingly, unlike geometrically frustrated glasses that form through kinetic arrest, the network nucleates spontaneously from the liquid phase, representing a novel type of thermodynamically stable disordered phase. The stabilization of this frustrated phase via programmable interactions paves the way for a new generation of disordered&#160;materials.

         <title>Concentration Indicator Kit Based on Dandelion Propagation&#8208;Inspired SERS Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concentration indicator kit based on dandelion propagation&#8208;inspired SERS strategy is developed for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection of drug residues in urine, which is a simplified and reliable SERS&#8208;based detection method and offers a promising platform for bedside testing in medical diagnostics.









Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology has been extensively employed for the detection of liquid samples in the biomedical field due to high sensitivity and non&#8208;invasive characteristics. However, quantitative SERS detection is hindered by sophisticated instrumentation and complex calibration procedures, while qualitative analyses often provide insufficient concentration information for clinical diagnosis. Herein, a concentration indicator kit based on dandelion propagation&#8208;inspired SERS strategy is developed for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection of drug residues in urine. This strategy achieves significant signal enhancement through the synergistic effects of optimized hotspot construction and molecular adsorption, resulting in an analytical enhancement factor of 2.503 &#215; 10&#8309;, which is 4143 times greater than that of silver nanoparticles. An innovative phenomenon termed the &#8220;concentration indicator&#8221; is discovered, wherein the SERS signal is dramatically enhanced at specific indicated concentrations while remaining weak at adjacent concentrations. The practical utility of this kit is validated through the detection of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole in urine samples. The kit exhibits excellent performance in semi&#8208;quantitative detection of standard solutions and simulated samples at high, indicated, and low concentrations. The concentration indicator opens new avenues for the development of simplified and reliable SERS&#8208;based detection, offering a promising platform for bedside testing in medical diagnostics.

         <title>Origami Crawlers: Exploring A Single Origami Vertex for Complex Path Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the nonlinear kinematics of origami sheets can be exploited to realize crawlers capable of multimodal locomotion under a single actuation input. In particular, it focuses on one of the simplest origami building blocks &#8208; a rigid degree&#8208;four vertex &#8208; and identifies designs that enable movement in a straight line as well as turning left or right by simply controlling the folding range of the actuated fold.








Abstract
The ancient art of origami, traditionally used to transform simple sheets into intricate objects, also holds potential for diverse engineering applications, such as shape morphing and robotics. In this study, it is demonstrated that one of the most basic origami structures&#8211;a rigid, foldable degree&#8208;four vertex&#8211;can be engineered to create a crawler capable of navigating complex paths using only a single input. Through a combination of experimental studies and modeling, it is shown that modifying the geometry of a degree&#8208;four vertex enables sheets to move either in a straight line or turn. Furthermore, it is illustrated that leveraging the nonlinearities in folding allows the design of crawlers that can switch between moving straight and turning. Remarkably, these crawling modes can be controlled by adjusting the range of the folding angle's actuation. This study opens avenues for simple machines that can follow intricate trajectories with minimal&#160;actuation.

         <title>Homogeneous &#8220;Hard&#8208;Soft&#8221; Biphasic Bone Adhesives Promote Comminuted Fracture Healing through Interfacial Adaptation and Mechanical Property Maintenance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the instant and sustainable fixation of bone fragments in treating highly comminuted fractures, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard&#8208;soft biphasic bone adhesive (PTN). The conversion of tetracalcium phosphate in the hard phase and the deposition of hydroxyapatite in the soft phase endow its anti&#8208;swelling and mechanical resistance while adapting to the interfacial changes for sustainable adhesion.








Abstract
Bone adhesives provide remarkable clinical solutions in treating highly comminuted fractures that are difficult to perform surgery with metal fixation.

&lt;p&gt;For the instant and sustainable fixation of bone fragments in treating highly comminuted fractures, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard-soft biphasic bone adhesive (PTN). The conversion of tetracalcium phosphate in the hard phase and the deposition of hydroxyapatite in the soft phase endow its anti-swelling and mechanical resistance while adapting to the interfacial changes for sustainable adhesion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone adhesives provide remarkable clinical solutions in treating highly comminuted fractures that are difficult to perform surgery with metal fixation. However, no commercial bone adhesives exhibit high adhesion, strength, and osteogenic activity for instant and sustainable fixation in dynamic, wet humoral environments at weight-bearing sites. Here, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard-soft biphasic bone adhesive (HB-PTN) with a sea urchin-inspired structure of phosphorylated polyglutamic acid (P-PGA) encapsulating tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) (hard phase) and a viscoelastic hydrogel composed of amino-functionalized PEGylated poly (glycerol sebacate) (PEGS-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and P-PGA (soft phases) for immediate, stable fixation. The adhesion and strength of the HB-PTN hydrogel can be tuned by modulating the soft phase/hard phase ratio. The PTN-2 hydrogel exhibited an adhesive strength of &#8776;280 kPa, a compressive modulus of &#8776;1.02 MPa, and high fatigue resistance (92%). Moreover, the PTN-2 hydrogel showed limited swelling (130%) and maintained mechanical properties (102%) after immersion in simulated human body fluid. Furthermore, this strategy avoids the agglomeration of inorganic particles and the formation of cracks due to stress concentration observed with traditional mixing methods. In vivo, the PTN adhesives reveal durable and stable adhesion and accelerate fracture healing, demonstrating great clinical potential in comminuted fracture repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directly Evolved Nanovaccines Modulate Disrupted Circadian Rhythm and Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly evolved biovesicles are developed as biological clock&#8208;modulated nanovaccines (Clock&#8208;NVs) to augment circadian gene expression in tumors, enhance mitochondrial metabolism and antigen processing in dendritic cells for amplified antitumor immune responses, and potentiate the antitumor efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 and adoptive T cells in multiple cancer mice models.








Abstract
The circadian rhythm, as a crucial endogenous biological oscillator, often undergoes disruptions, thus fostering severe immunosuppression within tumors. Here, this work develops directly evolved biovesicles as biological clock&#8208;modulated nanovaccines (Clock&#8208;NVs) to augment circadian clock gene expression and enhance cancer immunotherapy. These biovesicles act as bioreactors, transforming an unfavorable factor, ROS, into a beneficial circadian clock enhancer, oxygen. By targeting HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;BMAL1 axis, Clock&#8208;NVs restore the disrupted circadian rhythm within tumors. Upregulation of the core clock gene, BMAL1, initiates tumor cell death, enhances mitochondrial metabolism and antigen processing in dendritic cells to amplify antitumor immune responses. Clock&#8208;NVs effectively inhibit tumor growth, diminish metastasis, and demonstrate robust antitumor activity in a model of chemotherapy&#8208;resistant senescent tumors. Notably, Clock&#8208;NVs combined with adoptive T cell&#8208;based therapies achieve a 60% regression of primary tumors, while their use with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 results in 100% inhibition of tumor recurrence. This strategy introduces nanovaccines designed to enhance temporal immunotherapy by precisely restoring the suppressed rhythm gene expression within tumors.

Abstract
Advancing clinical diagnostics requires platforms that combine catalytic efficiency, biocompatibility, and real&#8208;time, in vivo accessibility. Herein, this study reports a structurally integrated FePc&#8211;ZIF&#8208;8&#8211;MX nanozyme that combines the redox activity of FePc, the porous confinement of ZIF&#8208;8, and the electrical conductivity of MX. Synthesized via a low&#8208;energy, ambient&#8208;condition process, this hybrid enables efficient electron transfer, enhanced analyte enrichment, and sustained catalytic activity in physiological environments. To translate this functionality into a wearable diagnostic format, the hybrid is seamlessly incorporated into a microneedle array, offering minimally invasive access to interstitial fluid for continuous L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) monitoring. The resulting platform exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity across complex biological matrices, including serum, urine, cultured cells, and a murine model of myocardial infarction. This study presents a multifunctional electrochemical platform that enables on&#8208;body metabolite monitoring through a microneedle&#8208;integrated nanozyme interface. To the best of our knowledge, it constitutes the first realization of real&#8208;time, in vivo L&#8208;Cys sensing in this format, setting a new benchmark for precision biosensing in translational healthcare.

         <title>Precisely Tuning 3D/Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Heterojunctions in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, 3D/2D or 3D/quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterojunctions with tunable energy levels and uniform n&#8208;values are developed. The well&#8208;refined heterogeneous structure effectively mitigates the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and facilitates carrier extraction at the WBG perovskite/C60 interface. As a result, the optimized WBG PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells exhibit improved performance and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite sub&#8208;cells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (AP&#8208;TSCs) suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage loss and poor light stability. The formation of 3D/2D or 3D/quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterojunctions can effectively passivate interface defects and optimize energy level alignments at the 3D perovskite/C60 interface, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, a combined evaporation/solution technique is employed to construct Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D or quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with uniform&#8208;phase distribution on wide&#8208;bandgap 3D perovskite substrates. By tuning the n values of the DJ phase perovskites, well&#8208;refined WBG 3D/2D or quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterostructures are achieved, which exhibit tunable energy levels and mitigate the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses at the WBG 3D perovskite/C60 interface. The devices with the WBG (1.78&#160;eV) 3D/quasi&#8208;2D n = 3 perovskite heterostructures achieve the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.71% (certified 20.53%). When combined with narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskite sub&#8208;cells, the fabricated 2&#8208;terminal AP&#8208;TSCs achieve a PCE of 28.99% (certified 28.81%). The tandem device maintains 80% of its initial PCE after 501&#160;h of operation at maximum power point.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Confined DNAzyme Coordination&#8208;Facilitated Logical Engineering for Precise Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a new DNA logical processing strategy based on cell surface&#8208;confined DNAzyme coordination for high&#8208;precision engineering and identification of cells. This strategy integrates the advantage of spatially&#8208;confined DNA&#8208;based reactions and allows for concurrently and logically analyzing multiple cell surface proteins, and demonstrates successful application even in tumor tissues from breast and lung cancer patients.








Abstract
DNA logical processing, which employs DNA as a building block to perform logic operations, attracts considerable attention in biomedical applications. Herein, a new DNA logical processing strategy is explored for selective cell engineering and to develop a feasible technology for precise cell identification. Specifically, this cell identification technology accomplishes logical engineering through the employment of cell surface&#8208;confined DNAzyme coordination, which not only enables the labeling of versatile DNA probes at specific cells but also avoids false&#8208;positive outputs caused by the neighboring non&#8208;target cells. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, this cell identification technology achieves precise magnetic isolation and electrochemical determination of specific cancer cells (i.e., stem cell&#8208;like subpopulations in breast cancer). When further applied to tumors taken from mouse models, this technology exhibits accuracy comparable to that of flow cytometry; however, it is simple to operate and offers superior recognition capabilities for revealing multiple biomarkers. More importantly, this cell identification technology can be successfully applied in tumor tissues from breast cancer and lung cancer patients, demonstrating satisfactory practicability. Therefore, this work may provide new insights for the precise identification of cells, especially cancer cells, and is expected to offer technical support for clinical diagnosis and related biomedical research.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA logical processing, which employs DNA as a building block to perform logic operations, attracts considerable attention in biomedical applications. Herein, a new DNA logical processing strategy is explored for selective cell engineering and to develop a feasible technology for precise cell identification. Specifically, this cell identification technology accomplishes logical engineering through the employment of cell surface-confined DNAzyme coordination, which not only enables the labeling of versatile DNA probes at specific cells but also avoids false-positive outputs caused by the neighboring non-target cells. In proof-of-principle studies, this cell identification technology achieves precise magnetic isolation and electrochemical determination of specific cancer cells (i.e., stem cell-like subpopulations in breast cancer). When further applied to tumors taken from mouse models, this technology exhibits accuracy comparable to that of flow cytometry; however, it is simple to operate and offers superior recognition capabilities for revealing multiple biomarkers. More importantly, this cell identification technology can be successfully applied in tumor tissues from breast cancer and lung cancer patients, demonstrating satisfactory practicability. Therefore, this work may provide new insights for the precise identification of cells, especially cancer cells, and is expected to offer technical support for clinical diagnosis and related biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Cu&#9472;Co Dual&#8208;Sites in Cobalt Oxide Nanoboxes for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration NO to NH3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO presents a promising avenue for NH3 production, offering a sustainable solution to environmental challenges. Cu&#9472;Co dual&#8208;sites in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are developed for NO electroreduction, boasting a Faraday efficiency of 94.13% and an NH3 yield of 54.28 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. A Zn&#8208;NO battery has also been successfully demonstrated for simultaneous NO elimination, NH3 generation, and power output.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) epitomizes an advanced approach in NH3 synthesis, crucial for efficiently converting low&#8208;concentration industrial NO exhaust and contributing significantly to environmental preservation. Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, efficient Cu&#9472;Co dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO reduction reaction (NORR). Cu&#8208;modified cobalt oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4) and its heterophase interface with copper oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO) both exhibit over 93% Faraday efficiency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust (1 vol %) as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu significantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. The integration of Cu&#8208;Co3O4 and Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO within the cathode of the Zn&#8211;NO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm&#8722;2, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;concentration NO exhaust gas.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Wearable Sweat Sensing Patch for Online Analysis of Multiple Parkinson's Disease&#8208;Related Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully integrated wearable sweat&#8208;sensing patch capable of real&#8208;time detection of three critical PD&#8208;related biomarkers: L&#8208;Dopa, ascorbic acid, and glucose is presented. The system integrates a biomimetic microfluidic module for sedentary sweat collection, an advanced electrochemical sensing platform for biomarker detection, on&#8208;site signal processing circuitry for data handling, and custom software for real&#8208;time data visualization.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by a prolonged asymptomatic &#8220;window period&#8221; (several years). Early prediction and diagnosis during this window are crucial, as timely interventions can slow disease progression. In this study, a fully integrated wearable sweat&#8208;sensing patch capable of real&#8208;time detection of three key PD biomarkers: L&#8208;Dopa, ascorbic acid, and glucose is developed. The system includes a biomimetic microfluidic module for sedentary sweat collection, an advanced electrochemical sensing platform for biomarker analysis, on&#8208;site signal processing circuitry for data management, and custom software for real&#8208;time data visualization. A universal strategy is proposed to significantly extend the stability of oxidase enzymes without activity loss, achieved through the design of Cu&#8208;oxidase hybrid nanoflowers. The patch is successfully tested on dozens of volunteers (healthy and PD patients in various stages), demonstrating its capability to monitor biomarkers in real time, assess PD progression, and optimize medication management.

A lithium&#8208;free battery is designed by integrating a graphite|TiS2 pouch cell with a standard electrolyte modified by lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). Through electrochemical activation, the additive liberates Li ions without compromising structural stability or leaving detrimental residues. An unprecedented cycle life exceeding 14&#8201;000 cycles is achieved at a high current rate of 10C.








Abstract
Energy storage batteries are pivotal for enabling reliable integration of renewable energy systems, yet further advancements in their longevity and rate performance remain imperative. Lithium (Li)&#8208;free cathode materials, while offering exceptional electrochemical stability, rate capability, and cost efficiency, face a critical limitation: the absence of active Li ions when paired with conventional graphite anodes. To address this challenge, a Li&#8208;free battery design is presented that integrates a graphite|TiS2 pouch cell architecture with a standard electrolyte modified by lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). This additive serves as an in situ Li&#8208;ion reservoir, electrochemically releasing Li ions during operation without generating deleterious residues or compromising structural integrity. The optimized cell achieves an unprecedented cycle life exceeding 14&#8201;000 cycles at a high current rate of 10C, alongside remarkable sustainability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This work establishes a practical pathway for deploying long&#8208;lasting, fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;free batteries in grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Deep Reconstruction of RuPdOx Hollow Nanofibers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and deep reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers to generate RuO2/Pd heterostructure is achieved to regulate the local electronic environment of catalyst during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) processes. Thus the obtained material exhibits exceptional ampere&#8208;grade&#8208;current&#8208;density HER and HzOR properties, enabling significnat energy&#8208;saving H2 production performance.








Abstract
Manipulating the reconstruction of a heterostructured material is highly desirable to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic performance. Here, an in situ reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers (HNFs) is presented to generate RuO2/Pd from both the electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes. The reconstructed catalyst is highly efficient for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at industrial&#8208;grade current densities, significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, it maintains a record&#8208;breaking durability of 500 h for HzOR at 1 A cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, with the catalyst as electrodes, a two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) cell is constructed, which requires only 0.263 kWh of electricity to produce 1 m3 H2 at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than that in overall water splitting (OWS) system (4.286 kWh m&#8722;3 H2), exhibiting an exceptional energy&#8208;saving H2 production property. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an efficient electron transfer from Pd to RuO2 at their interface from the reconstruction of RuPdOx HNFs, which regulates the local electronic environment of atoms, modulates the adsorption and desorption for intermediates, and reduces the energy barriers for enhancing the electrocatalytic process. This study offers a robust reconstruction strategy for the design of electrocatalysts that exhibit superior efficiency in energy conversion devices.

         <title>Lightweight and Superelastic Wood Carbon Sponges Enabled by Wood Cell Wall Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;stripping&#8208;expansion&#8208;carbonization&#8221; strategy is proposed to reconstruct the cell wall architecture and fabricate a lightweight, superelastic wood carbon sponge. The core of this strategy lies in disrupting weak interlayer connections and establishing a stable wavy lamellar structure through cell wall softening and vacuum&#8208;assisted expansion. This wood carbon sponge with exceptional performance serves as a versatile platform for applications in sensing, electromagnetic interferenceshielding, oil absorption, and beyond.








Abstract
Elastic wood carbon sponges have gained increasing momentum due to their combination of compressive elasticity, wood orientation structure, and carbon nature. However, the pursuit of lightweight and superelasticity in these sponges remains a significant challenge, as their boundaries are constrained by the solidified wood cell walls. Here, an innovative &#8220;stripping&#8208;expansion&#8208;carbonization&#8221; strategy is proposed for producing wood carbon sponges with low density and superelasticity via breaking the spatial confinement of the original cell wall. This strategy integrates the removal of non&#8208;skeletal components from cell wall, the formation of bubble&#8208;assisted lamellar structure, and a high&#8208;temperature carbonization process. The resultant expanded wood carbon sponges (EWCS) demonstrate a low density of 14.18 &#177; 1.07 mg cm&#8722;3, temperature&#8208;insensitive superelasticity, and reliable cycling stability. Additionally, the incorporation of the lightweight, electrical conductivity, and superelasticity nature endows EWCS with remarkable versatility, enabling applications such as pressure sensor for monitoring human movement, tunable electromagnetic interference shielding, and efficient and recyclable oil&#8208;water separation. This strategy realizes the layer&#8208;wise reconfiguration of the solid wood cell structure, providing a new design route for engineering wood carbon sponges.

         <title>Enhanced Kinetics and Stability of Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with a Multifunctional TiO2 Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2&#8208;coated MnO2 cathodes enhance the cycling stability and capacity of zinc&#8208;ion batteries by improving kinetics and inhibiting Mn dissolution. The multifunctional TiO2 coating forms a coherent interface with MnO2, creating an electron&#8208;enriched surface that promotes rapid electron/ion transport and proton&#8208;dominated reactions. Additionally, the coating mitigates Mn dissolution and buffers volume changes, offering a promising solution for advanced energy storage.









Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are a promising energy storage alternative, offering safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environment&#8208;friendliness. MnO2 is appealing for its high capacity and output voltage, but it suffers from slow kinetics and poor stability due to severe Mn dissolution during cycling. Here, the performance of MnO2 is enhanced by coating it with a uniform TiO2 nanolayer that incorporates oxygen vacancies. The TiO2&#8208;MnO2 heterogeneous interface results in the formation of Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds and a reduction in the interfacial valence state, thereby leading to the creation of an interface electron&#8208;enriched region that facilitates faster electron and ion transport. This multifunctional TiO2 coating not only promotes proton&#8208;dominated electrochemical reactions and ion diffusion but also acts as a protective barrier, preventing Mn dissolution and buffering volume changes during cycling. Consequently, the MnO2@TiO2 cathode demonstrates excellent specific capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and cycling stability, achieving 91.4% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 and 92.7% capacity retention after 600 cycles at a low current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1. These results outperform many previously reported manganese&#8208;based cathodes, demonstrating MnO2@TiO2&#8217;s potential as a high&#8208;performance and durable cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion batteries and advancing the development of efficient energy storage solutions.

         <title>From Physical Cross&#8208;Linking to Tailored Phosphorylation: Unlocking High&#8208;Performance and Biocompatible Xanthan&#8208;Konjac Hydrogels for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte, is crafted from xanthan gum and konjac gum through physical crosslinking and targeted phosphorylation. This design balances mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, enabling Zn//MnO&#8322; batteries with long cycle life and high Coulombic efficiency. Its biocompatibility and biodegradability offer a sustainable solution for flexible, wearable energy storage electronics.








Abstract
Natural polymer&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes, though biocompatible and cost&#8208;effective, often exhibit poor mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, limiting their use in high&#8208;performance energy storage. Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte derived from xanthan gum (XG) and konjac glucomannan (KGM), has been developed via physical cross&#8208;linking and targeted phosphorylation. Specifically, physical cross&#8208;linking forms a robust 3D network that provides a stable structural foundation. Building on this, the phosphorylation process introduces phosphate monoesters (MPE) and diesters (DPE) in a precisely controlled ratio. MPE groups enhance ionic conductivity by facilitating Zn2+ desolvation and ion migration, while DPE strengthens mechanical integrity through enhanced cross&#8208;linking. These distinct roles of MPE and DPE are confirmed through both theoretical calculations and experimental results. Optimizing the phosphorylation ratio achieves a balance between mechanical strength (2.524&#160;MPa) and ionic conductivity (20.72 mS cm&#8722;1), resulting in remarkable electrochemical performance, including an extended cycle life exceeding 3000 h and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.45% in Zn//Cu batteries. Moreover, Phos&#8208;XK is biocompatible and biodegradable, ideal for sustainable energy storage. This work highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based materials to overcome the limitations of traditional hydrogel electrolytes and stresses the importance of molecular engineering in achieving high&#8208;performance, eco&#8208;friendly energy storage.

         <title>A Bipolar Solvent Molecule Design for Wide&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An S&#8208;F group is directly grafted onto the SO2 group in the sulfone solvent, enabling rapid defluorination and decomposition of the solvent to form a robust SEI layer dominated by inorganics, thereby effectively isolating the LMA. The design ensures stable operation of Li&#8208;metal full cells from ambient to extreme conditions, offering a novel perspective for the molecular engineering of electrolytes tailored for Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Integrating Li metal anode (LMA) with a high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode is considered a pragmatic path in the pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage systems. Yet, their practical application is still plagued by suboptimal cycling behavior. Numerous reports have already upgraded the cycle life of Li metal batteries (LMB) through anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI), but the adverse consequence brought by the inevitable decomposition of organic solvents is often underestimated. Here, a bipolar solvent molecule (1&#8208;Butanesulfonyl fluoride, BSF), is engineered by fusing an F&#8208;SO2 polar head for dissociating Li salts and contributing to the construction of EEI, along with a (CH2)4 nonpolar tail to lower molecular polarity and enhance wettability. Within the BSF&#8208;based electrolyte, FSI&#8722; anions and BSF coexist in the Li+ solvation shell, jointly contributing to the development of inorganic&#8208;rich EEI. Supported by robust interphases and expedited interfacial kinetics, the Li||NCM811 full cells (N/P = 1.05&#8211;1.8) exhibit favorable electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to +55&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a 5.2 Ah Li metal pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte (1.9&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) delivers an energy density of 470&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and achieves 100 stable cycles.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Form Stretchable Hydrogels with Banded Spherulites and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites are developed by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites are obtained in soft gels. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance, affording the gels with circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Reported here is the synthesis of stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites of different morphologies by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. By varying the concentrations of chemical crosslinker and initiator, or the light intensity for photopolymerization, the stiffness of polyacrylamide network is tunable to regulate the crystallization of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8&#8208;ether molecules that form spherulites in the hydrogels. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites with twisted crystal fibers are obtained in soft gels. The structure of spherulites is investigated by microscopy and scattering measurements. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance. The gels with regular spherulites show stronger fluorescence and phosphorescence than those with banded spherulites. A remarkable fact is that the latter gels exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor up to +1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2. This luminescence arises from the clusterization&#8208;triggered emission of the network constrained by the crystals, while the twisted fibers render the achiral clusterluminogens with CPL. The mutual influences between polymer network and crystal growth account for the collective functions of the composite gels. The design principle and chiral transfer mechanism should open opportunities for developing other soft materials with tailored crystals and optical properties.

         <title>Natural Design of a Stabilized Cross&#8208;&#946; Fold: Structure of the FuA FapC from Pseudomonas Sp. UK4 Reveals a Critical Role for Stacking of Imperfect Repeats</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a 3.2 &#197; cryoEM structure of functional amyloid protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4, an essential component of bacterial biofilm, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament, supports bioinformatically determined motifs, nuances AlphaFold predictions, emphasizes heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding and shows strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. FapC fibrils are intrinsically catalytic. This provides a structural foundation to design novel biomaterials.








Abstract
An essential structural component of bacterial biofilms is functional amyloid (FuA), which also has great potential as an engineerable nano&#8208;biomaterial. However, experimentally based high resolution structures of FuA that resolve individual residues are lacking. A fully experimentally based 3.2 &#197; resolution cryo&#8208;electron microscopy density map of the FuA protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4 is presented, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament. The structure supports bioinformatic identification of conserved motifs and is broadly consistent with the AlphaFold prediction but with important modifications. Each FapC monomer consists of three imperfect repeats (IRs), with each repeat forming one cross&#8208;&#946; layer. An array of highly conserved Asn and Gln residues with an extensive H&#8208;bonding network underpins this conserved Greek key&#8208;shape and reveals the role of heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding. The covariation of residues in the hydrophobic core among different IRs suggests a cooperative monomer folding process during fibril elongation, while heterogeneous stacking of IRs reduces charge repulsion between layers to stabilize the monomer fold. The FapC fibrils show intrinsic catalytic activity and strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. Combined with mutagenesis data, the structure provides mechanistic insights into formation of FapC FuA from disordered monomers and a structural foundation for the design of novel biomaterials.

         <title>Bioinspired, Rapidly Responsive Magnetically Tunable Stiffness Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D array of magnetoactive mechanical metamaterials enables rapid and reversible stiffness modulation under external magnetic fields. By adjusting field direction and intensity, the system exhibits diverse deformation modes and tunable modulus. This fast&#8208;responding mechanical metamaterial offers real&#8208;time adaptability for advanced reconfigurable and load&#8208;bearing applications.








Abstract
Programmable mechanical materials often require dynamic stiffness adaptability, but existing solutions face challenges with slow response times and limited precision. This study introduces magnetically tunable stiffness metamaterials (MTSM) that utilize a bioinspired ternary programming framework to achieve rapid and precise stiffness modulation. Drawing inspiration from biological sarcomeres, which naturally adjust stiffness through structural changes, the MTSM design employs direct ink writing, a 4D printing method, to incorporate neodymium microparticles and a styrene&#8208;isoprene&#8208;styrene polymer matrix. This approach enables the metamaterial to transition between three distinct stiffness states&#8212;soft, moderate, and stiff&#8212;through structural deformation controlled by magnetic torque. Integration of MTSM into a 3D array further enhances its versatility, allowing multi&#8208;layer stiffness adjustments under magnetic fields. The MTSM array achieves an impressive 390 percent stiffness modulation range and rapid changes in response to an external magnetic field, surpassing the limitations of prior designs. These findings emphasize the potential of ternary programming in MTSM as a foundation for creating next&#8208;generation programmable mechanical systems capable of rapid and efficient adaptability.

         <title>Overall Performance Improvement of Perovskite Green LEDs by CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 Nanocrystals and Molecular Doping</title>

         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;additive strategy regulates perovskite crystallization, enabling CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 dual&#8208;phase nanocrystals and nanoscale concave&#8208;convex morphology with polarity tuning via molecular doping. The resulting PeLEDs achieve record performance: 28.2% EQE, 4291&#160;h T50 lifetime, 16.5&#160;nm linewidth, and&#160;92% Rec. 2020 gamut coverage, surpassing prior benchmarks in efficiency, stability, and color purity.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites hold great promise for display technologies owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Recent advances in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have improved their efficiency, brightness, and operational stability, but simultaneously boosting these metrics remains challenging. Additionally, other critical metrics such as power consumption, color purity, and gamut have received little attention. Here, a co&#8208;additive approach is proposed to regulate the perovskite crystallization, enabling the synthesis of CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 dual&#8208;phase nanocrystals (NCs) and the formation of nanoscale concave&#8208;convex morphology, as well as to change its semiconductor polarity by molecular doping. Due to the reduced defect density, balanced charge injection, and improved light extraction efficiency, the PeLEDs achieve a remarkable external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.2%, a high brightness of over 150000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a T50 lifetime of 4291&#160;h, along with an ultra&#8208;narrow spectral linewidth (16.5&#160;nm), an ultra&#8208;low driving voltage (1.9&#160;V), and a superior Rec. 2020 color gamut coverage (CGC) of 92%.

         <title>Native Defect Elimination and Lattice Framework Reinforcement Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional solid&#8208;phase sintered samples have native surface defects, mainly consisting of lattice mismatches and elemental distortions, and pose problems of TM dissolution and crack growth during subsequent cycles. With an understanding of the spatial distribution of the defects and an appreciation of the importance of the surface state, a strategy of surface defect elimination and crystal framework enhancement is applied and demonstrated to provide strong stability of the cathodes treated by this strategy.








Abstract
Structural and performance degradation in layered transition metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials is often attributed to phase transition induction during sodium de&#8208;embedding, while the significance of native defects during complex synthesis is frequently overlooked. Here, the role of native surface remodeling in progressive capacity degradation in P2&#8208;type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is emphasized, where lattice mismatches and elemental distortions are found on the surface of the particles and result in the accumulation of low&#8208;valent TMs. Interestingly, the accumulation gradually became the center of cathodic degradation rather than phase transition induction. Given the apparent spatiality of the primary defects and recognizing the importance of the surface state, the stripping repair of the defects and gradient introduction of La can be manipulated. The unique LaO6 configuration enhanced the rigid framework of TMO6 and suppressed the emergence of low&#8208;valent TMs, resulting in surface&#8208;corrected and reinforced particles, which can be explained by generalized functional density calculations and ex&#8208;situ hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the reinforced cathode brought about a capacity retention of up to 98% for 500 cycles at 2 C and 87% for 4000 cycles at 10 C and stable electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Highly Robust and Conductive Polymer Electrodes for Droplet Energy Harvesting and Printable On&#8208;Skin Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is developed by using PBFDO as the electrical phase and TPU as the mechanical phase, featuring exceptional properties including high conductivity, mechanical toughness, robustness, stretchability, stability, recyclability, and biocompatibility. Leveraging the capabilities of the BC&#8208;PE, a record high&#8208;performance droplet electricity generator and a self&#8208;powered electronic skin for the human&#8208;machine interface are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conductive polymers have exhibited promising electrical properties. However, their brittleness and unsatisfactory mechanical characteristics have hindered their creation of flexible electrodes. Here, a robust bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is reported that features a stable and high electrical conductivity (&gt;60&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), remarkable stretchability (&gt;600%), high fracture strength (&gt;57 MPa), excellent toughness (&gt;230&#160;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), recyclability, and biocompatibility. The BC&#8208;PE is fabricated by facilely blending a high&#8208;conducting polymer poly(benzodifurandione)(PBFDO) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Serving as a flexible electrode for a droplet electricity generator, a record high current density of 29.2 A m&#8722;2 and a power density of 1124.2 W m&#8722;2 have been attained. Moreover, the versatility of the BC&#8208;PE is validated by the direct ink writing technique, and a soft, thin, BC&#8208;PE&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic skin is demonstrated for touch&#8208;track recognition. This work presents a straightforward strategy for the development of advanced conductive polymer electrodes that well address the tradeoffs between conductivity and mechanical properties, showcasing their promising applications in energy harvesting and on&#8208;skin human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Spin Transport in Chiral Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that in chiral gold film, spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by the Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. The spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates spin effective lifetime on the order of nanoseconds.








Abstract
Any attempt to use spintronics&#8208;based logic elements will need to have spin interconnects to transfer information between its elements. Typically, the mean free path of an electron's spin in metals, at room temperature, is of the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Here chiral gold films are used to demonstrate that spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by a Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. It is verified that the spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates a spin&#8208;effective lifetime in the order of nanoseconds. A theoretical model is presented that involves the anisotropic electronic polarizability of the system, its spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and spin exchange interactions.

         <title>Catalytically Active Light Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scale 3D&#8208;printed multi&#8208;material structures incorporating photocatalytically active Ru(II) sites using a dual&#8208;function photoresin is introduced. The system utilizes a Ru(II)&#8208;functionalized monomer, enabling the assembly of 3D structures with commercially available crosslinkers. The catalytic activity is demonstrated through the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced additive manufacturing (3D printing) has revolutionized manufacturing and its integration into the fabrication of catalysts holds key potential to enable facile access to optimized catalyst geometries and designs. Herein &#8211; for the first time &#8211; micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;sized photocatalytically active 3D printed objects are introduced via a dual&#8208;function photoresin using a ruthenium(II) complex containing monomer as both a photoinitiator for the 3D printing process and as the active photocatalyst within the printed structure. The approach leverages the spatial and temporal control afforded by light&#8208;induced 3D printing techniques during both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon printing to precisely position the photocatalyst within intricate geometries using a pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) based resin. The successful incorporation of ruthenium(II) complexes is demonstrated via time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) into desired sections of 3D&#8208;printed objects. The one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon fabricated architectures show photocatalytic activity in the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides. The potential of tailored catalytically active 3D objects is exemplified by one of the microscale designs. This design, utilizing only 1% of the volume of a macroscale structure fabricated from the same resin, achieved 75% of the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Constructing Immunomodulator Biosynthesis Factory in Grafting&#8208;From DNA Hydrogel for Heart Valve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis factory is constructed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs) through a grafting from DNA hydrogel, utilizing tailored rolling circle amplification (RCA) on DHVs. Anti&#8208;coagulation NU172 aptamers are incorporated into the hydrogel to recruit heme from the bloodstream and heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) is encapsulated to convert heme into biliverdin, achieving long&#8208;term immune regulation and valve regeneration.








Abstract
The development of heart valve prostheses with regenerative capabilities offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of existing commercial artificial valves in clinical practice. Immune modulation plays a crucial role in heart valve regeneration by reversing the coagulation and inflammatory microenvironment, thereby facilitating recellularization. In this study, a biosynthesis factory is constructed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs) to continuously convert the abundant heme in the blood into immunomodulators, supporting long&#8208;term immune modulation and tissue regeneration. This biosynthesis factory is achieved through a grafting from DNA hydrogel, utilizing tailored rolling circle amplification (RCA) on DHVs. Anti&#8208;coagulation NU172 aptamers are incorporated into the DNA hydrogel to recruit heme from the bloodstream, while heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) is encapsulated to simultaneously convert heme into biliverdin. This system ensures the sustained production of biliverdin, facilitating anti&#8208;inflammatory immune modulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, thus creating a regenerative immune microenvironment. Additionally, the DNA coating is further crosslinked with zwitterionic polymers, which protect the functional DNA layer and provide anti&#8208;calcification and anti&#8208;adhesion properties. This comprehensive design promotes full endothelial cell coverage and significant extracellular matrix remodeling within one&#8208;month post&#8208;implantation.

In this study, a biosynthesis factory is constructed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs) to continuously convert the abundant heme in the blood into immunomodulators, supporting long-term immune modulation and tissue regeneration. This biosynthesis factory is achieved through a grafting from DNA hydrogel, utilizing tailored rolling circle amplification (RCA) on DHVs. Anti-coagulation NU172 aptamers are incorporated into the DNA hydrogel to recruit heme from the bloodstream, while heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is encapsulated to simultaneously convert heme into biliverdin. This system ensures the sustained production of biliverdin, facilitating anti-inflammatory immune modulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, thus creating a regenerative immune microenvironment. Additionally, the DNA coating is further crosslinked with zwitterionic polymers, which protect the functional DNA layer and provide anti-calcification and anti-adhesion properties. This comprehensive design promotes full endothelial cell coverage and significant extracellular matrix remodeling within one-month post-implantation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetically Controlled Mechanical Cutting of Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a transformative strategy of mechanical cutting water by magnetically manipulating a hydrophobic sphere moving across hydrophobic particles&#8208;encapsulated water (HPEW). The patterned HPEWs manufactured by mechanical cutting are designed as open millifluidic chips with various interdisciplinary applications in biochemical assays, chemical synthesis, and 3D cell culture.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the cutting of water using mechanical forces remains challenging due to water's inherent surface tension and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. Inspired by the effortless movement of water striders, a strategy is developed involving magnetic manipulation of a hydrophobic sphere across hydrophobic particle&#8208;encapsulated water (HPEW). Stable mechanical cutting of water is first demonstrated by coating its surface with hydrophobic particles (silica nanoparticles, paraffin, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) and maintaining the water thickness below 1&#160;mm. Through systematic theoretical and numerical analyses, it is clarified how water thickness and particle distribution influence cutting performance and accuracy. Moreover, a magnetically controlled approach is established for precise cutting, creating versatile open millifluidic chips suitable for diverse applications such as biochemical assays, chemical synthesis, and 3D cell culture. The approach thus offers a robust platform with wide&#8208;ranging implications in materials science, chemistry, physics, biomedical engineering, and microfluidics.

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Polymer Efficiently Driving Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells by Covalent Grafting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent grafting strategy is proposed to fabricate a lamellar COP network COP@G, which is achieved by edge&#8208;functionalizing COP with aromatic primary amine groups, followed by diazotization reactions and covalent attachment of graphene dispersions. COP@G demonstrates an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in maximum power density compared to van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;carbon composites in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cell device.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) have emerged as promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to their structural tunability and well&#8208;defined active sites. However, their practical application is hindered by inherent electrical conductivity and restricted active site accessibility in bulk configurations. While van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;carbon composites enhance conductivity, persistent stacking, and weak interfaces still impede electron/mass transport during ORR. Herein, a covalent grafting strategy is proposed to fabricate a lamellar COP network COP@G, which is achieved by edge&#8208;functionalizing COP with aromatic primary amine groups, followed by diazotization reactions and covalent attachment of graphene dispersions. The resulting hybrid exhibits significantly improved active site accessibility and a tenfold increase in conductivity compared to pristine COP. As a result, in 0.1&#160;M HClO4, COP@G delivers an exceptional acidic ORR performance, with a record half&#8208;wave potential of 801&#160;mV, surpassing van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;G by 194&#160;mV. When integrated into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) cathodes, COP@G demonstrates an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in maximum power density compared to conventional COP&#8208;carbon composites.

Doping Ru into the interstices of &#946;&#8208;MnO2 significantly enhances the performance as a photocathode for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In a simulated oxygen environment with 57% relative humidity, the batteries achieved an exceptional round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.4%, a prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 720 h, and stable operation at a high current density of 1000 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries, which utilize solar energy to reduce overpotentials, have attracted significant interest. However, challenges such as sluggish redox kinetics, limited photogenerated carrier availability, excessive byproduct formation, and oxygen evolution constraints persist. This study integrates computational and experimental approaches to demonstrate that Ru doping at interstitial sites in &#946;&#8208;MnO2 induces lattice expansion, introduces additional reactive sites, enhances light absorption, and accelerates redox reaction kinetics. Under simulated conditions (57% relative humidity), the battery achieves an impressive 98.4% round&#8208;trip efficiency, excellent high&#8208;rate performance, and exceptional cycling stability over 720 h with reversible four&#8208;electron conversion to LiOH. Furthermore, stable operation under real atmospheric conditions marks the first demonstration of a photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 battery based on a four&#8208;electron process. These findings provide new insights into advancing the practical implementation of Li&#8208;O2 batteries for efficient energy storage applications.

         <title>Broadband Excitation from X&#8208;Ray to UV for Afterglow Emission in Monodisperse Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Nanoengineered Molecular Nanotransducers</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyan and green long&#8208;afterglow luminescence in NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@SiO2 is achieved through a molecular doping strategy under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation, respectively. The rationally designed structure of NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@4&#8208;PP&#8208;doped SiO2 NCs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding and physical interactions, stabilizes the triplet state of 4&#8208;PP, thereby enabling afterglow emission under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation. This approach expands the library of optical codes for information encryption.








Abstract
The rational design of uniform afterglow nanoparticles (NPs) is critical for applications such as bioimaging and information storage. However, excitation of afterglow NPs remains largely limited to either X&#8208;ray or UV light. Integrating both X&#8208;ray&#8208; and UV&#8208;responsive afterglow components into a single NP platform remains a major challenge. Here, a broadband excitation strategy (X&#8208;ray to UV) is reported for afterglow emission using lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoengineered molecular nanotransducers. A 4&#8208;phenylpyridine (4&#8208;PP)&#8208;doped SiO2 shell is grown on NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4 NPs. The SiO2 shell is first coated onto the core, then functionalized via hydrothermal reaction with 4&#8208;PP. Hydrogen bonding and physical interactions between 4&#8208;PP and the SiO2 matrix enable blue afterglow emission at 472&#160;nm with a 2.41 s lifetime under 290&#160;nm excitation. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, high&#8208;energy photons induce defect formation in the NaLuF4:Tb3+ core, where stored energy is transferred to Tb3+ ions, producing green afterglow with a persistence time exceeding 600 s. This dual&#8208;mode excitation expands the operational versatility of afterglow materials. This approach demonstrates a promising strategy for integrating multiple optically active components into a single core&#8211;shell NP structure, offering tunable and extended afterglow performance for advanced optoelectronic and imaging applications.

         <title>Inner&#8208;Layer Indium Doping Achieved Highly Active and Stable Sulfur Vacancies in MoS2 for Superior Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium doping in the inner layer of MoS&#8322; is introduced to significantly reduce the high surface energy associated with sulfur vacancies, achieving highly active and stable catalysts for enhancing sulfur redox kinetics in high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The novel In&#8208;Vs catalytic sites effectively lower reaction&#8208;free energies and diffusion energy barriers, accelerate redox kinetics, ensure stable catalytic performance, and mitigate the shuttling effect.








Abstract
Defect engineering in MoS2 via sulfur vacancies (Vs&#8208;MoS2) has shown potential in enhancing lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (LSB) performance by mitigating the polysulfide shuttle effect. However, the high surface energy of Vs&#8208;MoS2 impedes long&#8208;term catalyst stability. Herein, indium (In) doping is introduced into the inner layer of Vs&#8208;MoS2 lattice (In&#8208;Vs&#8208;MoS2), which effectively stabilizes the catalyst by reducing surface energy and enhancing sulfur redox kinetics. Theoretical calculations confirm that In doping, in conjunction with surface vacancies, optimizes charge distribution and generates unpaired electrons near the Fermi level, thus improving polysulfide adsorption and lowering Li2S formation barriers. LSBs with In&#8208;Vs&#8208;MoS2 separators deliver stable cycling at 0.5 C with a favorable capacity of 1042&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 retained after 100 cycles. Moreover, even at high current density (5 C) and high S loading (8.7 mg cm&#8722;2) scenario, stable cycling is realized, demonstrating the strategy's effectiveness in advancing LSB electrocatalysis. This work offers a straightforward strategy for practical LSBs and deepens the understanding of vacancy&#8208;modulated electrocatalysts for sulfur redox.

         <title>Tunable Vacancy Order and Emergent Functionalities in Half&#8208;Heusler Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disorder in a crystal is rarely randomly distributed but instead can involve extra chemical order. This could offer a new degree of freedom that is essential to designing materials with emergent properties. This research achieves the continuous regulation of vacancy order from long&#8208;range order to short&#8208;range order in cation&#8208;deficient half&#8208;Heusler crystals. Engagingly, various functionalities present significant changes accompanying the evolution of vacancy order.









Abstract
Extra chemical order within periodic crystalline lattices offers&#160;a promising approach for designing materials with emergent functionalities. However, achieving tunable extra chemical order in crystalline materials remains challenging. Here, it is found that the vacancy order in cation&#8208;deficient half&#8208;Heusler crystals V1&#8208;

&#948;
CoSb can be tuned from long&#8208;range order (LRO) to short&#8208;range order (SRO), or vice versa. The vacancy LRO and SRO configurations are uncovered by scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, the evolution of vacancy order induces profound changes in electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties, as well as hydrogen storage characteristics. In particular, the electronic density of state effective mass exhibits a nearly threefold increase, while ferromagnetism emerges from infancy when tuning the vacancy order from LRO to SRO. These results elucidate the local chemical order&#8208;property relationship and highlight the great potential of achieving desirable functionalities by designing extra chemical order in crystalline solids.

         <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media via Ruthenium&#8211;Chromium Atomic Pairs Modified Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents RuNPs&#8208;RuCrAPs&#8208;N&#8208;C, a novel electrocatalyst incorporating Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs), single atoms, and Ru&#8211;Cr atomic pairs (RuCrAps) on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, exhibiting exceptional alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. RuCrAPs modify the electronic structure of RuNPs as active sites through the optimised electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) and enhanced water adsorption and dissociation.








Abstract
Precisely optimizing the electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) of the electrocatalysts and tuning the electronic structures of active sites are crucial for accelerating water adsorption and dissociation kinetics in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, an effective strategy is applied to modify the electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) by incorporating Ru single atoms (RuSAs) and Ru and Cr atomic pairs (RuCrAPs) onto a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (N&#8211;C) support through optimized EMSI. The resulting catalyst, RuNPs&#8208;RuCrAPs&#8208;N&#8208;C, shows exceptional performance for alkaline HER, achieving a six times higher turnover frequency (TOF) of 13.15 s&#8315;&#185; at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, compared to that of commercial Pt/C (2.07 s&#8315;&#185;). Additionally, the catalyst operates at a lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8315;2 (&#951;10 = 31&#160;mV), outperforming commercial Pt/C (&#951;10 = 34&#160;mV). Experimental results confirm that the RuCrAPs modified RuNPs are the main active sites for the alkaline HER, facilitating the rate&#8208;determining steps of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the Ru&#8211;Cr interaction also plays a vital role in modulating hydrogen desorption. This study presents a synergistic approach by rationally combining single atoms, atomic pairs, and nanoparticles with optimized EMSI effects to advance the development of efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.

         <title>Heteronanoarchitecture of Ti3C2Tx MXene and Amorphous MOF for Exceptional Durability in Electro&#8208;Ionic Soft Actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoscale hybridization of MXene and amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (MXene&#8211;aMOF) achieves exceptional electrochemical stability and ion storage capacity, attributed to the synergistic interplay between the nanoporous surfaces of aMOF and the metal&#8208;like electron conduction of MXene. This enhanced longevity of the MXene&#8208;aMOF electrode enables active morphing surfaces with reconfigurable dimensions and patterns, advancing applications in smart, adaptive materials.








Abstract
The assembly of 2D nanosheets with other functional nanomaterials enables the creation of materials with unique property combinations that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;phase materials. In particular, a combination of inorganic and organic components provides a pathway to structures offering highly durable ionic and electronic conductivity simultaneously. Here, a controlled growth of amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework (aMOF) in the interlayer spaces of Ti3C2Tx MXene for enhancing oxidation stability and accelerating fast ion transport is reported. The hydrophilic terminations of MXene provide support for the continuous growth of iron&#8208;based aMOF in the available interlayer 2D slits. Effective electronic interactions involving hydrogen bonding, coordination, and esterification in&#8208;between the open surfaces of MXene and nanoporous aMOF enhance the electrochemical strength of MXene&#8211;aMOF hybrid electrodes and allow the design of extremely durable electro&#8208;ionic soft actuators. The MXene&#8211;aMOF exhibits a fivefold increment in electroactuation compared to a conventional poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) soft actuator, with robust stability up to 50&#160;000 cycles in open air. Using the MXene&#8211;aMOF soft actuator, a deformable morphing surface with reversibly adjustable shapes and patterns is demonstrated.

         <title>Crystal Transformation Strategy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework solid&#8208;state electrolytes are developed for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The short&#8208;distance Zn2+ conduction pathways and abundant hydrogen bonds network achieved the rapid Zn2+ conduction, the Zn dendrite growth, and hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;inhibition, displaying long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating stability, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state battery with high capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great potential for sustainable and high&#8208;safety reserves. However, the advancement of solid&#8208;state ZIBs is constrained by the shortage of reasonable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) with abundant hopping sites, effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) inhibition, and favorable interfacial compatibility. Herein, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) CAM&#8208;Ag with Zn2+ hopping sites is developed as SSE for ZIBs. Taking advantage of the short&#8208;distance Zn2+ conduction pathways by crystal transformation through incorporating the Ag&#8722;N coordinate bonds, CAM&#8208;Ag SSE achieves a significant ionic conductivity of 1.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and superior Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. An abundant hydrogen bonds network effectively inhibits the initiation of HER and the subsequent generation of by&#8208;products. Moreover, the rapid Zn2+ conduction kinetics facilitated the inhibition of dendrite growth, promoting the uniform Zn2+ distribution. CAM&#8208;Ag SSE displays an extensive electrochemical stability range of 0&#8211;2.66&#160;V and remarkable electrochemical compatibility, enabling stable Zn2+ plating/stripping for &#8776;1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, CAM&#8208;Ag SSE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ZIBs achieve a specific capacity of 315&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with only 1.5% decrease in capacitance after 24&#160;h. The proposed HOF&#8208;based SSE displays a potential pathway for advancing stable and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state ZIBs.

         <title>De Novo Design of Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 Modulating Proteins to Enhance Biomaterial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NeoNectins are de novo&#8208;designed miniproteins that selectively bind and stabilize the extended open form of integrin &#945;5&#946;1. When grafted onto biomaterials including hydrogel and titanium, they promote cell attachment and spreading in vitro and promoting tissue integration and bone growth in animal models, demonstrating broad potential for regenerative medicine and biomaterials.








Abstract
Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 is crucial for cell attachment and migration in development and tissue regeneration, and &#945;5&#946;1 binding proteins can have considerable utility in regenerative medicine and next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We use computational protein design&#160;to create de novo &#945;5&#946;1&#8208;specific modulating miniprotein binders, called NeoNectins, that bind to and stabilize the open state of &#945;5&#946;1. When immobilized onto titanium surfaces and throughout 3D hydrogels, the NeoNectins outperform native fibronectin (FN) and RGD peptides in enhancing cell attachment and spreading, and NeoNectin&#8208;grafted titanium implants outperformed FN&#8208; and RGD&#8208;grafted implants in animal models in promoting tissue integration and bone growth. NeoNectins should be broadly applicable for tissue engineering and biomedicine.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Controlled Pre&#8208;SEI Regulation for Improved Lithium Reversibility in Anode&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;solid electrolyte interphase (pre&#8208;SEI) is designed by a potentiostatic controlling electrolyte decomposition method to reduce Li loss for SEI formation and smooth Li deposition/dissolution behavior, prolonging the cycling life of anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (AF&#8208;SSLMBs) with high safety and improved energy density receive increasing attention but are restricted by the low Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) that result from undesirable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and irreversible Li deposition/dissolution. Herein, a pre&#8208;SEI is designed by a potentiostatic controlling electrolyte decomposition method to reduce Li loss for SEI formation and smooth Li deposition/dissolution behavior. When holding the potential at 0.5&#160;V, the electrolyte additive ethoxy&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) and lithium salts simultaneously decompose to form a dense double&#8208;layered pre&#8208;SEI with high ionic conductivity, enabling fast Li+ transport across the interface and suppressing the following Li loss of building SEI. As a result, a high initial CE (ICE: 95.5%) and stable CE of 98.7% in Li|Cu cells are achieved, which is a 12.7% and 0.7% improvement compared with the&#160;counterpart without pre&#8208;SEI. Moreover, the cycling life of the assembled AF&#8208;SSLMB pouch cell (Cu||LFP) with pre&#8208;SEI is prolonged by 5 times, with a capacity retention rate of 44.9% after 100 cycles. This work provides a scalable strategy to reduce Li loss for both building SEI and following the Li plating/stripping process in AF&#8208;SSLMBs.

         <title>Design of a Tunable, High&#8208;performance Mixed Matrix Membrane Platform for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, flexible, tunable, and non&#8208;aging mixed matrix membrane platform is developed by incorporating CHA zeolites, featuring a 3D pore system with precise molecular&#8208;sieving and tunable chemical interactions, into a polyimide matrix at exceptionally high loadings. This tunable membrane platform significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes across a wide range of critical applications and can be beneficial for next&#8208;generation molecular separation membrane developments with vast industrial potential.








Abstract
Membrane technology offers substantial economic and environmental benefits for energy&#8208;intensive chemical separations. Chabazite&#8208;type zeolite, possessing a 3&#8208;D channel system with molecular&#8208;sieving windows, can be an ideal membrane material, but conditions to synthesize zeolite&#8208;only membranes limit optimization strategies. Guided by advanced quantum chemistry calculations on inner&#8208;pore molecular interactions, zeolite properties are tailored for different separations and optimized particles incorporated in polyimide at very high loadings. A membrane platform is thus created that largely outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for a broad variety of industry&#8208;relevant applications, that is, carbon capture, natural gas/biogas purification, hydrocarbon, helium and hydrogen recovery. Accurate size&#8208;sieving of gas molecules is realized together with rational determination of optimal gas&#8208;zeolite interactions. Crucial for industrial applications, these well&#8208;tuned membranes displayed excellent non&#8208;aging properties, high flexibility and higher mixed&#8208;gas selectivities than ideal&#8208;gas selectivities. Moreover, they performed even better at low CO2&#8208;partial pressure in CO2&#8208;removal and can be made humidity&#8208;insensitive.

         <title>Unlocking Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Performance with Porous PtCoV Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer microenvironment is strategically engineered to alleviate the sulfonate group&#8208;induced poisoning effect on Pt active sites by encapsulating Pt&#8208;based nanoalloys within porous nanofibers. This innovative architecture significantly enhanced proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance, achieving a remarkable peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an exceptional initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported Pt&#8208;based catalysts in fuel cells often suffer from sulfonate poisoning, reducing Pt utilization and activity. Herein, a straightforward strategy is developed for synthesizing a porous PtCoV nanoalloy embedded within the porous structures of carbon nanofibers. Incorporation of vanadium (V) atoms into the PtCo alloy optimizes the oxygen binding energy of Pt sites, while heightening the dissolution energy barrier for both Pt and Co atoms, leading to a significantly enhanced intrinsic activity and durability of the catalyst. By encapsulating the nanoalloys within porous nanofibers, a non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer interface is created to mitigate the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups to Pt sites, while promoting oxygen permeation and allowing proton transfer. This rational architecture liberates additional active Pt sites, while the evolved porous nanostructure of the PtCoV alloy extends its exposed surface area, thereby boosting Pt utilization within the catalytic layer and overall fuel cell performance. The optimized catalyst demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1, which exceeds&#160;the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. This study provides a promising avenue for developing highly active and durable low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.

         <title>Effect of Combination Model of MoTe2 and MXene Layers on Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, in which the (002) crystal plane of MoTe2 is perpendicular to the MXene layer, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) crystal plane parallel to MXene layer has a more stable interface structure and more sodium ion storage sites, thereby achieving excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The integration of different crystal planes between two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials results in various combinations, which always exert different effects on the electrochemical properties of materials. The metallic 1T&#8242; phase of molybdenum telluride is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but its rearrangement and restacking during charge/discharge process causes a decline in cycle. Herein, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) planes parallel to MXene layers and MX@MoTe2&#8208;V with MoTe2 (002) planes perpendicular to MXene layers are controllably constructed. Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, the new interface formed between MoTe2 and MXene in MX@MoTe2&#8208;P has a stronger van der Waals interaction and larger contact area, helpful to store more sodium ions and contributing to its excellent structural stability and battery capacity. Although MX@MoTe2&#8208;V has a higher sodium adsorption energy than MX@MoTe2&#8208;P, the small interface area lowers the storage capacity and it further aggravates the collapse of the structure. When used as the anode for SIBs, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P offers excellent cycle stability and specific capacity. In particular, sodium&#8208;ion full cell consisting of MX@MoTe2&#8208;P anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode shows the excellent performance (147.2 mAh g&#8722;1@1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) surpassing all the reported MoTe2&#8208;based materials. This work provides a guide for the manufacture of new electrode materials.

         <title>Engineering Bacterial Secretion Systems for Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Surgical Guidance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel contrast agent platform, Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS), for fluorescence image guided surgery. SAS selectively colonizes tumors and secretes streptavidin, enabling precise delineation of invasive tumor margins with prolonged signal retention. The platform demonstrates robust&#160;imaging performance across various tumor types, offering strong potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Current imaging techniques suffer from a lack of specificity and resolution, leading to inaccurate tumor imaging and limited applicability of targeted contrast agents, as they require cancer&#8208;specific development. The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface&#8208;stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image&#8208;guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin&#8208;conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR &#8764; 2), while enabling prolonged 3&#8208;day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer&#160;surgery.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Mechanochromic Responses from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomer Tubes of Uniform Sheath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural&#8208;colored tube is created from cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers, exhibiting uniform color changes with high strain sensitivity upon extension and inflation. The color change occurs across multiple mechanochromic modes, highlighting the influence of molecular anisotropy and tubular geometry on strain sensitivity. The tubes demonstrate reconfigurable alphabet displays and 3D photonic skins.









Abstract
Materials that exhibit varied optical responses to different modes of mechanical stimuli are attractive for complex sensing and adaptive functionalities. However, most mechanochromic materials are fabricated from films or fibers with limited actuation modes. Here, hollow tubes of a symmetric sheath are created using cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) at the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. The oligomeric precursor is sheared in an elastomeric microchannel to form uniform thickness, overcoming gravity effect and Plateau&#8208;Rayleigh instability. In addition, the coloration is achieved to be faster and have higher reflectivity compared to that of solid fibers. The tube can undergo axial, circumferential, and radial strains upon extension and inflation. The combination of molecular anisotropy and geometry of the tube enables highly sensitive mechanochromic responses in both azimuthal and axial directions: inflation causes red&#8208;to&#8208;violet shift (&#8776;220&#160;nm) at a circumferential strain of 0.57. The inflation of a bent tube generates another mechanochromic mode with a higher sensitivity to strain. Finally, display of 26 alphabets is achieved using 5 tubes, of which the positions can be reconfigured, and curvature&#8208;dependent 3D photonic skins are demonstrated from tubes wrapped around 3D objects. The multi&#8208;mode mechanochromic tubes will find applications for soft robotics, adaptive displays, wearable sensors, and spectrometers.

The authors fabricate a reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray, which can rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the OxyGel spray accelerates full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats.









Abstract
The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and poor oxygen supply are two prominent factors of the inflammatory microenvironment that delay diabetic wound healing. However, current clinical treatments cannot achieve effective ROS scavenging and sustained oxygenation. Herein, a ROS&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray that integrates a multifunctional nanozyme with a dynamically crosslinked sprayable hydrogel matrix is presented. The nanozyme, which is fabricated based on the ceria&#8208;zoledronic acid nanoparticles modified with tannic acid (TCZ nanozymes), can mimic the cascade catalytic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to effectively scavenge ROS while generating oxygen. These synergistic actions rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the nanozyme via the hydrogel spray stably deposits the nanozymes at the target sites to accelerate full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;seq results revealed the upregulation of multiple signaling pathways related to wound healing by the OxyGel spray, highlighting the potential of this platform not only for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds but also other diseases associated with oxidative stress and hypoxia.

         <title>Unveiling the Effects of Hydroxyl&#8208;Induced Trap States on the Charge Transport in p&#8208; and n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors through Variable&#8208;Temperature Characterization</title>

A full high vacuum preparation and characterization chain unveils that hydroxyl&#8208;induced trap states affect the charge transport in p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OFETs similarly. The variable&#8208;temperature TLM analysis suggests that the activation energy of charge transport plays a more significant role than the density of trap states. Furthermore, the injection barrier is significantly lower in devices with a hydroxyl&#8208;free dielectric.








Abstract
Trap states at the gate dielectric&#8208;organic semiconductor (OSC) interface are one of the main sources of extrinsic traps in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, they are often overlooked and their effects on the charge transport are attributed to the exposure of devices to ambient air. Here a first variable&#8208;temperature transfer length method characterization of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OFETs under full high vacuum conditions is reported. By comparing a hydroxylated aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gate dielectric with a hydroxyl&#8208;free, tetradecylphosphonic acid&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 dielectric, it is shown that hydroxyl&#8208;induced trap states reduce the charge carrier mobility in OFETs regardless of the channel type. This observation challenges the common belief that the hydroxyl&#8208;induced traps are affecting primarily the n&#8208;channel transport. The variable&#8208;temperature analysis yields a high activation energy of charge transport as the main effect of a hydroxylated gate dielectric. Moreover, the injection barrier at the interface between the source&#8208;drain electrodes and the OSC layer is significantly lower for devices with a hydroxyl&#8208;free dielectric and correlates with the activation energy of charge transport. This work identifies previously hidden limitations of charge transport in OFETs, opening opportunities for further improvements in device performance and potential device&#160;applications.

         <title>Adhesively Bridging Co&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer and Perovskite Via In Situ Polymerization for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembled monolayer with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. The polymerized layer at the interface enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
The strategic utilization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly advances the interfacial contact and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, inadequate adhesion between the SAM and perovskite layer remains a critical challenge, limiting further performance enhancement. Herein, a synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembly approach with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. Specifically, 11&#8208;Mercaptoundecylphosphoric acid (MPA) is incorporated into a SAM to form co&#8208;SAMs, improving homogeneity and mitigating defects at the NiOx surface. Simultaneously, the ionic liquid (IL) monomer 1&#8208;Allyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide (AVMTF2) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor. The aggregation of ILs cation at the bottom interface facilitates in situ polymerization via sulfhydryl end groups, forming the POL&#8208;AVM polymer at the perovskite/SAM interface. This polymer enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds. As a result, this synergistic strategy achieves a champion PCE of 26.25% (certified 26.04%), along with excellent long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95.6% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol.

Polymer regulation shapes a weakly solvating polymer&#8208;stabilized anion&#8208;rich Na+ solvation structure and robust dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase, enabling long&#8208;life and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free sodium battery with high energy.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) offer a promising solution to enhance the inherently low energy of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) while circumventing the challenges in processing highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, their practical viability is severely hindered by short lifespan, driven by accelerated irreversible Na loss in zero&#8208;Na&#8208;excess cell configurations, alongside safety concerns of liquid electrolyte leakage. Here, a design of long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state AFSMBs is demonstrated by leveraging polymer regulation of Na+ solvation behavior and anode interphase chemistry to reduce Na loss while enhancing cell safety. The polyoxymethylene with reduced local steric hindrance and weak Na+ chelation shapes a weakly solvating polymer&#8208;stabilized anion&#8208;rich Na+ solvation structure. It facilitates Na+ transport and formation of robust inorganic&#8211;organic dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), enabling smooth Na metal deposition in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. This chemistry yields quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state AFSMBs with a long lifespan of 500 cycles and 79% capacity retention at a high rate of 1 C. The 1.2 Ah pouch cells retain 81% capacity over 200 cycles, delivering a volumetric energy of 340&#160;Wh L&#8315;1, surpassing LiFePO4||graphite lithium&#8208;ion batteries, while achieving a comparable gravimetric energy of 190&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. Such cells also exhibit high reliability against nail penetration in the open air at a fully charged state.

         <dc:description>
Monodispersed Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single&#8208;atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst (Os&#8208;Co(OH)2). By leveraging d&#8208;p orbital hybridization, the adsorption energy of active sites is optimally tuned, endowing the catalyst with exceptional intrinsic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR).








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis (HzOR&#8208;SWE) is critical for addressing freshwater scarcity and energy crises.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrazine oxidation-assisted seawater electrolysis (HzOR-SWE) is critical for addressing freshwater scarcity and energy crises. However, the development of this technology has been significantly impeded by the absence of efficient catalysts capable of cleaving N&#9472;H bonds during the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, Monodispersed Os-O-Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single-atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst. The d-p orbital hybridization in the structure shifts the d-band center of Os sites away from the Fermi level, weakening the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and exhibiting the lowest N&#9472;H dehydrogenation energy barrier for HzOR and moderate active hydrogen adsorption energy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

This represents a 70.7% energy saving compared to conventional seawater splitting systems (2.62 V, 7.6 kWh mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Ionogels Reinforced by Ionophobic Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major advancement in gel technology is presented with the introduction of &#8220;Ionophobic Coordination Reinforcement.&#8221;(ICR). This strategy combines ionic liquid&#8208;phobic microphase separation with lithium&#8208;ion coordination crosslinking, enabling a novel thermoplastic gel network. ICR achieves remarkable mechanical performance, efficient self&#8208;healing at room&#8208;temperature, and exceptional melt&#8208;processability, overcoming key challenges in gel materials.








Abstract
As the key materials for next&#8208;generation wearable and flexible electronics, ionogels are expected to combine excellent mechanical performance, efficient room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing, and facile processability. Current ionogels typically face a significant trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and self&#8208;healing efficiency, limiting their practical applications. Here, &#8220;Ionophobic Coordination Reinforcement&#8221; (ICR) is introduced, a strategy that integrates ionic liquid&#8208;phobic microphase separation with lithium&#8208;ion coordination crosslinking. The ICR design yields a dual glass transition temperature (Tg): &#8722;60.27&#160;&#176;C for maintaining soft phase mobility and 55.33&#160;&#176;C for reinforcing hard phase strength. This architecture achieves simultaneous high mechanical performance (6.4&#8208;fold increase in tensile strength, 4&#8208;fold increase in toughness, and 35.6&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus) and efficient self&#8208;healing at ambient conditions. Furthermore, this dynamic supramolecular architecture also provides exceptional melt&#8208;processability, facilitating advanced fabrication techniques such as melt spinning. Taking advantage of the high specific surface area of ionogel fibers, the sensor exhibits enhanced humidity sensitivity and rapid response to respiratory moisture changes compared to film counterparts. Integrated into a wireless platform, it enables real&#8208;time, non&#8208;invasive respiratory monitoring, while intrinsic self&#8208;healing ensures long&#8208;term stability. ICR effectively resolves the trade&#8208;off between strength and self&#8208;healing, offering a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.

         <title>C15&#8208;Phase Platinum&#8208;Lanthanide Intermetallics for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution: Identifying Lanthanide's Enhanced Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;supported Pt2Ln intermetallics are efficiently and rapidly synthesized using Joule heating technology, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is demonstrated that the Ln sites, due to the high oxophilicity and strong orbital hybridization, play a key role in enhancing HER performance by regulating both the adsorption/dissociation of H2O and the desorption of H* intermediates.









Abstract
Platinum&#8208;Lanthanide (Pt&#8208;Ln) intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are a promising new class of electrocatalytic materials, yet their synthesis remains a significant challenge, and the role of ordered Ln sites in enhancing catalytic performance is not fully understood. Herein, an effective and rapid avenue for synthesizing carbon&#8208;supported C15&#8208;phase Pt2Ln IMCs (Ln: Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb) through Joule heating technology is proposed. The JH&#8208;Pt2Ln/C IMCs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which JH&#8208;Pt2Tb/C presents the lowest overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The ordered Pt2Tb structure offers favorable Pt2 dimer sites for the desorption of H* intermediates, in contrast to the Pt3 trimer sites in disordered Pt2Tb and pure Pt. The ordered Tb sites play a bifunctional role in HER: i) The oxophilic Tb atoms are in favor of the H2O adsorption and dissociation through Tb&#8208;4f&#8208;OH binding; ii) The strong Tb 4f&#8208;Pt 5d orbital hybridization leads to form negatively charged Pt sites, which promotes the desorption of H* intermediates. Furthermore, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer equipped with JH&#8208;Pt2Tb/C delivers a low voltage of only 1.79 Vcell to reach 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stable operation at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for over 100&#160;h.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Hollow Fiber Membranes for Efficient, Selective, and Scalable Mercury Ion Removal from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured sulfurized polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber membranes are fabricated via wet spinning for efficient and selective mercury ion removal. The membranes demonstrate excellent adsorption performance and exceptional reusability, maintaining over 99% efficiency after multiple regeneration cycles. Integrated into a scalable purification device, they provide a robust and sustainable solution for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation in water systems.









Abstract
Mercury ions (Hg2+) pose serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health due to their high toxicity and bioaccumulation. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) nanoparticles, which contain soft Lewis base groups interact strongly with the soft Lewis acid Hg2+, demonstrating excellent adsorption performance and chemical stability. However, traditional methods typically involve dispersing SPAN nanoparticles in water or coating them on substrates, leading to uneven distribution, poor material stability, and potential secondary pollution. To overcome challenges in mercury removal, this study presents a highly selective, regenerable, and structurally stable SPAN&#8208;integrated hollow fiber membrane fabricated by wet spinning. The hierarchical structure significantly improves pore architecture, adsorption capacity, and long&#8208;term stability. The membrane achieves an initial Hg2+ removal efficiency of 98.31% and retains &#8776;99.7% efficiency after five regeneration cycles. When integrated into a scalable purification device, it removes 90.94% of Hg2+ from water with an initial Hg2+ concentration of 4.69 mg L&#8722;1. This work offers a novel, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation.

         <title>Exceptional Oxidation Resistance of High&#8208;Entropy Carbides up to 3600&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C high&#8208;entropy carbides with exceptional oxidation resistance of 2.7 &#181;m&#183;s&#8722;1 up to 3600&#160;&#176;C are successfully explored through a high&#8208;entropy compositional engineering strategy. The exceptional oxidation resistance primarily results from the formation of unique dual&#8208;structural oxide layers that involve numerous high&#8208;melting&#8208;point W particles uniformly embedded within the molten (Hf, Me)6(Ta, Me)2O17 major phase.








Abstract
Achieving exceptional oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures is long desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;temperature materials to be used in relevant applications such as hypersonic flights, re&#8208;entry vehicles, and propulsion systems.

&lt;p&gt;(Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C high-entropy carbides with exceptional oxidation resistance of 2.7 &#181;m&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; up to 3600&#160;&#176;C are successfully explored through a high-entropy compositional engineering strategy. The exceptional oxidation resistance primarily results from the formation of unique dual-structural oxide layers that involve numerous high-melting-point W particles uniformly embedded within the molten (Hf, Me)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Ta, Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; major phase.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving exceptional oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures is long desirable for ultrahigh-temperature materials to be used in relevant applications such as hypersonic flights, re-entry vehicles, and propulsion systems. However, their practical service temperatures are typically limited to below 3000&#160;&#176;C. Here, the exploration of (Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C high-entropy carbides with exceptional oxidation resistance of 2.7 &#181;m&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; up to 3600&#160;&#176;C through a high-entropy compositional engineering strategy is reported. This impressive oxidation behavior arises from the formation of unique dual-structural oxide layers involving numerous high-melting-point W particles uniformly embedded within molten (Hf, Me)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Ta, Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; (Me = metal element, Hf, Ta, Zr, and W) primary oxides. The developed (Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C demonstrates a significant breakthrough for ultrahigh-temperature applications up to 3600&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for further design of advanced ultrahigh-temperature materials capable of serving at higher service temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via the Synergy of Linker Engineering and Machine Learning for Efficient and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This study proposes a ligand&#8208;engineering strategy to construct a series of functionalized X&#8208;MIL(V)&#8208;47 framework materials, enabling a systematic elucidation of the synergistic mechanisms between surface functionalization and morphological features in enhancing the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By integrating machine learning with advanced characterization techniques, the zinc&#8208;storage mechanism and the structural evolution during cycling are comprehensively revealed.








Abstract
Precise regulation of ligands in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to modulate the local electronic structure and charge distribution has become an effective strategy for optimizing their electrochemical performance. However, utilizing ligand&#8208;functionalized MOFs to activate their potential in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge. Herein, eight ligand&#8208;functionalized X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 (X represents the functional groups) samples are prepared using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The polar substituents on the ligand regulated the electronic structure of the MOFs through inductive and conjugative effects, altering the electron density of the metal center and thereby facilitating the optimization of the Zn2+ insertion/extraction kinetics. The coordination environment of X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 is analyzed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and the Zn2+ storage mechanism is thoroughly investigated through both in situ/ex situ spectroscopic techniques. The experimental results are consistent with DFT calculations, indicating that the introduction of polar substituents induces charge redistribution within the MOFs, thereby enhancing the reversibility of the redox reaction. Furthermore, a machine learning model based on the orthogonal expansion method and experimental data is developed to predict electrode material performance under varying conditions. This study provides new insights into the design of functional MOFs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Covalent Organic Frameworks via Phosphonate Ylide&#8208;Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, the high electron density at aromatic carbon in COFs generates inert oxygen evolution, significantly hindering photocatalytic activity. Developing phosphonate ylide&#8208;sites in COFs enables polaron&#8208;enhanced charge separation and low oxygen evolution barriers, achieving a 62&#8208;fold increase in H2/O2 production over pristine COFs and enabling scalable outdoor hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting to hydrogen generation. However, the high electron density distribution at aromatic carbon in COFs results in inert oxygen evolution, significantly hindering photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Here, a universal strategy is developed for localized electron density manipulation by utilizing the reactivity of unsaturated carbon at the linkers in the COFs to construct phosphonate ylide polar sites, featuring positively charged phosphorus and negatively charged carbon. Under photoexcitation, this local electron distribution generates a polaron effect, enhances photogenerated exciton dissociation, prevents radiative relaxation, accelerates photogenerated charge separation, and induces an extremely low oxygen evolution barrier at the phosphorus sites. The results show the phosphonate ylide COF has achieved H2 and O2 evolution rates of 24.7 and 12.0&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, with the 62 times increase over the pristine COF. Furthermore, this strategy has been successfully validated in several other COFs, demonstrating its broad applicability. To further validate its practical utility, a large&#8208;scale outdoor device of 4&#160;m2 using this catalyst is fabricated, which achieved a hydrogen production rate exceeding 300&#160;mmol&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its excellent potential for practical applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnetoresistance effect termed spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) is demonstrated in (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers. The SSMR is underpinned by the spin&#8211;charge interconversion process induced by the nonrelativistic spin&#8208;splitting effect in altermagnets. Utilizing the SSMR, a [001]&#8208;oriented N&#233;el vector in an epitaxial thin film of RuO2 is revealed, which evidences its altermagnetism.








Abstract
The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting&#8208;edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest&#8208;discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here, this controversy is attempted to be resolved by demonstrating a spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase&#8208;shift feature underpinned by the N&#233;el&#8208;vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers, a sizable SSMR is disentangled and hence a N&#233;el vector along [001] direction is unveiled. This work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue for probing the N&#233;el vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long&#8208;range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.

         <title>Multifunctional Interfacial Molecular Bridging Strategy Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy is proposed, for the first time, to address the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs by stabilizing the upper interface between perovskites and PCBM electron transport layer (ETL), passivating interfacial defects, and improving the energy band alignment.








Abstract
Interface engineering in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) faces critical challenges arising from nonideal interfacial contact, defect accumulation, impeded carrier transport, and energy&#8208;level misalignment between the perovskite and electron transport layer, for example, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). These interfacial deficiencies collectively induce nonradiative recombination and degrade device stability. Herein, a multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy using (benzhydrylthio)acetic acid (DSA) addresses the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs, achieving three synergistic roles. 1) Interfacial stabilization. A stable molecular&#8208;bridging layer is constructed with DSA at the perovskite/PCBM interface through carboxylate&#8211;Pb2&#8314; coordination bonds, along with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between DSA and PCBM. 2) Defect passivation. Multiple active sites in DSA molecules, such as thioether and carboxylic acid groups, can synchronously achieve chemical passivation with undercoordinated Pb2+ sites. 3) Energy band alignment: DSA induces n&#8208;type band bending through electron donation by the thioether, reducing the work function and enhancing the electron&#8208;extraction kinetics. As a result, DSA&#8208;treated devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.08% along with an open&#8208;circuit voltage loss of only 53&#160;mV. Finally, the DSA&#8208;treated devices demonstrate remarkable operational stability, retaining 96% of the initial efficiency after being tracked at the maximum power point for 2000&#160;h.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy is proposed, for the first time, to address the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs by stabilizing the upper interface between perovskites and PCBM electron transport layer (ETL), passivating interfacial defects, and improving the energy band alignment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interface engineering in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) faces critical challenges arising from nonideal interfacial contact, defect accumulation, impeded carrier transport, and energy-level misalignment between the perovskite and electron transport layer, for example, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). These interfacial deficiencies collectively induce nonradiative recombination and degrade device stability. Herein, a multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy using (benzhydrylthio)acetic acid (DSA) addresses the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs, achieving three synergistic roles. 1) &lt;i&gt;Interfacial stabilization&lt;/i&gt;. A stable molecular-bridging layer is constructed with DSA at the perovskite/PCBM interface through carboxylate&#8211;Pb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; coordination bonds, along with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between DSA and PCBM. 2) &lt;i&gt;Defect passivation&lt;/i&gt;. Multiple active sites in DSA molecules, such as thioether and carboxylic acid groups, can synchronously achieve chemical passivation with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites. 3) &lt;i&gt;Energy band alignment&lt;/i&gt;: DSA induces n-type band bending through electron donation by the thioether, reducing the work function and enhancing the electron-extraction kinetics. As a result, DSA-treated devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.08% along with an open-circuit voltage loss of only 53&#160;mV. Finally, the DSA-treated devices demonstrate remarkable operational stability, retaining 96% of the initial efficiency after being tracked at the maximum power point for 2000&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Goldilocks Paradox of Bioelectronics: Misreporting Piezoresistive Gauge Factor Is Obstructing Research Advancements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 34, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The misreporting of piezoresistive gauge factor for bioelectronic devices impacts the ability of researchers to assess the status of the field. Like Goldilocks, researchers need the ability to take similar bowls of porridge, or devices, and perform &#8220;taste&#8221; tests. A systematic analysis of published data outlines reporting and performance standards that must be adhered to by editors and researchers alike.








Abstract
In the fable Goldilocks and The Three Bears, Goldilocks discerns between seemingly similar bowls of porridge using temperature. In the field of wearable bioelectronics, researchers do not have the same luxury of simple comparative analysis. Devices based on composite materials applying electrically conductive nanomaterial and polymer networks present a technology path towards an Internet of Things driven healthcare system. However, research progress has been obstructed by a lack of consistency with regards to the industry standard performance metric, the gauge factor (G). Paradoxically, studies cannot be compared, as no one study measures G the same. However, extrapolating the correct value for G, its intrinsic relationship between the signal linearity figure of merit outlines fieldwide performance limitations for devices, new metrics and materials selection criteria.

Redefining Surface Chemistry
Oleylammonium halides, traditionally viewed as surface passivation agents, are revealed here as powerful inducers of structural transformation in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals. Leveraging this insight, Tze Chien Sum and coworkers introduce in article number 2500349 a simple, low&#8208;cost in situ core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize monodisperse, water&#8208;dispersible perovskite nanocrystals. These nanocrystals exhibit unprecedented single&#8208;photon emission in aqueous environments, opening new avenues for underwater quantum light sources.

Adaptive Cation&#8208;Selective Interfaces
An adaptive integrated interface structure has been developed, which couples time&#8208;dependent solvent evaporation with the spatial sedimentation of the transduction material. This structure utilizes lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as a component of the ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM), which seamlessly connects a meticulously uniform ISM on the top with the transduction layer below, achieving the highly stable detection of general cations. More details can be found in article number 2501749 by Zong&#8208;Yin Song, Meng Yang, Pei&#8208;Hua Li, Xing&#8208;Jiu Huang, and co&#8208;workers.

Hollow Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactors
In article number 2502977, Jian Liu, Sheng Ye, and co&#8208;authors report a hollow core&#8208;shell structured 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor, which features a metallic 1T&#8208;MoS2 shell encapsulating a semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2 core. This structure forms a Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction that drives dynamic charge redistribution, while surface&#8208;anchored Sn single atoms within Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motifs accelerate catalytic kinetics.

Nanosheets for Multifunctional Energy Applications
In article number 2505700, Ben Xu, Daofeng Sun, and co&#8208;workers present a scalable strategy for synthesizing 2D ultrathin MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets using Ni/Co&#8208;BDC frameworks with GO as a structure&#8208;directing agent. In a single batch, 1 kg of MGM nanosheets is obtained with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield. The universality of this method is demonstrated across multiple ligands. The resulting MGM7 nanosheets exhibit outstanding electrochemical and catalytic performance in basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution.

         <title>Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol and Aldehyde Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights and Economic Feasibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the synergistic integration of hydrogen evolution reactions with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions is explored to enhance H2 production efficiency. It examines reaction mechanisms, catalytic pathways, and energy advantages over conventional water splitting. Additionally, it evaluates technoeconomic feasibility, highlighting industrial scalability and the potential for value&#8208;added chemical generation, supporting the transition to sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic H2 generation via conventional water splitting is gaining attention, but challenges such as high overpotentials, energy demands, and slow kinetics limit its scalability. Here, a novel approach: coupling hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions (AAORs) is explored. This strategy decreases energy requirements, improves HER efficiency, and enables dual H2 generation. Additionally, it facilitates the cogeneration of valuable chemicals such as formate, acetate, and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), enhancing economic feasibility. A detailed analysis of alcohol and aldehyde oxidation mechanisms and their integration into electrocatalytic systems are provided here. Furthermore, it examines the technoeconomic advantages of HER coupled with AAORs, emphasizing cost efficiency and industrial scalability. It is aimed here to advance renewable energy technologies and optimize processes for large&#8208;scale H2 generation, contributing to a sustainable energy future by addressing these aspects.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on building better aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, including the electrochemistry of conventional and decoupled aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, the challenges for the sulfur cathode, zinc anode, and corresponding electrolytes, and the available strategies for the batteries. It will provide guidelines for the modification of electrodes, along with the selection of zinc salts, additives, and co&#8208;solvents.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries (AZSBs), including conventional and decoupled AZSBs, are suitable options for advanced electrochemical energy storage systems. They are cost&#8208;effective with safety, high theoretical capacity, and power density. Nevertheless, many inherent hurdles need to be overcome to make AZSBs practically feasible, including irreversible transformation of the sulfur cathode, instability of the Zn anode, and incompatibility of the electrolyte. This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of AZSBs, emphasizing the configurations and electrode reactions, challenges, strategies, and prospects for the future. First, the electrochemistry behavior of AZSBs is reviewed, encompassing both conventional and decoupled battery configurations, along with their respective electrode reactions. Second, various sources, hosts, and additives for sulfur are identified that can effectively enhance the reversibility of the sulfur cathode. Third, approaches to constructing the solid electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode and facilitating Zn alloying are discussed as key strategies for anode protection. Fourth, the selection of zinc salts and the employment of organic co&#8208;solvents are explored to regulate electrolytes. Finally, the thoughts on future research development in AZSBs are presented to build better aqueous batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biosensors are highly sensitive, portable, and versatile. Advanced nanomaterials enhance their performance, while machine learning (ML) improves data analysis, minimizes interference, and optimizes sensor design. Despite progress in both fields, their combined potential in diagnostics remains underexplored. This review highlights ML applications in electrochemical biosensors, showcasing their transformative impact on diagnostics and screening.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors offer numerous advantages, including high sensitivity, specificity, portability, ease of use, rapid response times, versatility, and multiplexing capability. Advanced materials and nanomaterials enhance electrochemical biosensors by improving sensitivity, response, and portability. Machine learning (ML) integration with electrochemical biosensors is also gaining traction, being particularly promising for addressing challenges such as electrode fouling, interference from non&#8208;target analytes, variability in testing conditions, and inconsistencies across samples. ML enhances data processing and analysis efficiency, generating actionable results with minimal information loss. Additionally, ML is well&#8208;suited for handling large, noisy datasets often generated in continuous monitoring applications. Beyond data analysis, ML can also help optimize biosensor design and function. While extensive research has expanded applications of advanced and nanomaterials&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors and ML in their respective fields, fewer studies explore their combined potential in diagnostics; their synergy holds immense promise for advancing diagnostics and screening. This review highlights recent ML applications in advanced and nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensing, categorized into biocatalytic sensing, affinity&#8208;based sensing, bioreceptor&#8208;free sensing, electrochemiluminescence, high&#8208;throughput sensing, and continuous monitoring. Together, these developments underscore the transformative potential of ML&#8208;aided advanced/nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors in diagnostics and screening, paving new pathways in the field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in piezoelectric materials for regenerative medicine, emphasizing their ability to convert mechanical stimuli into bioelectric signals that promote tissue repair. Key discussions cover the intrinsic piezoelectric properties of biological tissues, co&#8208;stimulation cellular mechanisms for tissue regeneration, and optimized structural designs aligned with specific tissue demands for translational applications.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, capable of converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, have emerged as promising tools in regenerative medicine due to their potential to stimulate tissue repair. Despite a surge in research on piezoelectric biomaterials, systematic insights to direct their translational optimization remain limited. This review addresses the current landscape by bridging fundamental principles with clinical potential. The biomimetic basis of piezoelectricity, key molecular pathways involved in the synergy between mechanical and electrical stimulation for enhanced tissue regeneration, and critical considerations for material optimization, structural design, and biosafety is discussed. More importantly, the current status and translational quagmire of mechanisms and applications in recent years are explored. A mechanism&#8208;driven strategy is proposed for the therapeutic application of piezoelectric biomaterials for tissue repair and identify future directions for accelerated clinical applications.

         <title>Single&#8211;Atom Supported Catalysts and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to traditional supports, single&#8211;atom catalyst supports possess abundant unsaturated coordination sites and diverse electronic states. They are used to accommodate active metal species, thereby modulating the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and influencing catalytic performance. The enhancement mechanisms due to site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interactions in single&#8211;atom supported catalysts can be categorized into two types: electronic interaction and synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Tuning electronic configurations of active components in supported metal catalysts can be achieved via strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between loaded metal species and support, which has a profound effect on catalytic efficiency. Distinct from conventional supports, single&#8211;atom catalysts, due to their rich unsaturated coordination metal sites and versatile electronic states, are employed as supports to load active metal species, which can manipulate the SMSI and thereby regulate catalytic performance. Although single&#8211;atom supported catalysts have demonstrated remarkable advance in catalytic capabilities, this field is still in its infancy with a large room for improvement. Here, definition, classification, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts are summarily demonstrated. The enhancement mechanisms influenced by site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interaction within single&#8211;atom supported catalysts including electronic interactions and synergistic catalysis are highlighted to present their potentials and advantages for catalysis community. Moreover, various single&#8211;atom supported catalysts with advanced components are summarized to discuss the relationships between components and catalytic properties. Finally, challenges and perspectives of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts for directions of future development are provided.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell Designs for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Electrolysis: Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent innovations in electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction cell designs. The latest advancements in in situ cells for operando characterization are also presented. Optimizations in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, electrolyte engineering, and counter&#8208;anodic reactions provide valuable insights into upgrading catalytic systems with enhanced energy efficiency, aiming to support the industrial&#8208;scale implementation of eCO2RR and water electrolysis.








Abstract
Integrating renewable electricity and concentrated CO2 from direct air capture, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) offer a promising pathway for converting CO2 into fuel chemicals, enabling the closure of the carbon loop in a sustainable manner. The clean H2 produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis can replace traditional fossil fuels without additional CO2 emissions. Achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;efficiency eCO2RR and HER requires the development of rational electrolyzer designs, which are crucial for industrial implementation. This review examines recent innovations in system designs for eCO2RR, HER, and the latest advances in in situ cell designs for operando characterization during electrochemical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;This review discusses recent innovations in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reactions (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction cell designs. The latest advancements in in situ cells for operando characterization are also presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating renewable electricity and concentrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from direct air capture, electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reactions (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) offer a promising pathway for converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into fuel chemicals, enabling the closure of the carbon loop in a sustainable manner. The clean H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis can replace traditional fossil fuels without additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Achieving large-scale and high-efficiency eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and HER requires the development of rational electrolyzer designs, which are crucial for industrial implementation. This review examines recent innovations in system designs for eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, HER, and the latest advances in in situ cell designs for operando characterization during electrochemical reactions. It focuses on cell improvements in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, and electrolyte engineering to maximize catalytic activities at the industrial level.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Preservation of Live Tumor Explants for Drug Development in Peritoneal Metastases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hyaluronan&#8208;based hydrogel&#160;platform preserving the native tumor microenvironment (morphology, tissue composition, histology) of patient&#8208;derived explants from peritoneal metastases, enabling clinically relevant drug screening. Hydrogel properties such as stiffness and degradation are crucial for longer&#8208;term histoculture. This study also reveals for the first time, a universal finding that hydrogels perturb myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction in embedded tissues, thereby enhancing explant preservation.








Abstract
Clinically effective treatments for peritoneal metastases (PM) remain a significant unmet need. To expedite drug development in PM, hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel&#8208;supported PM patient&#8208;derived tumor explants (PDTE) that better preserve histological features, composition, and biological pathways of the original tumor, as compared to conventional PDTE culture methods are developed. Hydrogel modulation shows that stiffness, degradation, three&#8208;dimensional embedding, and HA itself are key parameters that enhance PDTE maintenance ex vivo. Further, HA hydrogels effectively preserve PDTE viability by disrupting myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction, a phenomenon that occurs in the absence of hydrogel embedding. Lastly, the addition of ascites into PM PDTE not only recapitulates changes to the tumor microenvironment as observed in patients but also ascites&#8208;dependent drug efficacy, highlighting the importance of incorporating ascites into ex vivo PM models for accurate therapeutic evaluation. The bioengineered PM PDTE models in this study serve as a valuable platform for drug development and treatment personalization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replenishable Metabolically Augmented Synbiotic Microspheres Remodel Gut&#8208;Bone Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis, by employing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. Oral administration of SMASMs improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss in ovariectomized mice, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions.








Abstract
Gut microbiota dysbiosis in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is frequently accompanied by aberrant metabolism and absorption of short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, current oral probiotic therapies neglect the crucial role of probiotic&#8208;driven SCFAs metabolism in restoring gut&#8208;bone homeostasis. In this study, commencing with the sequencing of fecal samples from clinical patients with PMO, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via a thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid (HA) as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. In vitro, the SMASMs exhibit favorable biocompatibility, enhanced resistance to gastric acid, and improved mucosal adhesion for colonization. In vivo, oral administration of SMASMs in ovariectomized mice improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions. Notably, HA serves as a sustainable prebiotic substrate that supports the LGG metabolic niche and microbial homeostasis, enhances the production of SCFAs, including butyric, isobutyric, and valeric acids, and contributes to the downregulation of key osteoclastic signaling factors. Importantly, this strategy of oral SMASMs through in situ fermentation offers novel insights into addressing metabolic disorders associated with gut microbiota via the gut&#8211;X axis.

         <title>Controlling Lithium Surface Diffusivity via 2D PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2 Coatings for Anode&#8208;Free and Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium plating mechanisms on 2D&#8208;coated current collectors: PtTe2 coating enables rapid Li surface diffusivity, while PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings shorten diffusion paths for Li adatoms. In addition, Li2Te, formed from PdTe2 and NiTe2 decomposition, reduces the critical nucleus size by lowering the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and deposited Li.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;ion batteries (AFLBs) and Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) offer superior energy densities compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with graphite anodes. However, they degrade faster owing to their lower Coulombic efficiency, primarily caused by uneven Li deposition on the current collector (CC) in AFLBs or the Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) in LMBs. Coating CCs and LMAs has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the CE. Coating CCs and LMAs with PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2&#8212;metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides&#8212;reveals the critical factors for achieving uniform Li plating. The PtTe2 coating facilitates rapid Li surface diffusivity, while the PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings provide shorter diffusion paths for Li adatoms on the CCs and LMAs. In addition, Li2Te, formed as a byproduct of the decomposition of PdTe2 and NiTe2 during Li plating, reduces the critical nucleus size by minimizing the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and the plated Li. PtTe2 more effectively enhances the AFLB cycling performance, whereas PdTe2 and NiTe2 are more advantageous for LMBs. Notably, a 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick PdTe2 coating on the LMA achieves 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles using a LiFePO4 cathode (3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a 0.5 C&#8208;rate.

         <title>Siliconizing&#8208;Driven Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of 2D Tellurides with Controlled Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the strategy for preparing large&#8208;area 2D zirconium tellurides through a siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth process. The use of Si&#8208;Te precursor in this strategy, instead of conventional Te source, enhances the growth controllability of 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 single crystals such as layer thickness and crystallinity. The findings facilitate wafer&#8208;scale 2D tellurides for spintronic applications.








Abstract
2D transition metal tellurides (TMTs) possess fascinating properties for applications in ferroelectrics and optoelectronics. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to grow high&#8208;quality 2D TMTs with the desired phase (especially high&#8208;temperature phase) because of the weak bonding between the transition metal and Te as compared to S and Se atoms. Here, a strategy of siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is reported to synthesize 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 crystals with high crystallinity and desired thickness. Both as&#8208;synthesized crystals exhibit large&#8208;area uniform phases and atomically precise layered stacking structures. 2D ZrTe2 shows type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal characteristics with negative magnetoresistance, and 2D ZrTe3 demonstrates the existence of charge density waves and intrinsic superconductivity. Theoretical study reveals that silicon atoms can infiltrate and isolate a single layer of zirconium atoms and allow them to be tellurized in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner. The work paves the way for the synthesis of layer&#8208;controlled 2D TMTs and lays a material foundation for their physical property research.

The use of Si-Te precursor in this strategy, instead of conventional Te source, enhances the growth controllability of 2D ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals such as layer thickness and crystallinity. The findings facilitate wafer-scale 2D tellurides for spintronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal tellurides (TMTs) possess fascinating properties for applications in ferroelectrics and optoelectronics. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to grow high-quality 2D TMTs with the desired phase (especially high-temperature phase) because of the weak bonding between the transition metal and Te as compared to S and Se atoms. Here, a strategy of siliconizing-driven layer-by-layer growth is reported to synthesize 2D ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with high crystallinity and desired thickness. Both as-synthesized crystals exhibit large-area uniform phases and atomically precise layered stacking structures. 2D ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows type-II Weyl semimetal characteristics with negative magnetoresistance, and 2D ZrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates the existence of charge density waves and intrinsic superconductivity. Theoretical study reveals that silicon atoms can infiltrate and isolate a single layer of zirconium atoms and allow them to be tellurized in a layer-by-layer manner. The work paves the way for the synthesis of layer-controlled 2D TMTs and lays a material foundation for their physical property research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalized Adaptive Cation&#8208;Selective Interfaces Exhibiting High Stability: Integrating Transduction Materials and Uniform Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes via One&#8208;Step Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive integrated interface structure coupling time&#8208;dependent solvent evaporation and spatial sedimentation of transduction material is customized using lipophilic molybdenum disulfide as ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM) components, featuring a uniform ISM on top and transduction layers below. The interfacial mixed capacitance stability mechanism, driven by TFPB&#8722; surface adsorption, enhances the stability of general cation&#8208;selective electrodes and offers insights for sensing chip development.








Abstract
Rapidly advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;selective electrodes are promising candidates as key components in intelligent biological and chemical sensors. Ionics sensing performance, essential for sensor stability and reliability, is influenced not only by interface compositions but by often&#8208;overlooked overall interface structures. This work develops a one&#8208;step adaptive integrated interface structure (AIIS) with high interfacial stability for analyzing general cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+), showcasing exceptional near&#8208;Nernst response across wide linear ranges. AIIS, based on cetyltrimethylammonium&#8208;regulated lipophilic molybdenum disulfide (2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2), forms single&#8208;piece ISM on top and bottom transduction layers over time due to THF volatilization in ISM solutions, ensuring performance adaptability. A kinetic model developed through electrochemical numerical simulation confirms the optimal theoretical stability of an AIIS based on maximum transduction layer charge current and minimal diffusion current. The mixed capacitive transduction mechanism driven by the adsorption of TFPB&#8722; on the 2.0 CTA&#8208;MoS2 surface is elucidated. Adaptive integrated cadmium ion&#8208;selective electrodes, as a case study, exhibit excellent interfacial stability (potential drift of 5.51 &#177; 0.32 &#181;V&#160;h&#8722;1 for 24&#160;h and sensitivity loss rate of 4.77% for 30 days) and selectivity. This study proposes a promising strategy for constructing extendable interface structures, providing valuable insights for advancing sensor chip development.

         <title>De Novo Design of Efficient NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Activated Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer for Anti&#8208;Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;I&amp;II activated photosensitizers (PSs) based on boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives are synthesized via a de novo design strategy. Upon 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation, CTU3 NPs show highly efficient 7.8&#8208;fold enhancement in type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is higher than the reported type&#8208;I PS, resulting in irreversible cytotoxicity to tumor tissue and distinct solid tumor ablation and triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) within tumors.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) are considered to be efficient agents for overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to design type&#8208;I PSs that can be activated by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) irradiation. Herein, a series of organic heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free molecules are designed (named as CTU1, CTU2, and CTU3) and exhibit strong absorption bands over the first near&#8208;infrared and NIR&#8208;II regions. Among them, water&#8208;dispersible CTU3 nanoparticles (NPs) show strong J&#8208;aggregate characteristics and a good NIR&#8208;II absorption band, resulting in highly efficient &#8226;O2&#8722; generation upon irradiation of 1064&#160;nm light. In addition, the CTU3 NPs also exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 88.6%. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that CTU3 NPs have superior PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) effects, which can further induce immunogenic cell death and activate immune cells in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice for combined PDT/PTT anti&#8208;tumor photoimmunotherapy against refractory tumors. This work presents a paradigm of de novo design of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated type&#8208;I PS for combinational photoimmunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>2D, Physical&#8208;Vapor Growth of Low&#8208;Coercivity, Epitaxial Ferroelectric Sc0.3Al0.7N on Scalable Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically smooth, ultrathin Sc0.3Al0.7N ferroelectric films are synthesized on scalable substrates via 2D pulsed laser deposition. The films exhibit significantly reduced coercive fields, exceptional crystallinity, and robust endurance. Density functional theory and cross&#8208;sectional microscopy reveal the role of abrupt interfaces in minimizing switching barriers, offering new insights into energy&#8208;efficient ferroelectric device platforms.








Abstract
Ferroelectric nitrides attract immense attention due to their excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties as well as for their compatibility with scalable semiconductor technology. The availability of high&#8208;quality nitride films possessing tailorable coercive voltage and field, however, remains challenging, and is a key for deeper exploration of switching dynamics and practical applications in low&#8208;power devices. 2D growth of epitaxial thin (&#8818;20&#160;nm) c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Sc0.3Al0.7N films is reported on Al2O3 (0001) and on electrically conductive 4H&#8208;SiC (0001), obtained by reflection high&#8208;energy electron diffraction&#8208;monitored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer physical vapor deposition growth. Films exhibit high quality, as evidenced by rocking curve full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) as narrow as &#8776;0.02&#176;, and an atomically abrupt film&#8208;substrate interface with low dislocation density. The coercive field of Sc0.3Al0.7N/4H&#8208;SiC (0001) heterostructures is as low as 2.75 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, a high endurance of &gt;109 cycles at saturation polarization is achieved. Density functional theory calculations of a model system reveal that an improved crystal quality, including atomically abrupt ferroelectric nitride&#8208;metal interface, facilitates the reduction in the switching barriers, and leads to reduced coercivity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining high&#8208;quality epitaxial ferroelectric nitride films on highly scalable and radiation&#8208;resistant substrates, and their potential for energy&#8208;efficient electronic devices.

Biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitectures (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) have been constructed for precision inflammation and immune homeostasis modulation to combat rheumatoid arthritis. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of exceptional antioxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, extracellular vesicles&#8208;mediated inflammation targeting, and ultrasound&#8208;assisted cellular uptake, the BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO effectively reprograms macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates hypoxia to inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and ultimately confers bone/cartilage protection and restores joint function.








Abstract
The chronic inflammatory milieu of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), marked by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), perpetually activated pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages (M1) and osteoclasts, and significant infiltration of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines contributes to abnormal articular redox imbalance, severe synovitis, and progressive joint erosion. In this study, the rational design of a biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture comprising Ru cluster&#8208;anchored hydroxylated Fe2O3 (Ru&#8208;HFO) encapsulated within bone marrow stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (BEVs), for precision inflammation modulation to combat RA is proposed. When combined with ultrasound (US) stimulation, this biocatalytic and inflammation&#8208;targeting nanoarchitecture (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) can reprogram macrophages and osteoclasts to restore redox and immune homeostasis, thereby alleviating RA. The findings reveal that the hydroxylation strategy enhances electron density at Ru redox centers and fine&#8208;tunes the binding affinity of oxygen intermediates, thereby ensuring exceptional multi&#8208;enzymatic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities. Notably, under ultrasonic irradiation, BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO targets inflamed joints, promotes the local accumulation of anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates the hypoxic microenvironment to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. This ultimately confers bone and cartilage protection and restores joint function. It is posit that this biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture, with its superior antioxidant and immunomodulatory capabilities, represents a promising strategy for engineering ROS&#8208;catalytic materials to treat RA and potentially many other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell Atlas&#8208;Inspired Hitchhiking Therapeutic Strategy for Acute Pancreatitis by Restricting ROS in Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study discloses the first comprehensive single&#8208;cell differentiation atlas of neutrophils during acute pancreatitis. A neutrophil&#8208;targeted nanoreactor is developed to regulate neutrophil polarization by restricting intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. This strategy effectively alleviates inflammation, offering new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.








Abstract
Neutrophils can undergo transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming in disease, thus causing inflammation or modulating tissue repair and fibrosis. A thorough understanding of the neutrophil subpopulation composition and their polarization processes in acute pancreatitis (AP) is essential to open up design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Herein, this study distinct subgroups and two differentiation pathways associated with N1 and N2 polarization during AP by single&#8208;cell sequencing. Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)&#8208;based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil&#8208;binding Ly&#8208;6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single&#8208;cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils.

         <title>Probing the Effect of Electrode Thermodynamics on Reaction Heterogeneity in Thick Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thick electrodes promise higher battery energy density but suffer from reaction heterogeneity. While typically attributed to sluggish charge transport, this study shows how thermodynamic properties of active materials also have critical influence. Through advanced X&#8208;ray characterization of LiFePO4 and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 thick electrodes, stark differences in their reaction gradients are revealed and a predictive metric to guide electrode design is introduced.








Abstract
Thick electrodes present a viable strategy for enhancing energy density and reducing manufacturing costs of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, reaction heterogeneity during cycling compromises their rate capability and cycle life. While this nonuniformity is commonly attributed to sluggish charge transport, it is demonstrated here that the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material play an equally critical role. Through combined X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy and absorption near&#8208;edge structure spectroscopy, reaction distributions in LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) thick electrodes with matched porosity and tortuosity are compared. LFP electrodes develop pronounced depth&#8208;oriented state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SOC) gradients that worsen with increasing discharge rates, whereas NMC maintains much more uniform SOC distributions under such conditions. This difference originates from their distinct SOC dependence of equilibrium potentials and is quantifiable through a dimensionless &#8220;reaction uniformity&#8221; number. Intriguingly, LFP thick electrodes also exhibit lateral SOC variations that strengthen during slow discharge. The enhanced reaction uniformity in NMC correlates with better active material utilization and slower capacity fade than LFP, highlighting electrode thermodynamics as a key design consideration for thick electrodes.

         <title>Direct Observation of Optically Active Mid&#8208;Gap Electronic States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride by Electron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work utilizes STEM&#8208;EELS for a direct visualization of defect mediated midgap electronic states (MESs) in hexagonal boron nitride and correlates these states with observed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Optically active point defects in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors have been demonstrated to be attractive for a variety of quantum and nanoscale applications. In particular, color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently gained substantial attention owing to their spectral tunability, brightness, stability, and room&#8208;temperature operation. Despite all of the recent studies, precise detection of the defect&#8208;induced mid&#8208;gap electronic states (MESs) and their simultaneous correlations with the observed emission in hBN remain elusive. Directly probing these MESs provides a powerful approach toward atomic identification and optical control of the defect centers underlying the sub&#8208;bandgap emission in hBN. Combining optical and electron spectroscopy, the existence of mid&#8208;gap absorptive features is revealed at the emissive sites in hBN, along with an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom identification of the underlying defect configuration. The atomically resolved defect structure, primarily constituted by vacancies and carbon/oxygen substitutions, is further studied via first&#8208;principles calculations, which support the correlation with the observed MESs through the electronic density of states. This work provides a direct relationship between the observed visible emission in hBN, the underlying defect structure, and its absorptive MESs, opening venues for atomic&#8208;scale and optical control in hBN for quantum&#160;technology.

         <title>Cu2O/CuVO3 Nano&#8208;Heterojunction as a Highly Active Therapeutic Catalyst for Aggravating Redox Dyshomeostasis of Neoplastic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt&#8208;like heterojunction nanozyme (CVO) with high peroxidase&#8208;like activity is facilely developed for inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis via redox imbalance in tumors. DFT analysis attributes its catalytic efficiency to charge transfer and OH coverage. This study offers useful insights into nanozyme structure&#8208;activity relationships and advances tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic therapy.








Abstract
Redox dyshomeostasis is both a hallmark and a vulnerability of cancer cells, offering multiple avenues for therapeutic intervention. Herein, a belt&#8208;like nano&#8208;heterojunction Cu2O/CuVO3 (CVO) is developed as a potential redox dyshomeostasis inducer by exacerbating ROS levels and compromising antioxidant defense without the need of exogenous stimulations. Steady&#8208;state analysis reveals that CVO exhibits extraordinary reaction velocity and catalytic efficiency (Vmax = 2.32 &#181;m s&#8722;1, Kcat = 0.49 s&#8722;1) in the production of hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Likewise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superb charge&#8208;transferring properties in the heterojunction structure and unique surface coverage rate of CVO primarily dominate the high&#8208;efficient catalytic reactions. Noteworthy, CVO is capable of inducing mitochondria dysfunction by aggravating the cellular redox imbalance, thereby triggering multiple cell death pathways and generating synergistic effects. Transcriptomics analysis outcomes further demonstrate that CVO exerts significant and distinct effects on key biological processes in tumor cells, encompassing but not limited to canonical pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuprotosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the pronounced tumor&#8208;inhibitory efficacy of CVO, which paves a promising pathway for the development of novel nanocatalysts that effectively target cancer through the amplification of redox dyshomeostasis.

&lt;p&gt;A belt-like heterojunction nanozyme (CVO) with high peroxidase-like activity is facilely developed for inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis via redox imbalance in tumors. DFT analysis attributes its catalytic efficiency to charge transfer and OH coverage. This study offers useful insights into nanozyme structure-activity relationships and advances tumor-targeted catalytic therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox dyshomeostasis is both a hallmark and a vulnerability of cancer cells, offering multiple avenues for therapeutic intervention. Herein, a belt-like nano-heterojunction Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CuVO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CVO) is developed as a potential redox dyshomeostasis inducer by exacerbating ROS levels and compromising antioxidant defense without the need of exogenous stimulations. Steady-state analysis reveals that CVO exhibits extraordinary reaction velocity and catalytic efficiency (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; = 2.32 &#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in the production of hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Likewise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superb charge-transferring properties in the heterojunction structure and unique surface coverage rate of CVO primarily dominate the high-efficient catalytic reactions. Noteworthy, CVO is capable of inducing mitochondria dysfunction by aggravating the cellular redox imbalance, thereby triggering multiple cell death pathways and generating synergistic effects. Transcriptomics analysis outcomes further demonstrate that CVO exerts significant and distinct effects on key biological processes in tumor cells, encompassing but not limited to canonical pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuprotosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the pronounced tumor-inhibitory efficacy of CVO, which paves a promising pathway for the development of novel nanocatalysts that effectively target cancer through the amplification of redox dyshomeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Magnonic Crystals Based on Spatiotemporal Plasmon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterials enabling spatiotemporal optical control of spin&#8208;wave transport are demonstrated. These structures integrate periodic stripes of gold nanodisk arrays with low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet films to realize dynamically reconfigurable magnonic crystals. By utilizing localized thermoplasmonic heating, induced by short laser pulses, the system achieves active modulation of the magnonic band structure, including the formation of bandgaps and minibands.








Abstract
Metamaterials, designed to exhibit properties beyond those found in nature, enable unprecedented control over physical phenomena through flexible band structure engineering. This work introduces a hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterial that allows spatiotemporal manipulation of spin&#8208;wave transport at micrometer scales and sub&#8208;microsecond timescales. The system integrates a plasmonic metamaterial, comprising Au nanodisk arrays arranged in a 1D periodic stripe pattern, with a low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film as the spin&#8208;wave transport medium. Short laser pulses (100&#8722;500 ns) excite surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in the plasmonic stripes, inducing thermoplasmonic heating and generating a striped temperature profile. This dynamic thermal modulation periodically alters the YIG film's saturation magnetization, forming a laser&#8208;controlled magnonic crystal. Time&#8208;resolved propagating spin&#8208;wave spectroscopy reveals tunable bandgaps and minibands arising from Bragg reflection. By adjusting the plasmonic stripe pattern, laser pulse duration, or power, this system enables precise control over spin&#8208;wave transport, paving the way for reconfigurable wave&#8208;based computing&#160;devices.

         <title>Quantifying the Effects of Geometric Parameters on the Elastic Properties of Multilayer Graphene Platelet Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element models of multilayer graphene platelet films are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The obtained dimensionless results apply to different types of laminate or multi&#8208;layered materials such as MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre and seashells.








Abstract
Multilayer graphene platelet films (MGPFs) are widely studied for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. The elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of MGPFs are highly sensitive to their geometric parameters, including graphene platelet size, graphene area fraction, and layer count. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, systematically quantifying these effects remains a significant challenge, severely hindering the design of high&#8208;performance MGPFs. Here, realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element (RVE) models of MGPFs are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The results reveal that the dimensionless platelet size, graphene area fraction, and number of platelet layers significantly affect the elastic properties, with detailed quantifications provided for their relationships. The effects of defects on the elastic properties are also explored, offering insights into the dominant deformation mechanisms. Validation against experimental data confirms that the developed RVE models and dimensionless results apply to various multilayer laminate composites, including MGPFs, MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre&#8208;like materials. The findings provide a robust framework and pave the way for optimizing the design of MGPFs and other laminate composites, enabling their potential in diverse applications.

         <dc:description>
This work reports a compact, high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed flexible organic spectrometer featuring an optical cascade architecture that integrates organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors. This organic spectrometer reliably reconstructs monochromatic, narrowband, and broadband spectra reconstruction with high resolution, accuracy, and the capability for absolute spectral irradiance measurement.








Abstract
Spectrometers are indispensable tools for civil and military&#8208;related optoelectronic applications. To meet the requirements of the revolutionary data/AI&#8208;driven era, next&#8208;generation spectrometers must not only be flexible with minimal sizes but exhibit high accuracy and resolution. In this study, a compact, high&#8208;performance, and flexible organic spectrometer is reported, fabricated using solution processing, which employs an optical cascade architecture by integrating organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors. This organic spectrometer can not only achieve a resolution of 0.56&#160;nm, an accuracy of 0.14&#160;nm, and a broad detection range from 400 to 1000&#160;nm but also realize a vital absolute spectral irradiance measurement ranging from 10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;4&#160;W cm&#8722;2 nm&#8722;1. Additionally, its intrinsic flexibility and highly replaceable feasibility of bandgap&#8208;tunable organic materials enable their high applicability with excellent portability and adaptability in the upcoming data/AI&#8208;driven era or scenarios.

         <title>Vectorial Fluorescence Control with Light&#8208;Emitting Metasurfaces for Unidirectional Emission and Incoherent Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs) are constructed for unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside nanoprinting. Such LEM potentially paves the way for next&#8208;generation vectorial light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Ultracompact light emission manipulation is crucial for various applications, including illumination, biosensing, and quantum photonics. Despite significant advancements in lasing manipulation, achieving complex vectorial wavefront control over fluorescence emission is inherently challenging due to its incoherent, omnidirectional, unpolarized, and phase&#8208;random emission characteristics. Here, the light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs), equipped with vectorial manipulation and complex amplitude encoding capabilities, are introduced to realize unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between the LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity of PL unidirectional emission are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM, combined with the enhanced spatial coherence of guided PL, experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside polarization&#8208;multiplexed nanoprinting. This versatile LEM platform provides a simplified approach to vectorial PL manipulation, promising multiple potential applications in nanophotonics and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Charging Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Activated Pyroptosis for Antitumor Immunotherapy via Bioorthogonal Disruption of Succination and Reinvigorating T Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to enhance tumor immunogenicity, reshape the immune microenvironment, and consume immunosuppressive metabolites, an ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozyme with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate that can serve as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhance antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis and reinvigorating T lymphocytes, is constructed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis can trigger strong immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells for antitumor immunotherapy. However, metabolic disorders of fumarate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can significantly reduce the pyroptosis rate and render T lymphocytes dysfunctional. Here, the ultrasound (US)&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based SAzyme (BFTM) with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate (MMB, a bioorthogonal reagent of fumarate) for activating pyroptosis and regulating fumarate metabolism is developed. Positive and negative charges generated by barium titanate (BTO) regulate the electron cloud density of single&#8208;Fe atom, endowing the BFTM with efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ability for triggering caspase&#8208;1 related gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the consumption of intracellular fumarate through bioorthogonal reaction not only prevented the succinate of cysteines in GSDMD, causing it to be activated and oligomerized by caspase&#8208;1 to enhance pyroptosis but also restored the phosphorylation of ZAP70 to normalize the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways for reinvigorating CD8+ T cells. In short, US&#8208;driven BFTM as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhances antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis, and reinvigorating T lymphocytes.

         <title>Infrared Photothermal Catalytic Reduction of Atmospheric CO2 Into CO with 100% Selectivity via Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>

Schematic illustration of the designed environmentally friendly CO synthesis route from infrared&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of atmospheric CO2 over a dual&#8208;plasmonic photocatalyst, in which the dual&#8208;plasmonic effect helps to improve infrared region absorption and promotes carrier space separation, but also reduces CO2 reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Today, the fabrication of carbon monoxide (CO) in industry customarily necessitates elevated temperature and pressure. Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes &#8776;50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO2 photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual&#8208;plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu7Te4 nanowires as an example, the surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO2 photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au&#8208;Cu7Te4 nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO2 reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu7Te4 nanowires.

         <title>Efficient Artificial T Cell Therapy for Bacterial&#8208;Colonized Tumors</title>

Artificial T Cells (ATC) for Tumor Colonization: Combining T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin within a disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;hyaluronic acid hydrogel framework. ATC targets and destroys tumor cells and intracellular bacteria, enhances immune cell infiltration, and inhibits tumor migration, showcasing potential in precision medicine for effective anti&#8208;tumor immunity.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can impede the efficacy of cancer treatments and elevate the risk of metastatic spread. While cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for destroying tumor cells, they lack the ability to eliminate bacteria. Here, the artificial T cells (ATC) are presented for tumors, particularly those colonized with intracellular bacteria. The ATC is composed of a hydrogel framework made of disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan and hyaluronic acid, encapsulating T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin. This design leverages the tumor microenvironment for the targeted release of these antitumor and antibacterial agents to precisely kill tumor cells and intracellular bacteria. In vivo studies demonstrate the debris from ATC&#8208;mediated destruction acts as an immune stimulator, promoting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting tumor migration. This work highlights the potential of ATC therapy in achieving targeted treatment and robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity, advancing the field of artificial cell technologies for precision medicine.

         <title>Designing Moderately&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly&#8208;solvating solvent, a weakly&#8208;solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent. The optimal MSE significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs by doubling that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and enables stable calendar life for at least seven months.








Abstract
New electrolytes are critical for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8211;sulfur (S) batteries (LSBs) to ensure their stability against Li metal anode and polysulfides (PSs) shuttling which hinder the large&#8208;scale application of LSBs. In this study, the design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for LSBs is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly solvating solvent, a weakly solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent to create a well&#8208;balanced electrolyte system. This resulting electrolyte significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs, achieving 300 cycles, which is twice as long as that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and it also ensures stable calendar life for at least seven months. The optimal MSE forms robust passivation layers enhancing the structural integrity of both S and Li metal electrodes after cycling. These virtues effectively hinder parasitic side reactions and self&#8208;discharge behavior of LSBs. This electrolyte design principle is versatile and can be applied to other battery chemistries, providing a potential path toward the development of a more efficient and stable battery system. By addressing key challenges such as the instability of electrodes and shuttling of polysulfides, this electrolyte approach offers promising solutions for advancing LSB technology.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Green Quantum Rod LEDs Enabled by Material and Charge Injection Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS quantum rods with gradient shell, uniform shape, and shortened ligands enable high PLQY and efficient charge injection. Combined with a double hole transport layer structure to suppress electron leakage and enhance hole injection, the resulting QRLEDs achieve 24% EQE, &gt;500&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 brightness, and &gt;22&#8201;000 h T&#8325;&#8320; lifetime, advancing high&#8208;performance display applications.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are a promising technology for the next generation of flexible and large&#8208;area displays, offering high brightness, tunable narrow emission, and high display contrast. Although internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has reached unity, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs utilizing spherical quantum dots (QDs) is limited by low light outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). A promising approach to improve &#951;out is using horizontal alignment of nanocrystals&#8217; transition dipole moments, such as aligned quantum rods (QRs), which provide directional light emission. Though the IQE for QRs has recently improved significantly, creating efficient and bright green&#8208;emitting QRs (515&#8211;560 nm) remains a big challenge, which is essential for full&#8208;color display applications. In this study, a uniform and highly bright green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS QRs of gradient shell structure are synthesized with minimized shell thickness and reduced Zn content, coupled with shorter organic ligands to reduce the energy barriers and enhance carriers injection. The electron leakage current at the interface between the polymeric hole transport layer (HTL) and QRs is the primary factor limiting the QRLED's performance. HTL with a higher energy offset is employed to prevent electron leakage at the organic/inorganic interface. Furthermore, is developed a bilayer HTL that enhances hole injections while minimizing electron leakage, thereby improving charge balance. The resulting QRLEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high efficiency, with an EQE of 24%, current efficiency (CE) of 89 cd&#160;A&#8722;1, and maximum brightness (Lmax) exceeding 500k cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, they exhibited an extended operational T50 lifetime of over 22k h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, making them well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display and lighting applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocrystal-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a promising technology for the next generation of flexible and large-area displays, offering high brightness, tunable narrow emission, and high display contrast. Although internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has reached unity, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs utilizing spherical quantum dots (QDs) is limited by low light outcoupling efficiency (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). A promising approach to improve &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is using horizontal alignment of nanocrystals&#8217; transition dipole moments, such as aligned quantum rods (QRs), which provide directional light emission. Though the IQE for QRs has recently improved significantly, creating efficient and bright green-emitting QRs (515&#8211;560 nm) remains a big challenge, which is essential for full-color display applications. In this study, a uniform and highly bright green-emitting CdSe/Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;S QRs of gradient shell structure are synthesized with minimized shell thickness and reduced Zn content, coupled with shorter organic ligands to reduce the energy barriers and enhance carriers injection.

         <title>Conjugation Pathway of Benzobisoxazoles in Polymer Donors Mediates the Charge Management and Enables Organic Solar Cells with Record Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the conjugation pathway isomerism of the benzobisoxazole (BBO) building block is systematically compared, by which a certified efficiency of 19.1% is obtained in corresponding all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract

Charge management plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, two efficient polymer donors are designed, P[4,8]BBO and P[2,6]BBO, by regulating the conjugation pathways of benzobisoxazoles (BBO) through 4,8&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;linkages, respectively. Comparing to P[2,6]BBO, the isomer of conjugation pathway has been proved to enable P[4,8]BBO a shallower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of &#8722;5.20 eV, significantly enhanced luminescence efficiency, and reduced aggregation property. These improvements lead to a dramatic increase in device efficiencies from 2.6% for P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl to 19.0% for P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl. The combined characterizations show that a better comprehensive charge management can be reached in P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, yielding a significantly higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) parameters compared to P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based&#160;ones. Furthermore, P[4,8]BBO demonstrates good applicability and can achieve an impressive efficiency of 19.4% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells with a third&#8208;party certified efficiency of 19.1%. This work highlights the critical role of conjugation pathway isomerism in mediating polymeric properties and advancing the development of high&#8208;performance multifunctional photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Cracked Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks with Durable Confinement Capillarity for Enhanced Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired cracks are introduced into photothermal metal&#8211;phenolic networks (C&#8208;MPNs). These crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water flow, enabling confinement capillarity to enhance the evaporation rate while preventing salt fouling. The cracks also serve as a buffer zone to significantly enhance the stability of the C&#8208;MPNs, overcoming the bottleneck for the practical applications of confinement capillarity.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination is a promising strategy to address freshwater shortages. Water evaporation can be enhanced through confinement capillarity by generating ultra&#8208;thin water layers on the internal surfaces of porous photothermal materials. However, realizing confinement capillarity relies on coatings composed of aggregated nanospheres, which likely detach under mechanical compression, limiting their practical application. Herein, nature&#8208;inspired crack patterns are introduced into adhesive photothermal supramolecular materials, metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings, forming C&#8208;MPNs to achieve durable confinement capillarity. The crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water transport through narrow channels, enhancing the evaporation rate from 1.6 to 3.3 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 while preventing salt accumulation during seawater desalination. Furthermore, the cracks serve as buffer zones, significantly improving the mechanical stability of C&#8208;MPN coatings under compression (exhibiting negligible change after 300 cycles)&#8212;overcoming a key challenge that has hindered the practical application of confinement capillarity. Furthermore, due to the enhanced confinement capillarity in C&#8208;MPNs, high evaporation performance is sustained even as the size of the photothermal material increases&#8212;a rare characteristic among 3D photothermal materials. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of photothermal coatings with confinement capillarity, paving the way for their application in solar desalination.

         <title>Active Passivation Charge Transport in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells Approaching 26% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic interface engineering strategy for n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells, integrating active passivation and stacked charge transport. A multifunctional SDBA modifier passivates oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and promotes high&#8208;quality SnO2 deposition, optimizing energy level alignment and carrier dynamics. The resulting devices achieve a record PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability and scalability.








Abstract
In n&#8208;i&#8208;p planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transporting layer play a crucial role in realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a TiO2&#8208;SDBA&#8208;SnO2 stacked ETL is reported, where 4,4&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldibenzoic acid (SDBA) serves as an active passivation agent to suppress charge recombination and enhance interface quality. SDBA effectively passivates oxygen vacancies in sputtered TiO2, while simultaneously promoting SnO2 nucleation and improving film quality. Moreover, its molecular structure increases the surface free energy of the ETL, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer defects. As a result, PSCs with this optimized ETL achieve a PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability. This approach also enables the fabrication of perovskite solar modules with a certified efficiency of 22.55% over a 26.02 cm2 aperture area.

Abstract
Dynamic all&#8208;season window is a key energy&#8208;saving solution for maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, current progress faces challenges in balancing weather adaptability, functional tunability, and fabrication costs. This study introduces an all&#8208;season, polyvinyl propional&#8208;liquid&#8208;based asymmetric window. It features a tunable switching temperature ranging from 10 to 70&#160;&#176;C, maintains transparency at temperatures as low as &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C for extended periods, and delivers optimal net cooling (&#8776;246.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) and heating (&#8776;113.9&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) power as derived from the modulation of the optical spectrum, and boasts a service life of over 8 years, with resistance to 1000 thermal shock cycles. The synthesis of the polyvinyl propional liquid involves a zero&#8208;emission process, and the transparent&#8208;to&#8208;cloudy phase transition provides a visually identifiable and theoretically predictable indicator for reaction termination. Additionally, the liquid contains an in situ doped dispersant that functions as a cryoprotectant. Encapsulated between an outward&#8208;facing transparent glass layer and an inward&#8208;facing low&#8208;emissivity glazing, the asymmetric window directional scattering of solar radiation and thermal re&#8208;emission, effectively delivers net cooling in summer and heat retention in winter. This window presents a complementary, affordable, and sustainable solution for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse climatic conditions.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Dry&#8208;Transfer of Single&#8208;Crystalline Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The VTCB technique is developed for wafer&#8208;scale, ultra&#8208;clean stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs with precise angular control. This method overcomes conventional limitations, enhancing interfacial integrity, uniformity, compositional flexibility, and twist&#8208;angle manipulation, exemplified by multilayer 3R&#8208;MoS&#8322; retaining bulk&#8208;like properties. The technique is semiconductor&#8208;process&#8208;compatible, offering a scalable platform for fundamental research and device development.








Abstract
The twisting and stacking of 2D materials have emerged as transformative strategies for discovering novel physical phenomena and designing advanced materials and devices. A significant challenge, however, is achieving pristine interfaces with precise angular control while maintaining the long&#8208;range order over large areas. In this work, a novel dry&#8208;transfer method is presented that enables the ultra&#8208;clean integration of epitaxial, single&#8208;crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) via vacuum thermocompression bonding (VTCB). This technique facilitates the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale twisting and stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs to form homo&#8208;and heterostructures with intrinsic material properties and precise angular control. The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer reconstruction of single&#8208;crystalline multilayer 2H&#8208;and 3R&#8208;MoS2 is demonstrated, with structural, electrical, and optical properties comparable to those of the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, the approach is fully compatible with standard semiconductor fabrication workflows and equipment, offering a scalable pathway for automated high&#8208;throughput fabrication. This findings provide a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale production of multi&#8208;stacked materials and twist&#8208;electronic device arrays.

         <title>Unique Bioinspired Nanowire Structures for Dual&#8208;Modal Optoelectronic Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;electrical (IE) integrated e&#8208;skin with customizable modes is developed by combining interface assembly technique with mechanical strategies. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates an ultrasensitive anisotropic IE e&#8208;skin. In contrast, the Mode II delivers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations.








Abstract
As initial basic applications expand into more complex and diverse fields, including prosthesis, the metaverse, and information encryption, the diversification, multifunctionality, and customization of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) have increasingly become prominent research trends. However, most e&#8208;skins focus on achieving higher performance and a broader response range, lacking functionality and mode customization options. Here, a mode designable bioinspired e&#8208;skin is reported, utilizing a mechanical strategy combined with interface assembly technology, and achieving the integration of optical and electrical sensing capabilities in single functional material. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates for the first time an anisotropic infrared&#8208;electrical combined e&#8208;skin, achieving remarkable anisotropic electrical performance with an anisotropy index (GF1/GF2) greater than 104 and stable anisotropy infrared transmittance changes even after 105 cycles at 75% strain. On the other hand, the Mode II offers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations based on novel 3D buckled structure. Finally, the two modes are integrated and successfully applied to the multiple encryption of customized information, presenting significant potential for confidential military projects.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomers as Initiator&#8208;Free Photochemical Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of dynamic disulfide bonds and halogen bonds in chain&#8208;extended liquid crystal elastomers enables the fabrication of photochemical actuators without the need for a photoinitiator, advancing the design of multimodal soft actuators that can be reprogrammed and reprocessed through supramolecular functionalization.








Abstract
Photochemically driven liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators require precise arrangement and sufficiently high concentration of photoswitchable molecules for effective actuation. Achieving both high photoswitch content and a high degree of molecular alignment has been challenging especially in thick samples, but is essential for future applications in soft robotics, biomedicine, and photonic technologies. In this work, this issue is addressed by combining dynamic halogen bonds with Aza&#8211;Michael addition&#8208;based polymerization, creating azobenzene&#8208;containing LCEs with multimodal actuation capabilities. These highly directional supramolecular interactions eliminate the need for a photo&#8208;initiator in the LCE fabrication process, enabling control over the azobenzene content over a wide range while maintaining a high degree of molecular alignment and dynamic programming ability. The potential of this approach is demonstrated through proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples such as light&#8208;guided rolling movement and underwater gripping, underscoring the versatility of the weak, dynamic halogen bonds in advancing the supramolecular design of multimodal soft actuators.

         <title>Unleashing the Kinetic Limitation of Co&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes via Ionic/Electronic Dual&#8208;Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;effect integration of Na+/F&#8722; dual&#8208;ion surface doping effectively eliminates the intrinsic kinetic limitations of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials, maintains highly stable interfaces, and achieves dual benefits in cycling performance and energy density, providing novel insights for the industrialization of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based solutions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries with combined cost&#8208;effectiveness and high specific capacity. Designing Co&#8208;free LRMO can further leverage the low cost of this class of cathodes given the capacity can be maintained. However, implementing cobalt&#8208;free LRMO cathode materials are hampered by their sluggish kinetics, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance that underperform compared with their Co&#8208;containing counterparts. Here, it is confirmed that the slow kinetics of Co&#8208;free LRMO originates from the structural disorder caused by transition metals (TMs) migration at high voltages (above 4.5&#160;V Vs. Li+/Li) and consequent irreversible oxygen redox process. Aware of this, Na+/F&#8722; is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (&#8776;0.2&#160;V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g&#8722;1), exceptional cycle stability in pouch&#8208;type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45&#160;&#176;C) and excellent C&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;150&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5 C). The newly developed Na+/F&#8722; gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high&#8208;capacity LRMO cathode design.

Aware of this, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (&#8776;0.2&#160;V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), exceptional cycle stability in pouch-type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45&#160;&#176;C) and excellent C-rate performance (&#8776;150&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 C). The newly developed Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high-capacity LRMO cathode design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Schottky MSM&#8208;Structured Tribovoltaic Nanogenerator Enabling Over 25,000 nC Charge Transfer via Single Droplet Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tribovoltaic nanogenerator featuring a Schottky MSM architecture utilizes triboelectric potential to modulate carrier transport. The device leverages interfacial state density and surface conductance engineering to maintain a tunable Schottky barrier. This strategy enables high charge output per droplet and rapid energy storage, showing potential for scalable and practical energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Using water droplets to generate electricity is an attractive approach for addressing the energy crisis. However, achieving high charge transfer and power output in such systems remains a major challenge. Here, a tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG) is developed based on a specially designed Schottky metal&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;metal (MSM) structure. This device is capable of efficiently converting the kinetic energy of water droplets into electricity. To improve performance, a patterned interface layer between the metal and semiconductor is introduced, which helps guide charge flow and control surface conductivity. Upon droplet impact, the mechanical friction between the liquid and the surface generates a potential that activates charge transport across the Schottky barrier. This breaks the equilibrium state and enhances carrier movement. As a result, the device achieves a record&#8208;high charge output of 25500&#160;nC from a single droplet, along with an output energy of 5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&#8310;&#160;J. To showcase scalability, a TVNG module with 60 cells on a 3&#8208;inch wafer delivers milliamp&#8208;level current and charges a 220&#160;&#181;F capacitor to 0.6&#160;V within 2&#160;s. The effects of processing, materials, structure, and droplet properties are studied to guide the future design of high&#8208;efficiency Schottky MSM&#8208;based TVNG.

         <title>Robust Mix&#8208;Charged Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Evaporative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional atmospheric water&#8208;harvesting&#160;hydrogels prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanics, hindering its practical applications. The proposed hygroscopic&#160;mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel(THMPH)&#160;achieves a trade&#8208;off between high water absorption and exceptional mechanical robustness through a strength gradient&#8208;enhanced ionic cross&#8208;linking structure synergized with improvelithium chloride&#160;binding affinity.&#160;This design strategy significantly expands applicability to diverse practical implementations including photovoltaic thermal management.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) presents great potential in addressing the increasing global challenges in freshwater and energy supply, especially in arid and semi&#8208;arid regions. The recent AWH materials focus primarily on maximizing water uptake,&#160;while conventional approaches prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanical integrity, which severely limits their applicability in real&#8208;world scenarios. In this study, a novel tunable hygroscopic mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel (THMPH) is reported that achieves dual excellence in outstanding moisture absorbency and mechanical robustness. Owing to the broad ionic crosslink's degree enabling the rigid skeletal framework and energy&#8208;dissipative sacrificial networks, THMPH exhibits more than 200 times higher mechanical ductility (225&#160;kPa tensile strength retention at 200% mass swelling ratio) in comparison with the commonly&#8208;used AWH zwitterionic polybetaine. The optimized topological structure coupled with improved lithium chloride&#160;binding affinity results in excellent water uptake (2.9&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 70% RH). When THMPH is used for daytime photovoltaic panel cooling, it can provide a 15&#160;&#176;C temperature reduction of a PV panel under 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2 solar irradiation, resulting in a 7.33% increase in solar energy conversion efficiency. This hydrogel design paradigm, synergizing superior hygroscopicity with&#160;exceptional mechanical robustness, demonstrates significant potential for advancing practical applications.

         <title>Local Recruitment of Autologous Stem Cells via a Targeting Microgel for Precise Cartilage Repair without Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;modified hydrogel microsphere containing TGF&#946; affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is designed and synthesized to precisely target multiple scattered cartilage injury sites in advanced osteoarthritis. It can locally capture endogenous TGF&#946; to recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and promote their differentiation into chondrocytes, thereby achieving precise hyaline cartilage repair in vivo without surgery.








Abstract
The treatment of advanced osteoarthritis (OA) remains clinically intractable due to the inability to regenerate multifocal cartilage defects, stemming from poor targeted recruitment of bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the absence of a sustained chondrogenic microenvironment at the injury sites. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated gelatin methacrylate&#8208;based hydrogel microsphere modified by TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is developed, to precisely target and repair scattered cartilage injuries by only intraarticular injection without any surgical assistance. By leveraging the specific expression of type I collagen in OA cartilage lesions, the type I collagen antibodies anchoring on TRG's surface enable the specific and accurate targeting of the multiple injury areas that need regeneration. In the meantime, the TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides incorporated in the TRG microsphere can capture the endogenous TGF&#946;, a growth factor that can recruit BMSCs and promote their differentiation, to precisely induce the hyaline&#8208;like cartilage regeneration locally. In a rat model of advanced OA, a single intra&#8208;articular injection of TRG microspheres can repair scattered cartilage defects, restore glycosaminoglycan deposition, and alleviate joint dysfunction. This study proposes an injection&#8208;based strategy that enables continuous recruitment of endogenous BMSCs for precise cartilage regeneration, eliminating complex invasive procedures and patient discomfort.

         <title>Asymmetric Single&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell Layer Enriching Polar Inherent Hydroxyls Eliminates Interlayer Electric Field Shielding Effect and In Situ Self&#8208;Polarize for Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) monolayer with strong force&#8208;sensitivity eliminates interlayer electric field screening induced by H bond between [Bi2O2OH] and [NO3] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field (IEF). It also incurs sufficient surface polar inherent hydroxyls, benefiting surface charge carrier decoupling and more favorable H2O molecules adsorption and H* desorption. Mechanical strain can induce in situ self&#8208;polarization, which further boosts IEF and reduces energy barriers of H* desorption and key intermediate *OH formation, facilitating piezocatalytic water splitting.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic two&#8208;electron water splitting into spontaneously isolated H2 and H2O2 shows huge prospects in meeting industrial requirements. Herein, asymmetric single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) monolayer (BON&#8208;M) with superb force&#8208;sensitivity are developed for pure water and seawater dissociation. The formation of a monolayer structure allows sufficient exposure of polar inherent hydroxyls and eliminates the interlayer electric field screening induced by hydrogen bonding between [Bi2O2OH] slices and [NO3] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field. It also benefits surface charge carrier decoupling and renders more favorable H2O molecules adsorption and H* desorption. Particularly, the mechanical strain can induce the in situ self&#8208;polarization of BON&#8208;M, which further enhances electric field intensity and reduces energy barriers of H* desorption and key intermediate *OH formation, facilitating water splitting to H2 and H2O2 kinetically and thermodynamically. An exceptional piezocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production rate up to 2071.05 and 970.27&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is delivered by BON&#8208;M from pure water. It also accumulates H2 output of 12&#8201;429.68&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 within 8&#160;h from seawater splitting, along with mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 0.15%. This work develops an effective strategy for exploiting high&#8208;performance piezocatalyst by building ultrafine nanostructure enriched with inherent polar groups on the surface.

Herein, asymmetric single-unit-cell Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) monolayer (BON-M) with superb force-sensitivity are developed for pure water and seawater dissociation. The formation of a monolayer structure allows sufficient exposure of polar inherent hydroxyls and eliminates the interlayer electric field screening induced by hydrogen bonding between [Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH] slices and [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] layers, resulting in larger piezoelectricity and strengthened internal electric field. It also benefits surface charge carrier decoupling and renders more favorable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules adsorption and H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; desorption. Particularly, the mechanical strain can induce the in situ self-polarization of BON-M, which further enhances electric field intensity and reduces energy barriers of H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; desorption and key intermediate &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OH formation, facilitating water splitting to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; kinetically and thermodynamically. An exceptional piezocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate up to 2071.05 and 970.27&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is delivered by BON-M from pure water. It also accumulates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output of 12&#8201;429.68&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within 8&#160;h from seawater splitting, along with mechanical-to-hydrogen efficiency of 0.15%. This work develops an effective strategy for exploiting high-performance piezocatalyst by building ultrafine nanostructure enriched with inherent polar groups on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically&#8208;Thin Freestanding Racetrack Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin and flexible freestanding racetrack membranes are fabricated using a water&#8208;soluble Sr3Al2O6 release layer, without a buffer between the release layer and the magnetic heterostructure. The absence of any buffer layer enables local modulation of the current&#8208; and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization via direct coupling with patterned platinum underlayers, showing potential for advanced spintronic applications.








Abstract
Advances in freestanding membranes allow novel heterostructures to be formed from distinct families of materials in 2D or 3D configurations. Recently, this technique has been used to form a 3D racetrack memory device by transferring a complex magnetic thin film heterostructure, in the form of a membrane, onto a corrugated surface. The membrane is released using a water&#8208;soluble oxide layer (Sr3Al2O6). The magnetic structure within the membrane is supported by a thin buffer layer (MgO), which decouples the magnetic structure from the receiving surface. Here it is shown that ultrathin freestanding racetrack membranes can be formed without any buffer layer and that the current&#8208;induced motion of magnetic domain walls within the transferred racetrack is highly efficient. Furthermore, the absence of any buffer layer enables local engineering of the racetracks via their direct coupling with pre&#8208;patterned platinum underlayers on which they are placed. The presence or absence of the Pt underlayer allows for local modulation of the current and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization. In addition, the ultrathin freestanding membranes exhibit excellent flexibility and enable highly reliable racetrack devices. The findings highlight the potential of freestanding magnetic heterostructure membranes for advanced spintronic applications.

         <title>Breaking the Vicious Spiral to Suppress Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of oxygen loss/redox in layered Li&#8322;MnO&#8323; and spinel Li&#8324;Mn&#8325;O&#8321;&#8322; is comparatively studied. The nanovoids as a result of the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and TM migration, facilitate O2 release in Li2MnO3, whereas O2 is trapped in stable Li4Mn5O12. Unraveling the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox reversibility sheds light on designing of advanced oxide cathode materials.








Abstract
The irreversible oxygen loss (O&#8208;loss) hinders the application of oxygen redox (O&#8208;redox) cathode material in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Although O&#8208;loss is commonly associated with O2 release, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, which is not a simple surface problem. Herein, the O&#8208;loss/redox behaviors of the layered Li2MnO3 and spinel Li4Mn5O12 are comparatively investigated through experiments and density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations. It shows that the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and Mn migration drive the void growth, chain&#8208;like structural collapse, and O2 release in Li2MnO3. In contrast, the stable spinel framework and inert O in O&#8208;LiMn3 coordination of Li4Mn5O12 break this spiral and trap O2 within the bulk, ensuring a reversible O&#8208;redox. By atomically compositing Li4Mn5O12 with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a novel Co&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich spinel oxide (LRSO) with high energy density (&gt;1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) is produced. These findings clarify the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox and contribute to the design of advanced O&#8208;redox cathode materials.

         <title>A Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Strategy to Directly Generate Photosensitizer&#8208;Engineered Extracellular Vesicles from Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and effective metabolic approach utilizing glucose&#8208;modified photosensitizer as substrate is employed for the in situ biosynthesis of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched with photosensitizers. This strategy offers increased yield and high labeling efficiency of engineered EVs. Moreover, the extracted engineered EVs exhibite excellent targeting ability and superior photodynamic therapy efficacy for inducing tumor ablation.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential for delivering cancer therapy drugs. However, limited efficiency and sophisticated drug encapsulation procedures have hindered their effectiveness. Herein, &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose is modified with the synthesized photosensitizer (1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)&#8208;4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium, named TB) via amide bond to form a glucose&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer, referred to as TBG, which is further utilized as a metabolic substrate for cancer cells. Through simple co&#8208;incubation with TBG, cancer cells directly generate TBG&#8208;engineered EVs in situ via a metabolism&#8208;driven process, in which glucose transporters play a critical role. Notably, a higher yield of engineered EVs is observed in TBG&#8208;treated cells compared to the TB&#8208;treated group. This enhancement could be attributed to increased glucose transporter activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, highlighting the significance of glucose&#8208;modified chemicals. Remarkably, this metabolism&#8208;driven strategy has been successfully validated across three cell lines, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability. The extracted TBG&#8208;EVs maintain a strong targeting ability toward cancer cells and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy for tumor ablation. The study offers an alternative strategy to efficiently produce cargo&#8208;loading EVs via direct biological metabolism.

         <title>Excellent Energy Storage Performance of Polymorphic Modulated Antiferroelectric Lead Zirconate Ceramic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special antiferroelectric state composed of the coexistence of polymorphic polarization configurations has been identified, and two completely different non&#8208;ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states are sequentially induced from its matrix. This kind of phase transition simultaneously provides high maximum polarization and fast domain dynamics response. The energy storage density exceeds 23 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and the energy storage efficiency can reach 88%.








Abstract
Multiphase transition type antiferroelectric lead zirconate is one of the ideal candidate dielectrics for energy storage ceramic capacitors, it is challenging to fully reveal its formation and regulation mechanism, and further enhance the energy storage performance. Here, the essence of polymorphic modulation of multiphase transition antiferroelectric is proposed, and its non&#8208;ergodic relaxor phase transition nature is revealed. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics show a giant energy storage density of 23.73 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an excellent efficiency of 88%, which is much superior to the commensurate and incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phases and other dielectric ceramics. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramic is composed of both commensurate and incommensurate modulated ferrielectric like antiferroelectric sub&#8208;grain regions.

     alt="Excellent Energy Storage Performance of Polymorphic Modulated Antiferroelectric Lead Zirconate Ceramic"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special antiferroelectric state composed of the coexistence of polymorphic polarization configurations has been identified, and two completely different non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states are sequentially induced from its matrix. This kind of phase transition simultaneously provides high maximum polarization and fast domain dynamics response. The energy storage density exceeds 23 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the energy storage efficiency can reach 88%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiphase transition type antiferroelectric lead zirconate is one of the ideal candidate dielectrics for energy storage ceramic capacitors, it is challenging to fully reveal its formation and regulation mechanism, and further enhance the energy storage performance. Here, the essence of polymorphic modulation of multiphase transition antiferroelectric is proposed, and its non-ergodic relaxor phase transition nature is revealed. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics show a giant energy storage density of 23.73 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and an excellent efficiency of 88%, which is much superior to the commensurate and incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phases and other dielectric ceramics. The polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramic is composed of both commensurate and incommensurate modulated ferrielectric like antiferroelectric sub-grain regions. Under an electric field, relaxor ferroelectric and ferroelectric phases are successively derived from the incommensurate and commensurate antiferroelectric regions, constituting two distinct non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric states. The independent evolution of antiferroelectric short-range to ferroelectric short-range and ferroelectric long-range, and their interaction are the key to the excellent energy storage performance of polymorphic modulated antiferroelectric ceramics. The findings offer a novel insight into the field-induced phase transition in antiferroelectric, and promote the potential applications of pulse power antiferroelectric ceramic capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterocluster&#8208;Assembled Crystalline Hydrophobic Complexes with Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia, integrating [Sn4O8] and [Cu8S8] SBUs via a bifunctional m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (D&#8208;A ligand) is presented. The donor&#8211;acceptor heterojunction spatially separates HOMO ([Cu8S8] core) and LUMO (carboxylate), enabling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) through minimized &#916;EST, driven by D&#8208;A ligand&#8208;enhanced CT&#8208;state emission. mMBA suppresses nonradiative decay while hydrophobic Sn&#8324; units confer hydrolytic stability without quenching Cu&#8211;S luminescence. This work pioneers heterocluster MOFs for stable optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metal&#9472;sulfur bonds exhibit unique electrical, redox, and optical properties. However, their development has been hindered by rapid nucleation during crystallization. To address this challenge, amine&#8208;based modulators to retard nucleation through competitive coordination with ligands, enabling the synthesis of a series of Cu&#8208;S cluster&#8208;based MOFs with diverse network topologies: Cu&#8208;BDT&#8208;hcb (1), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;acs (2), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;pcu (3), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;sql (4), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;dia (5), and Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;hcb (6), are utilized. Using donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ligands (o/p&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid&#8212;o/pMBA), [Sn4]&#8208;based MOFs: Sn&#8208;oDTBA&#8208;cds (7) and Sn&#8208;pDTBA&#8208;pcu (8), are fabricated. During synthesis, sulfhydryl groups underwent reductive coupling to generate novel dicarboxylate ligands with disulfide (S&#8211;S) linkages. Notably, the first bimetallic heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia (9), incorporating both a metal&#8208;oxygen cluster [Sn4O2(carboxylate)4] and a metal&#8208;sulfur cluster [Cu8(thiolate)8] is developed. This framework, constructed using m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (mMBA) as a D&#8211;A bifunctional ligand, exhibits spatially separated HOMO and LUMO, minimizing the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap to promote thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Compound 9 also demonstrates exceptional hydrolytic stability due to steric shielding by hydrophobic organotin moieties. This work pioneers a modulator&#8208;assisted strategy for heterocluster MOF construction, offering a paradigm for designing stable luminescent materials with tailored optoelectronic functionalities.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Phototransistor Based on a 2D Polybenzimidazole Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline 2D polybenzimidazole polymer (2DPBI), incorporating a porphyrin&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;system linked via 1,3&#8208;diazole units, is synthesized on the water surface over large areas. The 2DPBI thin&#8208;film exhibits high charge carrier mobility (&#8776;240 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, measured by terahertz spectroscopy), strong photoresponse, and band&#8208;like transport, enabling phototransistor performance with a detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, highlighting its potential for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photodetectors are fundamental components of modern optoelectronics, enabling the conversion of light into electrical signals. The development of high&#8208;performance phototransistors necessitates materials with both high charge carrier mobility and robust photoresponse. However, achieving both in a single material poses challenges due to inherent trade&#8208;offs. Herein, this study introduces a polybenzimidazole&#8208;(1,3&#8208;diazole)&#8208;based 2D polymer (2DPBI), synthesized as few&#8208;layer, crystalline films covering &#8776;28 cm2 on the water surface at room temperature, with large crystalline domain sizes ranging from 110 to 140 &#181;m2. The 2DPBI incorporates a &#960;&#8208;conjugated photoresponsive porphyrin motif through a 1,3&#8208;diazole linkage, exhibiting enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, a narrow direct band gap of &#8776;1.18&#160;eV, a small reduced electron&#8211;hole effective mass (m* = 0.171&#160;m0), and a very high resonant absorption coefficient of up to 106 cm&#8722;1. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals excellent short&#8208;range charge carrier mobility of &#8776;240 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoconductivity measurements and theoretical calculations confirm a band&#8208;like charge transport mechanism. Leveraging these features, 2DPBI&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate an on/off ratio exceeding 108, photosensitivity of 1.08 &#215; 107, response time of 1.1&#160;ms, and detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, surpassing previously reported standalone few&#8208;layer 2D materials and are on par with silicon photodetectors. The unique characteristics of 2DPBI make it a promising foundation for future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Observation of Ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Paraelectric Phase Transition in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;dependent nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution and the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in 2D halide perovskites is visualized using piezoresponse force microscopy. The phase transition initiates locally below the Curie temperature and progressively propagates as paraelectric regions expand. Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of ferroelectric domains.








Abstract
2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications and intriguing fundamental properties. However, their temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric behaviors, particularly at the nanoscale, remain poorly understood. In this study, the nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution with temperature and ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 films are investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Angle&#8208;resolved lateral PFM (LPFM) reveals a complex in&#8208;plane ferroelectric domain structure. Temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM measurements clearly show that the Curie temperature (TC) is &#8776;353 K, as confirmed by other macroscopic measurements. Notably, it is observed that the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition initiates locally even below TC. As the temperature increases, large ferroelectric domains fragment into smaller ones and the regions with the novel LPFM phase signal emerge, indicating a local phase transition. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM spectroscopy demonstrates a progressive weakening of the ferroelectricity. The analysis based on Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of nanoscale ferroelectric domains observed in LPFM images. This spatially resolved observation of phase transition provides critical insights into the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics and establishes a foundational framework for their future device applications.

&lt;/i&gt;. As the temperature increases, large ferroelectric domains fragment into smaller ones and the regions with the novel LPFM phase signal emerge, indicating a local phase transition. Furthermore, temperature-dependent LPFM spectroscopy demonstrates a progressive weakening of the ferroelectricity. The analysis based on Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second-order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of nanoscale ferroelectric domains observed in LPFM images. This spatially resolved observation of phase transition provides critical insights into the temperature-dependent ferroelectric properties of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics and establishes a foundational framework for their future device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Organic D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Scintillators for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient organic D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A scintillators with temperature adaptability are presented, achieved through strategic fluorine atom modification of &#960;&#8208;bridge. These materials simultaneously exhibit TADF, AIDF, and RTP that dynamically respond to environmental changes under ultraviolet excitation. Their PLQYs can reach up to 88% in PMMA films. Notably, 1FAT@PMMA exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance, achieving a remarkably low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and an impressive spatial resolution of 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient organic scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging remains a significant challenge, primarily owing to the inherent difficulty in facilitating rapid radiative decays of both singlet and triplet excitons. To address this limitation, a novel design strategy is introduced that incorporated fluorine atoms to modify the &#960;&#8208;bridge of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules, thereby fine&#8208;tuning their electronic structures and photophysical properties. The emitters, namely 1FAT and 2FAT, show excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), aggregation&#8208;induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF), and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) excited by ultraviolet light varying with surrounding environments. Notably, the doped PMMA film of 1FAT exhibites intense emission across a broad temperature range from 77 to 363 K, showcasing its adaptability to diverse thermal conditions. More importantly, 1FAT@PMMA film exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance under X&#8208;ray excitation with a low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of over 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. This study introduces a novel and fundamental design strategy for developing efficient, temperature&#8208;adaptive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A organic scintillators, significantly expanding their potential applications in flexible, stretchable X&#8208;ray detectors and advanced imaging technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;Atomic Catalyst with Axial Chloride Coordination for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group metal (low&#8208;PGM) catalysts play a vital role in reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, an axially Cl&#8208;coordinated Pt&#8208;Co dual atom on N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon catalyst (denoted as Pt1Co1/NC&#8211;Cl) is rationally designed. Owing to the axial chlorine ligand and asymmetric coordination environment, the catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Low&#8208;platinum&#8208;group metal (low&#8208;PGM) catalysts play a crucial role in reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Dual&#8208;atomic catalysts offer valuable solutions due to their exceptional performance. This work explores the application of axial Cl&#8208;coordinated Pt&#9472;Co dual atoms on N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (Pt1Co1/NC&#9472;Cl) catalysts utilizing PtCo dual&#8208;atomic catalysts, demonstrating their ability to significantly enhance the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance of conventional PtCo catalysts. The half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) reaches 0.841 V in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution, and only a reduction of 12 mV in E1/2 is observed after 5000 cycles. Axial Cl proves to be resistant to removal during the electroreduction reaction. Consequently, the use of heteroatom&#8208;modulated asymmetric structures can greatly improve the performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Incorporating nonmetallic synergistic Pt&#8208;group metals presents a promising solution for achieving high&#8208;performance Low&#8208;PGMs.

         <title>Tuning Surface Coordination Environment of Ni3N by Fluorine Modification for Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation Assisted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a fluorine&#8208;modified Ni3N electrocatalyst for the efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Fluorine tuning enhances surface reconstruction, optimizing activity and stability. The catalyst achieves exceptional bifunctional performance, offering insights into electrocatalyst regulation and surface dynamics in electrochemical oxidation.








Abstract
Replacing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising strategy for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. However, optimizing electrocatalytic performance in the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and MOR requires precise regulation of the electrochemical coordination environment and a fundamental understanding of activity origins, posing a significant challenge. Here, a scalable strategy is developed that harnesses the high electronegativity of fluorine (F) to tailor the coordination environment of Ni3N, enhancing HER kinetics. Concurrently, adsorbed F&#160;ions induce rapid and extensive self&#8208;reconstruction of the Ni3N surface during MOR by dynamically modulating interfacial ion concentrations (OH&#8315; and Ni species). This reconstruction enhances catalytic activity and enables the selective oxidation of methanol to formate via a sequential pathway, involving primary O&#8208;H bond activation followed by subsequent C&#8208;H bond cleavage at Ni active sites. Consequently, F10&#8208;Ni3N demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, delivering 2.02&#160;V and remarkable stability (600&#160;h) for MOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production in a membrane electrode assembly&#8208;based flow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a dual&#8208;regulation paradigm for electrocatalysts, offering mechanistic insights into surface reconstruction and a rational design framework for next&#8208;generation energy conversion systems.

         <title>Molecularly Interlocked Interfaces Enable Record&#8208;Efficiency Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategy synergizes molecular&#8208;scale topological entanglement with mesoscale gradient modulus transitions, enabling organic solar cells to achieve record&#8208;breaking PCE of 19.58% while maintaining &gt;10% efficiency at 100% strain&#8208;unprecedented in stretchable energy devices.








Abstract
The development of stretchable organic solar cells (s&#8208;OSCs) demands concurrent breakthroughs in mechanical compliance and electronic properties, and the challenge is rooted in the intrinsic mechanical mismatch between organic semiconductors and metal electrodes. Here, this study proposes dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategies to reconcile these conflicting requirements through molecularly interlocked conductive elastomers. Dynamic stress dissipation through dynamic bond plasticity is achieved by embedding a 3D interpenetrating conducting elastomer network within the electron transport layer (ETL). The strategy creates gradient modulus interfaces through Ag coordination&#8208;enabled nanocomposite bonding, suppressing crack propagation velocities and reduces the interfacial mechanical mismatch phenomenon. Eventually, the PCE of 19.58% is achieved on the small&#8208;area flexible devices, which is one of the highest PCEs for flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) to date. Notably, the stretchable devices retain over the PCE of 10% under 100% tensile strain, surpassing previous stretchable photovoltaic devices. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, 25 cm2&#8208;based flexible and stretchable modules are prepared with PCEs of 16.74% and 14.48%, respectively. The work redefines material design rules for deformable electronics by establishing a generic mechanically adaptive framework that synchronizes interfacial dynamics across molecular to macroscopic scales.

         <title>Manipulating Ferroelectric Topological Polar Structures with Twisted Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate dynamic control of ferroelectric order in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 using twisted ultraviolet light carrying orbital angular momentum. Our approach harnesses non&#8208;resonant multiphoton absorption and induced strain to modulate topological of ferroelectric polarization textures. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray coherent imaging and Raman spectroscopy reveal reversible, nanoscale polarization transitions, enabling efficient stabilization of topological solitons and paving the way for novel optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The dynamic control of non&#8208;equilibrium states represents a central challenge in condensed matter physics. While intense terahertz fields drive metal&#8208;insulator transitions and ferroelectricity via soft phonon modes, recent theory suggests that twisted light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers a distinct route to manipulate ferroelectric order and stabilize topological excitations including skyrmions, vortices, and Hopfions. Control of ferroelectric polarization in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 (CBNO) is demonstrated using non&#8208;resonant twisted ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light (375 nm, 800 THz). Combining in situ X&#8208;ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI), twisted optical Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT), three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ionic displacements, strain fields, and polarization changes are resolved in single crystals. Operando measurements reveal light&#8208;induced strain hysteresis under twisted light&#8211;a hallmark of nonlinear, history&#8208;dependent ferroelastic switching driven by OAM. Discrete, irreversible domain transitions emerge as the topological charge &#8467; is cycled, stabilizing non&#8208;trivial domain textures including vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs, Bloch/anti&#8208;Bloch points, and merons. These persist after OAM removal, indicating a memory effect. Competing mechanisms are discussed, including multiphoton absorption, strain&#8208;mediated polarization switching, and defect&#8208;wall interactions. The findings establish structured light as a tool for deterministic, reversible control of ferroic states, enabling optically reconfigurable non&#8208;volatile&#160;devices.

         <title>Phonon Driven Ferroelectricity and Raman Active Modes in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric domains, a hallmark of ferroelectricity, are studied using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy to uncover characteristic phonons associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in different n&#8208;value HOIPs. Higher n&#8208;value HOIP demonstrate a reduced ferroelectric switching energy barrier, providing valuable insights for optimizing domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising ferroelectric semiconductors, yet the phonon signatures governing their ferroelectricity remain poorly understood. Here, by analyzing the temperature&#8208;dependent Raman peak profiles of highly ordered ferroelectric domains in HOIPs, a framework to systematically investigate the dimensionality (n)&#8208;dependent phonons that are critical to ferroelectric behaviour is established. By tracking phonon evolution across the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in HOIPs with different n, characteristic modes associated with the ferroelectric symmetry&#8208;breaking process are identified. Notably, in the ferroelectric phase of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (n = 3), these modes exhibit a redshift compared to those in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (n = 2), reflecting a reduced energy barrier for ferroelectric switching. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further correlate these modes with their spectral signatures in Raman spectroscopy, particularly highlighting zone&#8208;boundary modes that diminish upon transitioning to the paraelectric phase. Polarized Raman mapping further reveals adjacent ferroelectric domains with orthogonal polarization orientations, directly linking phonon activity to domain configuration. This work elucidates the role of phonons in HOIP ferroelectricity, offering insights for tailoring domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Intranasal and Intravenous Sequential Administration of Survivin Peptide&#8208;CpG Nanovaccines Elicits Potent Immunity Toward Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A survivin peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccine, SPOD&#8208;NV, is designed for GBM immunotherapy. Using a strategic sequential administration through intranasal and intravenous routes, it capitalizes on the advantages of both methods exhibiting enhanced accumulation in tumors, NALT, CLNs and spleen. Combined with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy, it effectively activates local and systemic T&#8208;cell and humoral responses, achieving 43% complete remission and long&#8208;lasting immune memory in orthotopic GBM models.








Abstract
Peptide vaccines hold great promise for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), though their efficacy remains suboptimal due to factors such as immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, poor accessibility to tumor site and inadequate activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Here, this work reports on survivin peptide&#8208;CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) nanovaccines (SPOD&#8208;NV), which feature antigen peptides strategically displayed on polymersomes with CpG ODN encapsulated as an immunostimulatory adjuvant. Sequential administration via intranasal and intravenous routes elicits robust immune response against murine GBM. These results demonstrate that SPOD&#8208;NV significantly enhances mucosa penetration and markedly improves dendritic cell uptake and activation. Notably, the intranasal administration of SPOD&#8208;NV to orthotopic murine GL261 tumor models reveals marked accumulation in cervical lymph nodes and tumors, likely facilitated by lymphatic transport from nasal mucosa and pathways via olfactory bulb and trigeminal nerve, bypassing the blood&#8208;brain barrier. Interestingly, the therapeutic strategy, comprising three intranasal and two intravenous administrations of SPOD&#8208;NV in combination with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody, results in substantial tumor inhibition, achieving a 43% complete regression rate, in line with the stimulation of robust and long&#8208;lasting local and systemic anti&#8208;GBM immune responses. These intranasal&#8208;intravenous administration strategy of peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccines provides a potential curative therapy for brain tumors, paving the way for further developments in GBM immunotherapy.

Facile structural transformation&#8208;induced in situ core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly for constructing mono&#8208;dispersed aqueous colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, exhibiting unprecedented aqueous solution single photon emission.








Abstract
Aqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono&#8208;disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra&#8208;dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room&#8208;temperature structural transformation&#8208;induced&#160;in situ&#160;core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre&#8208;core&#8208;shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit &gt;80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential &gt;80 mV) even after &gt;10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single&#8208;photon emission with&#160;g(2)(0) &lt;0.2 at concentrations as low as &#8776;0.1 nM is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability&#160;that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.

         <title>Dopamine Dopes the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. The DACl SAM enhances interfacial contact, boosts power conversion efficiency, promotes uniform film formation, reduces defects, and enhances the long&#8208;term performance of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The electron transport layer (ETL) is a crucial component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as it greatly influences their photovoltaic performance. Among various currently used ETL materials, SnO&#8322; stands out due to its unique advantages, including low&#8208;temperature fabrication and rapid electron extraction capability and excellent energy match of its conduction band edge with that of the commonly used perovskite formulations. However, the currently employed SnO&#8322; layers contain surface defects, such as hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies that impair the desired growth of highly crystalline and defect less perovskite films during solution processing of n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs reducing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. Here, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. Introducing the dopamine SAM at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite increases substantially the solar&#8208;to&#8208;electric PCE while greatly enhancing the PSC stability. This findings demonstrate the surprising benefits of this well&#8208;known neurotransmitter for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs which this is rationalized here by DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.

         <title>Dual Strategy of Ca2+ Influx and Collagen Denaturation to Remodel the Extracellular Matrix and Amplify Sonopiezoelectric Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap of noncentrosymmetric Cu3BiS3 nanospheres facilitates charge&#8208;carrier separation under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in a favorable sonopiezoelectric response and reactive oxygen generation. External stimulation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and amplifies cellular oxidative damage. Ca2+ influx and collagen denaturation induced by the piezoelectric signal and photothermal effect facilitated extracellular matrix remodeling.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is &#8776;1.5&#8208;fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues. Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration. Herein, a sonopiezoelectric&#8208;response nanoplatform consisting of Cu3BiS3 nanospheres (CBS NSs) is constructed for ECM remodeling. Sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are conducted using ultrasound (US) and near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Under US irradiation, the mechanical strain of CBS NSs causes piezoelectric polarization and promotes a redox reaction through energy band bending. The built&#8208;in electric field generated by US irradiation amplifies the efficiency of the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and substantially enhances reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, piezoelectric property&#8208;mediated electrical signals can allow Ca2+ influx, upregulating the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;2 and MMP&#8208;9. Integrating US irradiation with near&#8208;infrared irradiation generates localized heat, which can effectively denature tumor collagen, reduce tumor stiffness, and enhance the permeability of CBS NSs into solid tumors, thus improving the SPT effect. The combination of MMP upregulation and collagen degradation can maximize the benefits of ECM remodeling and synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy of SPT/CDT. This SPT/CDT synergistic therapy and ECM remodeling platform is an innovative strategy for cancer therapy.

         <title>Revealing the Underlying Role of Li2CO3 in Enhancing Performance of Oxyhalide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with oxyhalide electrolytes benefit from residual lithium compounds (RLCs) like Li&#8322;CO&#8323;, which enhance lithium ion mobility and interfacial dynamics. This study reveals untreated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes outperform washed ones, challenging conventional views of RLCs and offering insights to improve ASSB performance.









Abstract
Residual lithium compounds (RLCs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials (LiNixCoyMnzO2, NCM) are traditionally viewed either as ionically and electronically insulating layers hindering electrochemical performance or as protective buffer layers enhancing cycling stability. In this study, a beneficial role of Li2CO3 in ASSBs featuring an oxyhalide&#8208;based AlOCl&#8208;2LiCl (LAOC) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) is revealed. ASSBs containing NCM with residual Li2CO3 demonstrate superior electrochemical performance compared to those treated with a washing pretreatment to remove Li2CO3. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy shows that Li2CO3 facilitates spontaneous Li+ exchange at multiple sites within the LAOC SSE. This leads to faster ion mobility and shorter relaxation times at various lithium sites, indicating enhanced ion transport and improved interface dynamics. Moreover, the beneficial effects of Li2CO3 are confirmed in other halide&#8208;based ASSBs. This study uncovers an unexpected role for Li2CO3 in halide&#8208;based ASSBs, offering insights that may inspire further exploration of RLCs with functional properties for improving ASSBs performance.

         <title>Stretchable, Multiplexed, and Bimodal Sensing Electronic Armor for Colonoscopic Continuum Robot Enhanced by Triboelectric Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colonoscopic continuum robots lack sensing, endangering intestinal tissue. An ideal sensing array is hard to integrate. This work introduces a 3D crosslinked stretchable E&#8208;armor with full&#8208;coverage and multiplexing. It has bimodal sensing, forms a triboelectric synapse, uses CNN&#8208;LSTM, and has a hydrogel and innovative triboelectric materials. A control strategy and digital twin interface enhance safety and interaction in colonoscopy.








Abstract
Colonoscopic continuum robots often lack sensing capabilities, risking tissue damage. An ideal robot electronic skin should offer full&#8208;body coverage, multiplexing, stretchability, and multifunctionality, but integration is challenging due to the robot's elongated structure. This work presents a stretchable electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) with a 3D crosslinked structure that enables 300&#160;mm full coverage while accomplishing multiplexed simultaneous tactile and strain sensing through bioinspired artificial synapse mechanisms. The E&#8208;armor integrates 48 tactile sensing points through bilayer co&#8208;electrode strategy, reducing wiring while combining triboelectric encoding intelligence with innovative stretchable triboelectric interlinked films (TIFs) to form a triboelectric artificial synapse that generates digitally encoded signal pairs upon contact. A convolutional neural network and long short&#8208;term memory network (CNN&#8208;LSTM) deep learning framework achieve 99.31% accuracy in identifying multi&#8208;point tactile signals. A sodium alginate/polyacrylamide/sodium chloride (SA/PAM/NaCl) conductive hydrogel serves as a strain sensing element, providing excellent stretchability and biocompatibility, and allowing precise inference of bending angles at 12 strain sensing edges. A compliance control strategy coordinates tactile and strain signals to autonomously adjust continuum robot postures while ensuring smooth operation. The digital twin&#8208;based 3D visualization interface enhances human&#8211;robot interaction by digitally reconstructing both tactile and strain feedback, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of the continuum robot's intracolonic posture.

The atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system is successfully constructed, which can remarkably endogenous targeted catalysis and enhance tumor photothermal therapy. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared range. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors.








Abstract
Nanozymes hold great potential in protecting human health. However, constructing new and efficient nanozymes is a significant challenge. Developing atomic&#8208;level nanozymes is a promising approach. Despite their potential, atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes have not been reported due to thermodynamic instability. Therefore, developing atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes are of great significance. What's more, further exploring their biomedical applications can open up new horizons for nanozymology. Here, the atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system capable of remarkable endogenous targeted catalysis and enhancing tumor photothermal therapy is successfully constructed. The system is prepared by reduction&#8208;diffusion and grafting methods. The RuRhPtIrMo sub&#8208;nanometer high&#8208;entropy nanozyme (snHEAzyme) with about 8&#8211;10 atoms thickness is first prepared. Then, they are grafted by targeting agent DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD and imaging agent Cy7 to obtain the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 nanozyme system. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Under NIR irradiation, the nanozyme shows efficient photothermal conversion and reactive oxygen species generation effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors. This work offers a new perspective on snHEAzyme fabrication and its biomedical applications.

         <title>Bismuthene Under Cover: Graphene Intercalation of a Large Gap Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuthene, a quantum spin Hall insulator with a massive 800 meV topological gap, holds great potential for room&#8208;temperature devices but rapidly degrades in air. This study demonstrates that intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a graphene sheet preserves its structure and topology while preventing oxidation, enabling ex&#8208;situ experiments and advancing the fabrication of bismuthene&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two&#8208;third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene, this barrier is successfully overcome. As demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. Hereby, hydrogen is identified as the critical process gas that was&#160;missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. These findings facilitate ex&#8208;situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next&#8208;generation&#160;technologies.

         <title>3D Printing of Auxetic Self&#8208;powered Mechanoluminescent Photonic Skins for Underwater Communication and Safety Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic mechanoluminescent photonic skin for underwater communication and safety monitoring is introduced. Its auxetic structures, with a negative Poisson's ratio, ensure exceptional conformability to curved surfaces, enhancing adaptability to dynamic underwater environments. Encapsulated in silicone, it offers outstanding stretchability, brightness, and durability even in harsh conditions, enabling reliable deep&#8208;sea exploration.








Abstract
Stretchable mechanoluminescent (ML) photonic skin with strong and stable brightness holds great promise for underwater communication and safety monitoring. However, traditional film&#8208;based ML devices often lack the compliance needed to accommodate curved surfaces and face a trade&#8208;off between extensibility and luminescent intensity. This study introduces a 3D&#8208;printed self&#8208;powered auxetic ML photonic skin. By utilizing auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, we created a stretchable ML device that conforms to complex, curved surfaces, enhancing its applicability in dynamic underwater settings. By encapsulating the auxetic ML structure in silicone, simultaneous improvements in brightness uniformity and stretchability are achieved. The device exhibits remarkable durability, maintaining consistent light emission and mechanical performance over 10&#8201;000 cycles, and demonstrates the potential for real&#8208;time underwater communication and safety monitoring. Integrated into a glove, a swimming toy, and a gas tank, the photonic skin successfully transmitted Morse code signals and detected gas leaks, showcasing its versatility and robustness in harsh underwater conditions. These findings underscore the potential of this technology to improve safety and efficiency in marine exploration, paving the way for further advancements in underwater robotics and communication.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Sn on Core&#8208;Shell MoS2 Nanoreactors as Mott&#8208;Schottky Phase Junctions for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow core&#8208;shell structured Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor with a definite Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif is designed, which exhibits a record overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction promotes charge transfer, while the surface Sn single atom facilitates the reduction of adsorbed H&#8314;, thus accelerating the catalytic performance.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a pivotal role in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, traditional HER catalysts still face significant challenges, including limited activity, poor acid resistance, and high costs. To address these issues, a hollow core&#8208;shell structured 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor is designed for acidic HER, where Sn single atoms are anchored on the shell of 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 catalyst demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 16.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in acidic media&#8212;the best performance reported to date among MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the internal electric field at the Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction, which facilitates efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the Sn single atoms modulate the electronic structure of Mo atoms within the Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif, inducing a significant shift in the d&#8208;band center and thereby optimizing the dehydrogenation process. This work presents a novel electrocatalyst design strategy that simultaneously engineers interfacial charge transfer and surface catalysis, offering a promising approach for advancing energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Directionally Modulated Zinc Deposition by a Robust Zincophilic Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine Protective Layer in Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the precisely anchored zincophilic sites, the ample transport channels with rich redox active sites, and the suppressed hydrogen evolution by the copper (Cu) sites, a highly conjugated robust Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine covalent organic framework layer is designed and applied for directional modulation of zinc (Zn) ions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The directional modulation of zinc (Zn) deposition with further investigation of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective layer for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a robust metalated covalent organic framework (CuPc&#8208;COF) used as the artificial anode protective layer is proposed, in which the zincophilic sites of &#960;&#8208;conjugated periodic skeletons are precisely designed to modulate the directional migration of Zn2+, the multiple redox&#8208;active sites facilitate the Zn2+ confinement and transfer, and the central metal copper (Cu)&#160;serves as the inhibitor to eliminate the hydrogen evolution side reactions. By combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar CuPc&#8208;COF layer is a desired protective coating of AZIB anodes with directionally transport channels and abundant redox active sites, thus inducing two&#8208;dimensional deposition of Zn. Attributed to these superiorities, the fabricated CuPc&#8208;COF@Zn anode demonstrates excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetrical cell (exceeding 2500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and full cell with different cathodes (more than 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), outperforming most reported zinc anodes with COF&#8208;based layers.

         <title>Neuroblastoma&#8208;Targeting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated COP Nanostructure with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Actions for Sonochemodynamic Immunotherapies</title>

         <dc:description>
An imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. The COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment, leveraging ultrasound to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, a major challenge in SDT is the efficiency of ROS generation, particularly in the context of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, inspired by the natural peroxidase, an imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) has been designed with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. This work demonstrates that COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity. Notably, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure endows COPTPcFe with excellent electron transport capabilities, enabling rapid catalysis of H2O2 to O2, thus alleviating the hypoxic conditions within tumors. Moreover, by encapsulating COPTPcFe with neuroblastoma cell membranes, this study achieveshomologous targeting of tumor cells and tissues, leading to efficient accumulation within tumor cells, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis. Additionally, the proposed sonochemodynamic immunotherapy effectively activates natural killer cells and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of neuroblastoma treatment.

         <title>Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells Approaching 20.4% Efficiency via Active Layer Pre&#8208;Solidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique active layer pre&#8208;solidification strategy is proposed to suppress the excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation, which effectively mitigates the efficiency drops caused by various green solvents, demonstrating the excellent universality. Additionally, by suppressing the coffee&#8208;ring effect, the rigid and flexible OSC modules achieve record&#8208;breaking PCEs of 17.06% and 12.45%, respectively, exhibiting the excellent scalability.








Abstract
Green solvent fabrication of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) is essential for their industrial scale extension and ecological sustainability, but there is typically an obvious efficiency drop during the transition from halogenated to green solvents due to the severe molecular aggregation. Here, an innovative strategy of active layer pre&#8208;solidification by liquid nitrogen freezing process is proposed to accelerate molecular precipitation and crystallization, and therefore suppress the excessive phase separation, as demonstrated by PiFM and GISAXs results. Moreover, pre&#8208;solidification process allows more solvents to carry acceptor molecules for an orderly upward migration during rapid volatilization, facilitating an ideal longitudinal gradient arrangement of photovoltaic materials that is favorable for charge transport and extraction. Consequently, PM6:L8BO&#8208;X:BO&#8208;8F OSCs fabricate with o&#8208;xylene yielded a record efficiency of 20.38%, which is comparable to 20.56% for chloroform&#8208;processed devices. The inconspicuous efficiency gaps are observed in various photovoltaic materials by using green solvents, proving the outstanding universality. In addition, the pre&#8208;solidification process effectively inhibits the coffee&#8208;ring effect in large&#8208;area active layer films and boosts the OSC modules to an exciting 17.06% efficiency. This work virtually eliminates the photovoltaic performance losses caused by green solvents, and charts a sustainable avenue to large&#8208;scale commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Amorphous Phosphates Tailor Local Proton Supply for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A balanced proton supply improves electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance without causing proton aggregation or electron wastage. This is made by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrode design, where the key feature is a multi&#8208;role proton&#8208;managing amorphous phosphate species that facilitates active hydrogen/proton generation, buffers excess protons without local pile&#8208;up, and transfers protons to H&#8208;consuming CoP rapidly.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is irreplaceable as a feedstock in varied industrial scenarios, and alkaline water electrolysis allows for H2 production without costly proton exchange membrane and noble metals with limited reserves. However, alkaline solution is devoid of directly available protons, leading to suboptimal electrochemical H2&#8208;evolving kinetics even on catalysts with high intrinsic activities like CoP. On the other hand, high local acidity (i.e., superfluous protons) can lead to undesirable catalyst corrosion and active site blocking by excessive hydrogen coverage. Herein, a &#8220;cobalt phosphate&#8208;clothed&#8208;CoP (CoPi@CoP)&#8221; nanoarray catalyst is developed for proof of concept to explore a possible proton supply design principle. The nanometer&#8208;thick amorphous CoPi appears to serve multiple functions: facilitating water dissociation/H&#8211;O cleavage, buffering excess protons, and accelerating proton transfer/donation, thus optimizing the local proton supply to H&#8208;consuming sites. As expected, CoPi@CoP demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes, surpassing that of intrinsically active CoP. Online differential mass spectrometry, dynamic potential decay transients, spectroscopy data, and theoretical calculations reveal possible (atomic scale) reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Intensive Widmannst&#228;tten Nanoprecipitates Catalyze SnTe With State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intensive lath&#8208;shaped Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates are in situ generated in SnTe via AgPbSbTe3 alloying, and align with the formation of the parallel type and twin type interfaces. These Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a significantly enhanced average ZT, more suitable for mid&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Nanoprecipitates play a vital role in designing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, particularly for those with short phonon mean&#8208;free paths. However, their effectiveness in reducing lattice thermal conductivity is hindered by the uncontrollable intensity, poor interfacial coherence, and suboptimal morphology. To address these limitations, AgPbSbTe3 is used to alloy SnTe to form intensive Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermoelectric performance. Advanced microscopy characterizations reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between SnTe and Ag2Te to guide the lath&#8208;shaped morphology of Ag2Te, leading to the formation of the high&#8208;intensity Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates, which effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Togethering the optimized electrical properties through carrier concentration adjustment, band convergence, and the energy filtering effect, a maximum figure of merit ZT of 1.5 at 723 K and an average ZT of 1.1 between 423 and 823 K is achieved in (SnTe)0.80(Ag1.05PbSb0.95Te3)0.20, enabling a single&#8208;leg device and two&#8208;pair module with energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 4.26% under a temperature difference of 450 K, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of intensive Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates as effective phonon scattering centers, providing a new pathway to enhance the thermoelectric performance of chalcogenides.

&lt;p&gt;The intensive lath-shaped Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates are in situ generated in SnTe via AgPbSbTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloying, and align with the formation of the parallel type and twin type interfaces. These Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a significantly enhanced average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;, more suitable for mid-temperature applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoprecipitates play a vital role in designing high-performance thermoelectric materials, particularly for those with short phonon mean-free paths. However, their effectiveness in reducing lattice thermal conductivity is hindered by the uncontrollable intensity, poor interfacial coherence, and suboptimal morphology. To address these limitations, AgPbSbTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is used to alloy SnTe to form intensive Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates for obtaining state-of-the-art thermoelectric performance. Advanced microscopy characterizations reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between SnTe and Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te to guide the lath-shaped morphology of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, leading to the formation of the high-intensity Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates, which effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Togethering the optimized electrical properties through carrier concentration adjustment, band convergence, and the energy filtering effect, a maximum figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.5 at 723 K and an average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.1 between 423 and 823 K is achieved in (SnTe)&lt;sub&gt;0.80&lt;/sub&gt;(Ag&lt;sub&gt;1.05&lt;/sub&gt;PbSb&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling a single-leg device and two-pair module with energy-conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 4.26% under a temperature difference of 450 K, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of intensive Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates as effective phonon scattering centers, providing a new pathway to enhance the thermoelectric performance of chalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Ion Migration Suppression Strategy Based on Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional layers are stabilized by the simultaneous suppression of the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules (C8A). The C8A&#8208;doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a PCE of 26.01% (certified 25.68%). The C8A&#8208;modified p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%). The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015 h of continuous operation at maximum power point.








Abstract
The migration of multiple chemical species is are main factor leading to the intrinsic instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a universal ion migration suppression strategy is innovatively reported to stabilize multiple functional layers by simultaneously suppressing the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules. After incorporating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[8]arene (C8A), the interfacial defects are passivated, suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the p&#8208;doping of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is facilitated, and the extraction and transport of holes are promoted for n&#8208;i&#8208;p regular PSCs. The C8A doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% (certified 25.68%), which is the record PCE ever reported for the TiO2&#8208;based planar PSCs. The C8A passivated p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%), which is the highest PCE for the PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation method. The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015&#160;h of continuous operation at maximum power point. This work provides a feasible and effective avenue to address the intrinsic instability of perovskite&#8208;based photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Suppressing Interlayer Ion Migration in CsPbX3 Nanocrystal Films for Realizing Efficient and Stable Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface is fabricated through transfer printing to decouple the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs. Halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface cause phase separation and poor device stability, while confined halogen ions in a single nanocrystal negligibly influence the spectral stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face the critical challenge of field&#8208;dependent phase separation. Discrete colloidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals anchored with ligands are promising to suppress phase separation, yet it remains a mystery how ion migration proceeds when integrated into LEDs as emissive films. Specifically, the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across the nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs needs to be decoupled. Here, a low&#8208;temperature&#8208;assisted transfer&#8208;printing method is developed to construct a model PeLED containing a clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface for tracing the ion migration between perovskite nanocrystal films along the direction of electric fields. The comprehensive study demonstrates that halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface lead to severe phase separation and poor device stability, rather than the horizontal intra&#8208;layer diffusion. The monolayer CsPbX3 nanocrystal film prevents the field&#8208;dependent phase separation caused by interlayer ion migration, significantly improving electroluminescent stability, including spectrum and lifetime. The optimized structure achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9% and a remarkably improved operational half&#8208;lifetime of 61.2 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&#8722;2 in pure&#8208;red PeLEDs based on mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Ix/Br1&#8208;x)3, more than 300 times longer than the control device using multilayer nanocrystals.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a scalable method for synthesizing ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich nanosheets, utilizing graphene oxide (GO) as a structure&#8208;directing agent. The approach achieves kilogram&#8208;scale production with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield and demonstrates universality across various ligands. The optimized nanosheets exhibit superior electrochemical performance in aqueous basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
The scalable preparation of 2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets remains a significant challenge due to low stripping efficiency and susceptibility to agglomeration. Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D ultrathin single&#8208;crystal MOF/graphene oxide (GO)/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets based on the Ni/Co&#8208;BDC MOF (BDC = 1,4&#8208;terephthalic acid), with GO serving as a structure&#8208;directing agent. Impressively, 1&#160;kg of MGM nanosheets can be obtained in a single batch with a metal&#8208;based yield of 98.73%. Furthermore, the universality of this strategy is implemented by the successful synthesis of three additional 2D ultrathin nanosheets: MGM7&#8208;ABDC, MGM7&#8208;FBDC, and MGM7&#8208;BPDC (metal = Ni, Co; ligands = 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid (2&#8208;ABDC), 2&#8208;fluoroterephthalic acid (2&#8208;FBDC), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208; biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BPDC)). The as&#8208;prepared MGM7 nanosheets (Ni: Co ratio = 7:3) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode for aqueous basic zinc battery (159.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), anode for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB, 593.0&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), and electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 224&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), significantly outperforming both bulk MOFs and conventional MOF nanosheets. This work enables the scalable synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with enhanced properties for multiple applications.

         <title>Finding a Novel Borate Ferroelectric with Random Domain Structures for Deep&#8208;UV Quasi&#8208;Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric material, Ba&#8323;Mg&#8323;(BO&#8323;)&#8323;F&#8323; (BMBF) is presented, whose randomly distributed nanoscale domain structures could relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, the BMBF crystal achieves 3.55 &#181;J output energy for 398 &#8594; 199 nm wavelength frequency conversion without requiring birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions.








Abstract
Finding competitive nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for practical deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) lasers remains a fundamental yet challenging goal in photonic materials research. The production of deep&#8208;UV lasers through the mesoscopic domain structure of ferroelectric materials has been a popular research area via quasi&#8208;phase&#8208;matching (QPM). However, as of right present, no ferroelectric in the deep&#8208;UV area is able to provide QPM laser output. Here, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric Ba3Mg3(BO3)3F3 (BMBF) is presented. The ferroelectricity of BMBF crystals exhibits significant relaxor behavior and the random domain structure can relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions, rendering it a disordered NLO medium. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, BMBF crystal achieves a second&#8208;harmonic generation output energy of 3.55 &#181;J for 398 to 199&#160;nm wavelength frequency conversion, even in the absence of birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions. This result demonstrates that BMBF is a promising candidate for deep&#8208;UV QPM applications. Furthermore, this study expands the frontiers of borate ferroelectrics while the realization of deep&#8208;UV light output using BMBF crystal motivates and provides a path for its broader application.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ga2O3 In&#8208;Memory DUV Photodetectors By Interface Charge Reservoir Design for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. The device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance. Further, the potential of the device in weak&#8208;light imaging enhancement, light information storage, and light moving path recording in the passive mode is excavated for the first time.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance detectors has played a key role in the innovation of modern optoelectronics. However, the implementation of high&#8208;performance detectors has been a huge challenge, especially the present detectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunction required in single devices. Here, it is demonstrated a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. Originating from the dynamic control of the channel carriers by the interface charge reservoir under illumination and electrical, the device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance. The ultrahigh&#8208;speed programming/erasing operations in the range of nanoseconds with an extinction ratio up to 109 is achieved. Moreover, the in&#8208;memory photodetectors achieve near&#8208;zero dark current, record high responsivity (6.7 &#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1), and sensitivity for UV light, making them the most sensitive UV photodetectors. Further, the potential of the device in weak&#8208;light imaging enhancement, light information storage, and light moving path recording in the passive mode is excavated for the first time. This work enables new device capabilities and opens new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance in&#8208;memory detectors.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted CVD Growth of High&#8208;Quality Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to in situ grow twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The fraction of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) is significantly improved to 9.15%. The clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility exceeding 20&#8201;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) garners significant interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulator behavior. However, challenges persist in preparing high&#8208;quality tBLG with clean interfaces and a broad range of twist angles. Herein, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is presented that utilizes an oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy to grow high&#8208;quality tBLG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The continuous and stable oxygen supply not only facilitates rapid graphene growth, but also overcomes the self&#8208;limiting growth of monolayer graphene on liquid Cu. Consequently, the growth rate of tBLG reaches a record of 450&#160;&#181;m&#160;h&#8722;1, with 86.9% of the tBLG grown with the assistance of the oxide substrate. The proportion of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) improves to &#8776;9.15%, one of the highest percentages for CVD&#8208;grown tBLG within this range. Density functional theory calculations explain in detail the assisted effect of oxygen on the rapid growth and twist angle distribution of tBLG. Furthermore, the presence of a clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility of 20&#8201;616 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG. The research offers a new and feasible way of growing tBLG.

         <title>Rational Development of a Novel Emulgel Adjuvant for Single&#8208;Shot Effective Vaccination: A Multivariate Analysis Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multivariate analysis, a novel emulgel adjuvant is developed by combining key nanoemulsion formulation variables&#8211;hydrogel trapping, small globule size, and mannide monooleate surfactant&#8211;achieving 10&#215; greater immunogenicity than MF59 in mice after a single shot. The emulgel matched Freund's adjuvant in immunogenicity and efficacy, ensured safety, and offers promise for single&#8208;dose vaccines, advancing adjuvant design and pandemic preparedness.








Abstract
Nanoemulsions, like MF59, are potent vaccine adjuvants due to their immunogenicity, scalability, stability, and generation of broad cross&#8208;clade neutralizing immune responses, facilitating their feasibility for pandemic preparedness. However, they are unsuitable for single&#8208;shot applications due to limited immunogenicity with subunit antigens, and need to be explored for key immunogenic formulation variables like surfactant type, antigen anchoring, oil&#8208;globule solidification, hydrogel polymer trapping, or globule size. Here, a multivariate analysis approach is used for the first time in adjuvant development, selecting 14 formulations from over 150, each with a unique formulation variable, to evaluate their immunological properties on C57BL/6 mice. Results show that nanoemulsions with hydrogel trapping, smaller globule size, or mannide monooleate cosurfactant significantly enhance immunogenicity, each by 5&#8208;to&#8208;10 folds over MF59. For the first time, these formulation variables are combined into an &#8220;optimized emulgel&#8221; that is predicted to maximize immunogenicity after a single shot, model fit gave (R2 = 0.97). The optimized emulgel triggers long&#8208;lasting immune responses matching both the model's prediction and those triggered by the gold&#8208;standard Freund's adjuvant against various antigens, while maintaining excellent safety. The findings highlight the potential of emulgels as a novel adjuvant class and underscore the utility of multivariate analysis in adjuvant design.

         <title>2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse Realizing In&#8208;Sensor Intensity&#8208;Spanning Visual Feature Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D TSAS that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion is presented, enabled by combined in&#8208;plane anisotropy and time&#8208;stretching photoresponse of 2D NbOI2. Leveraging these properties, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains has been constructed, achieving accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, offering a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.








Abstract
High&#8208;dynamic&#8208;range (HDR) visual environments, where extremely bright and dark regions coexist, pose major challenges for conventional imaging systems that rely on multi&#8208;frame exposure fusion and cloud&#8208;based post&#8208;processing. These approaches often suffer from high latency, limited efficiency, and privacy concerns, making them unsuitable for real&#8208;time or edge&#8208;level intelligent vision. Here, a 2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse (2D TSAS) is reported that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion from a single image frame. The 2D TSAS uniquely integrates two key features of NbOI2 material: in&#8208;plane anisotropy, which gives rise to polarization&#8208;resolved optical responses, and a time&#8208;stretching photoresponse arising from multi&#8208;channel transition&#8208;relaxation. This dual&#8208;mode mechanism enables direct encoding and temporal integration of spatial&#8208;polarization and luminance features during photoexcitation. Leveraging this behavior, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy is constructed for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains. The system achieves accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, reaching recognition accuracies of &#8776;95.41% on NWPU&#8208;RESISC45 and &#8776;95.39% on MNIST. This work offers a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.

         <title>Highly Exposed Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides with d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 33, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;engineering design of ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy sulfides (HES) in carbon nanofibers synergizes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and size effects, enabling efficient oxygen evolution with low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and ultrastable 300&#160;h operation. Electronic modulation via d&#8208;p orbital hybridization shifts the d&#8208;band center and redistributes interfacial charges, optimizing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates adsorption and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Precise regulation of electronic structure and nanoscale geometry represents a transformative strategy for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Here, highly exposed ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy sulfides (HES, 5.2&#160;nm) confined in porous carbon nanofibers are designed. This structure involves a dual&#8208;engineering synergistic effect combining d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and nanoconfinement. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal hybridization between transition metal 3d orbitals and sulfur 3p orbitals. This orbital interaction induces a d&#8208;band center shift toward the Fermi level and facilitates interfacial charge redistribution, endowing HES with superior electron&#8208;donating capability to accelerate proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics. Such electronic modulation significantly optimizes the adsorption of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates (*OH, *O, *OOH). Experimentally, the HES demonstrates exceptional OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 200&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability with negligible current decay during 300&#160;h operation across current densities ranging from 10 to 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a dual optimization strategy leveraging orbital hybridization engineering and size engineering for advanced electrocatalyst design, providing a new design approach in energy conversion technologies.

Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines
A single&#8208;injection platform for self&#8208;boosting vaccines is developed using a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery system. The platform enables pulsatile antigen release, protects pH&#8208;sensitive cargo, and elicits immune responses comparable to traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Machine learning enhances design by accurately predicting release profiles, offering a promising solution to improve global vaccine coverage and reduce under&#8208;immunization.

Fracture Healing
In a micromotion mechanical environment, the &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype while enhancing osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. More details can be found in article number 2505061 by Xiaochen Zhang, Shuogui Xu, Hao Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Topology in Biological Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the topological structures in biological piezoelectric materials, covering morphology evolution, spatial arrangement, and biomimetic strategies. These topologies modulate structure&#8208;property relationships across multiple scales, enabling performance enhancement and multifunctional integration. Insights into topology&#8208;guided optimization and growing applications in biosensing, health monitoring, energy harvesting, and disease treatment are provided, along with challenges for future research directions.








Abstract
Topology is fundamental in determining the properties and functions of biological piezoelectric materials by influencing service performances across multiple scales, from nanoscale molecular arrangements to macroscopic assembly structures. At each scale, topology governs electrical, mechanical, and biological behaviors, facilitating multifunctional integration and multi&#8208;field coupling advances. Recent progress demonstrates the potential of topological optimization to enhance piezoelectric coefficients and enable complex functionalities. Strategies such as multi&#8208;scale design, machine learning&#8208;guided optimization, and precision fabrication techniques are being explored to address persistent challenges, including limited energy conversion efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and biocompatibility. Critical applications include health monitoring, biosensing, energy harvesting, and disease treatment, highlighting opportunities and unresolved technical bottlenecks. Future research directions are discussed to present theoretical insights and practical pathways to the development of biological piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Healing Anode/Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, many researchers have attempted to develop ESAEIs or ISAEIs for stabilizing the Zn anode. ESAEIs can be divided into static ESAEIs and dynamic ESAEIs according to the evolution of ESAEIs during the cycling process, while ISAEIs include polymer&#8208;based ISAEIs and liquid metal&#8208;based ISAEIs according to the chemical composition.








Abstract
The rational design of Zn anode/electrolyte interphases (AEIs) is an effective strategy for regulating the Zn2+ stripping/plating process, as well as suppressing the interfacial side reactions. However, the formation of defects during the cycling process is still inevitable, and the exacerbation of defects would lead to the failure of the electrode, limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the Zn anode. In recent years, self&#8208;healing AEIs (SAEIs) have received great attention in Zn anode modification, as they can self&#8208;heal and suppress the defects. This review summarizes the latest progress of SAEIs for Zn anode, including extrinsic and intrinsic SAEIs. Specifically, the design strategies and self&#8208;healing mechanisms of SAEIs, their roles in stabilizing Zn anode, as well as the research methods for self&#8208;healing performance, are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges for the research of SAEIs are also analyzed, and prospects for the future design and research of SAEIs for Zn anode are provided. This review is expected to guide the future development of high&#8208;performance SAEIs for Zn and other metal anodes.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with the Upgrading of Organic and Inorganic Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the coupling of electrocatalytic H&#8322; production with the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals. The optimization synthesis strategy, catalytic activity, and structure&#8211;performance relationships of various electrocatalysts are summarized, and relevant catalytic reaction mechanisms and electrolytic cell configuration in practical application scenarios are discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are further proposed.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a green and sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity H2. However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four&#8208;electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy&#8208;saving H&#8322; production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure&#8211;performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Structural Regulation Methods and Quantum Chemistry for Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Advanced Oxidation Process: Critical Perspectives into Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide comprehensive molecular&#8208;level insights regarding catalytic oxidation mechanisms by carbon&#8208;based SACs, especially the coupling of the &#8220;oxidants&#8208;catalysts&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal molecular&#8208;level relationships. It is worth clarifying that all the molecular&#8208;level insights eventually are served for the development of scale&#8208;up engineering, which will satisfy the demand for actual wastewater.








Abstract
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra&#8208;effective and anti&#8208;interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro&#8208;level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular&#8208;oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the &#8220;oxidant&#8208;catalyst&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC&#8208;AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting&#8208;edge laboratory devices and pilot&#8208;scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs&#8208;AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large&#8208;scale potential of SACs&#8208;based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro&#8208;insights.

         <title>Empowering Generalist Material Intelligence with Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines how large language models drive the emergence of generalist materials intelligence by orchestrating data mining, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and autonomous experimentation. Through the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, LLMs actively unify materials ontology, simulation, synthesis, and characterization, enabling closed&#8208;loop, multimodal reasoning across the entire materials discovery cycle.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, where LLM&#8208;based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs&#8217; transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self&#8208;driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology&#8208;concept&#8208;computation&#8208;experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials&#8208;specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI.

     alt="Empowering Generalist Material Intelligence with Large Language Models"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review outlines how large language models drive the emergence of generalist materials intelligence by orchestrating data mining, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and autonomous experimentation. Through the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, LLMs actively unify materials ontology, simulation, synthesis, and characterization, enabling closed-loop, multimodal reasoning across the entire materials discovery cycle.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, where LLM-based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs&#8217; transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self-driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology-concept-computation-experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials-specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials-aware LLMs in real-world practices are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconducting Oligomer for Third Harmonic Generation Bioimaging of Ultradeep Brain Imaging with NIR&#8208;IIb Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With de novo design, semiconducting oligomers and their nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unexpectedly efficient Third harmonic generation (THG) performances with NIR&#8208;IIb excitation and anti&#8208;photobleaching capability. With these advantages, semiconducting oligomer NPs achieve high&#8208;resolution in vivo THG angiography of the deep brain at a record&#8208;high depth of 1745 &#181;m with spatial resolution and good biocompatibility, thus opening new horizons for developing high&#8208;performance THG probes.








Abstract
Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has unparalleled promise in high&#8208;spatiotemporal bioimaging within the tissue&#8208;transparent window of 1500 to 1700&#160;nm, commonly referred to as the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) region. However, so far, surprisingly few cases of non&#8208;fluorescent MPM probes have been&#160;reported, and their imaging performances are relatively limited. Herein, this study introduces a highly efficient third harmonic generation (THG) probe based on semiconducting oligomer derivatives (BTICs), which exhibit strong THG responses under NIR&#8208;IIb (1700&#160;nm) excitation. Leveraging halogen chemistry, semiconducting oligomers with varying halogen substitutions and nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;exhibit unexpectedly high THG performance across different aggregation states upon NIR&#8208;IIb excitation. The BTICs NPs exhibit a large THG conversion efficiency (1215&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;84 cm6 s2 photon&#8722;2) and exceptional resistance to photobleaching. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and in vivo THG angiography capabilities of BTICs NPs are validated, achieving the visualisation of deep&#8208;brain vasculature with unprecedented spatial resolution at a record&#8208;high imaging depth of 1745&#160;&#181;m. The pioneering exploitation of semiconducting oligomer&#8208;based THG probes establishes a new class of high&#8208;performance materials, enabling ultra&#8208;deep THG imaging of the&#160;brain and advancing the design of next&#8208;generation THG imaging platforms.

         <title>A Highly Adaptable Hydrogen Bond Re&#8208;Orientation (HyBRO) Strategy for Multiscale Vasculature Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy enables three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of vascular microchannel networks with high accuracy. By switching sacrificial material interactions with nonsolvents, HyBRO prevents swelling and deformation, enabling accurate hierarchical channels spanning a tenfold size range. The method accommodates diverse ink materials and produces vasculature exhibiting robust endothelial barrier function and ion&#8208;channel responses under shear stress.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional&#160;printing of microchannel networks mimicking native vasculature provides essential functions for biomedical applications. However, developing a highly &#8220;adaptable&#8221; technique &#8211; that can adjust to diverse materials choices, high shape accuracy, and broad size ranges &#8211; for producing physiologically responsive vasculature remains challenging. Here, an innovative hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy for microchannel network fabrication is reported. By identifying interfacial instability of sacrificial material (SM) during embedding as a core limitation, this strategy prints the SM into an optimal &#8220;nonsolvent&#8221; to shape the desirable channel structure. In this process, the nonsolvent instantaneously switches the SM from forming hydrogen bonds with exterior water to forming interior linkages inside it. This transition protects the SM from external solvent &#8220;erosion&#8221; upon re&#8208;exposure to embedding material, inhibiting deformation. Consequently, this approach enables the creation of accurate (&gt;90%), multiscale (10&#8208;fold), hierarchical microchannel networks, accommodating accurate printing of a wide range of ink materials &#8211; extending from typical hydrophilic polymers into non&#8208;typical hydrophobic ones. Further biological tests demonstrate that HyBRO&#8208;produced vasculature recapitulates not only essential endothelial barrier function but also delicate ion&#8208;channel responses to varying shear stresses, highlighting its potential for engineering physiologically responsive vasculature in broad applications.

         <title>Exceptional Thermal Conductivity in Printed Dielectrics through Compositional and Microstructural Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;generational compositional design creates a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promotes templated crystallization in a polymer matrix from surface&#8208;modified particles, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network.&#8221; The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals.








Abstract
As electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon&#8208;conducting ceramics offer a low&#8208;density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi&#8208;generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly&#8208;lactic acid &#160;matrix from surface&#8208;modified boron nitride platelets, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network&#8221;. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.

         <title>Superior Adhesion of Monolayer Amorphous Carbon to Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adhesion energy of monolayer amorphous carbon on copper substrate is 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, 13 times higher than that of graphene due to covalent&#8208;like bonding between the sp2 carbon structure to copper. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption (NEXAFS), and (density functional theory) DFT calculations are used to elucidate the structural and electronic interactions at the monolayer amorphous carbon&#8208;copper interface.









Abstract
The single&#8208;atom thickness of graphene holds great potential for device scaling, but its effectiveness as a thin metal&#8208;ion diffusion barrier in microelectronics and a corrosion barrier for plasmonic devices is compromised by weak van der Waals interactions with copper (Cu), leading to delamination issues. In contrast, monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), a recently reported single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick carbon film with a disordered sp2 hybridized structure, demonstrates superior adhesion properties. This study reveals that MAC exhibits an adhesion energy of 85&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 on Cu, which is 13 times greater than that of graphene. This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent&#8208;like Cu&#9472;C bonds while preserving its sp2 structure, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2pz orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz2 orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.

&lt;p&gt;The single-atom thickness of graphene holds great potential for device scaling, but its effectiveness as a thin metal-ion diffusion barrier in microelectronics and a corrosion barrier for plasmonic devices is compromised by weak van der Waals interactions with copper (Cu), leading to delamination issues. In contrast, monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), a recently reported single-atom-thick carbon film with a disordered sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized structure, demonstrates superior adhesion properties. This study reveals that MAC exhibits an adhesion energy of 85&#160;J&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Cu, which is 13 times greater than that of graphene. This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent-like Cu&#9472;C bonds while preserving its sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; structure, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inorganic Biomaterials Inducing Scaffolds Pre&#8208;Neuralization for Infarcted Myocardium Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that facilitates myocardial repair and improves cardiac function in vivo by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair.








Abstract
Neural networks are found to play an important role in monitoring and coordinating cardiac physiological activities. However, the clinical use of neuroregulatory strategies for repairing infarcted myocardium, such as vagus nerve stimulation and pharmacological activation, confronts the challenges of managing stimulation signals and potential drug side effects. In this study, an innovative myocardial infarction repair strategy by creating a &#8220;pre&#8208;neuralized&#8221; scaffold that combines strontium silicate microparticles with neural stem cells (NSCs) is introduced. Strontium silicate promotes NSCs&#160;differentiation, resulting in a scaffold enriched with mature neurons. This scaffold exhibits neuroregulatory capabilities that enhance the maturation and synchronized contraction of cardiomyocytes, facilitating myocardial repair and improving cardiac function in vivo. The findings indicate that the pre&#8208;neuralized scaffold aids myocardial recovery by modulating genes linked to circadian rhythm, underscoring the strategic benefit of neural&#8208;induced regulation in tissue repair. In conclusion, this study presents a promising approach to repairing infarcted myocardium using inorganic biomaterial&#8208;induced scaffolds with neuromodulatory properties from the perspective of systemically physiological regulation. This work may offer a new perspective for addressing complex tissue and organ injuries.

         <title>Noninvasive Optogenetics Realized by iPSC&#8208;Derived Tentacled Carrier in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling stem cell differentiation to produce functional vesicles offers a promising approach for novel delivery carriers. This study explores the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into &#8216;tentacled&#8217; stem cells, utilizing their derived &#8216;tentacled&#8217; vesicles as functional carriers to facilitate non&#8208;invasive, enhanced optogenetic therapy, offering a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;activated optogenetics technique contributing to the &#8220;restart&#8221; of degenerative neurons offers hope for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the limitations of persistent invasiveness and inadequate repair of the pathological environment strongly hinder its further application. Here, a concept of differentiating stem cells is proposed to produce functional materials to enhance the therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the &#8220;tentacled&#8221; stem cells TenSCs. Their &#8220;tentacled&#8221; vesicles TenSCev, upon inheriting the biological functions of the parent cell, will possess both neural targeting capacity and pathological environment repair ability. Hence, TenSCev are utilized as functional carrier to deliver optogenetics elements for completely non&#8208;traumatic and controllable neuron activation, while also facilitating the comprehensive restoration of the pathological environment, thus effectively halted disease progression and significantly improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease or aged mice. Further, the concept of generating specialized biomaterials from differentiated stem cells as functional carriers holds the potential to broaden the applicability of various neuroregulatory techniques in the treatment of neurological disorders.

         <title>Influence of Ion Size on Structure and Redox Chemistry in Na&#8208;Rich and Li&#8208;Rich Disordered Rocksalt Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger ion size of Na+ versus with Li+ has a pronounced impact on the intercalation chemistry of disordered rocksalt cathode materials. On charge, the disordered rocksalt structure is retained in Li2MnO2F but it is lost in Na2MnO2F resulting in extensive amorphization. The larger ion size also lowers the average voltage enabling higher capacities between equivalent voltage limits.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts are promising next&#8208;generation cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Recent reports have shown it is also possible to obtain Na&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts, however, it is currently poorly understood how the knowledge of the structural and redox chemistry translates from the Li&#8208;rich to the Na&#8208;rich analogs. Here, the properties of Li2MnO2F and Na2MnO2F are compared, which have different ion sizes (Li+ = 0.76 vs Na+ = 1.02 &#197;) but the same disordered rocksalt structure and stoichiometry. It is found that Na2MnO2F exhibits lower voltage Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox couples, opening access to a wider compositional range within the same voltage limits. Furthermore, the intercalation mechanism switches from predominantly single&#8208;phase solid solution behavior in Li2MnO2F to a two&#8208;phase transition in Na2MnO2F, accompanied by a greater decrease in the average Mn&#9472;O/F bond length. Li2MnO2F retains its long&#8208;range disordered rocksalt structure throughout the first cycle. In contrast, Na2MnO2F becomes completely amorphous during charge and develops a local structure characteristic of a post&#8208;spinel. This amorphization is partially reversible on discharge. The results show how the ion intercalation behavior of disordered rocksalts differs dramatically when changing from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;ions and offers routes to control the electrochemical properties of these high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and High Color Purity Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs Enabled by Linearly Fully Fused Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Design</title>

Solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs are achieved by designing a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type tetraborate emitter with intramoleuclar noncovalent interactions and highly distorted structure, since such emitter promots high color purity satisfying the BT.2020 standard and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. The nonsensitized solution&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.08.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large&#8208;scale production. However, solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, tBO&#8208;4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type molecular structure. tBO&#8208;4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1). The sensitizer&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED exploiting tBO&#8208;4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer&#8208;free vacuum&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQEmax of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll&#8208;off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF materials for solution&#8208; and vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large-scale production. However, solution-processable deep-blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitter, tBO-4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12-di-tert-butyl-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor-type molecular structure. tBO-4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet-triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The sensitizer-free solution-processed OLED exploiting tBO-4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer-free vacuum-processed deep-blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll-off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high-efficiency ultrapure deep-blue MR-TADF materials for solution- and vacuum-processed OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Transport and Carrier Polarity Tuning by Electrolyte Gating in Nickel Benzenehexathiol Coordination Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that charge transport in nickel benzenehexathiol coordination nanosheets is governed by variable&#8208;range hopping reflecting structural disorder. Electrolyte gating induces a switch in dominant carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type and leads to an improvement in thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets (CONASHs) or conjugated metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctive metal&#8208;organic bonding structures exhibit promise for electronics, sensing, and energy storage. Porous Nickel&#8208;Benzene hexathiol complex (Ni&#8208;BHT) with noteworthy conductivity was first reported a decade ago, and recent synthetic modifications produced non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT with enhanced conductivity (&#8776;50 S cm&#8722;1). Here the charge transport physics of such non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT films are studied with even higher conductivity (&#8776;112 S cm&#8722;1). In contrast to the thermally activated electrical conductivity, thermoelectric measurements suggest an intrinsic metallic nature of Ni&#8208;BHT. It is shown that it is possible to tune the Fermi level and carrier polarity in Ni&#8208;BHT by electrolyte gating; gating is initially governed by the formation of an interfacial, electric double layer and then evolves into an electrochemical (de)doping process. These findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of charge transport in CONASHs, but also show that Fermi level tuning is an effective approach for enhancing the thermoelectric performance of CONASHs.

         <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Metal Organic Framework Single Crystals by Kinetics&#8208;Mediated Micelle Assembly for Efficient Asymmetrical Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is established for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs (MesoMOFs) with diverse compositions and mesophases. The customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of a new class of mesoporous asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysts rich in catalytically accessible CoN3O sites, with enhanced localized electrons around Co center and upshifted d&#8208;band center, for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Constructing mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MesoMOFs) with customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment is pivotal for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis, yet it is impeded by the strong self&#8208;growth tendency of MOFs. In this work, a novel kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is introduced to realize the general fabrication of mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) single crystals. Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo&#8208;electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self&#8208;growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory&#8208;Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN3O single&#8208;atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d&#8208;band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in a zinc&#8208;air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Gated Organic Phototransistors for Efficient UV/DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dual&#8208;function dielectric and photoresponsive layers are introduced. By decoupling photoresponse and charge transport, the PGPTs achieve exceptional UV/DUV detection performance at low operating voltages, with scalability and material flexibility. This innovative approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, versatile platform for advanced photodetectors, enabling applications in telecommunications, imaging, and solar&#8208;blind detection.








Abstract
Conventional UV/DUV phototransistors, which rely on wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor channels, encounter issues with material availability, processing complexity, and performance tunability. Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) are introduced that decouple photoresponse and charge transport by using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dielectric layers and non&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors as channels. This design offers material flexibility, simplified processing, and enhanced performance. Using the 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite PEA2PbBr4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.0&#160;eV) as the dielectric layer and the organic semiconductor (OSC) P3HT as the channel layer, UV phototransistors are successfully achieved with exceptional photodetection performance at operating voltages below 2&#160;V, exhibiting a responsivity of 1960&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, a specific detectivity of 3&#160; &#215; &#160;1011 Jones, and a response time of &#8776;20&#160;ms. Fabricated via low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C) solution processing, this approach facilitates scalable production and is adaptable to various OSCs and other wide&#8208;bandgap MHP dielectrics, such as PEA2PbCl4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.6&#160;eV) and PEA2SnI4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;eV), extending their potential for DUV detection. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical decoder for telecommunications is demonstrated using DUV PEA2PbCl4/PDVT&#8208;10 PGPTs, which are immune to ambient light interference. Additionally, these DUV phototransistors show potential for latent fingerprint detection due to their sensitivity to skin absorption characteristics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Electric Control of Ferromagnetism in Van Der Waals Multiferroic Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first demonstration of the nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization modulation of magnetic domains in van der Waals multiferroic Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 heterostructures at ambient conditions, which is primarily attributed to the ferroelectric polarization&#8208;controlled Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Multiferroic heterostructures offer a promising platform for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power spintronic devices by enabling electric&#8208;field control of magnetism. While recent advances in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe3GaTe2/CuInP2S6 multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions. The modulation is evidenced macroscopically by reshaped magnetic hysteresis loops in anomalous Hall voltage measurements and microscopically by in situ magnetic and electric field&#8208;induced domain evolution captured via magnetic force microscopy. The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the polarization of CuInP2S6 induces a significant modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) in Fe3GaTe2. Incorporating these effects into micromagnetic simulations reproduces key features of the experimental hysteresis behaviors, indicating that the polarization&#8208;enhanced DMI lowers domain wall formation energy and drives a transition from coherent to incoherent magnetic reversal.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents the first demonstration of the nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization modulation of magnetic domains in van der Waals multiferroic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures at ambient conditions, which is primarily attributed to the ferroelectric polarization-controlled Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiferroic heterostructures offer a promising platform for next-generation low-power spintronic devices by enabling electric-field control of magnetism. While recent advances in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic and ferroelectric materials have sparked significant interest, achieving reliable and nonvolatile electrical modulation of magnetism at room temperature within vdW multiferroic heterostructures remains a substantial challenge. Here, this study demonstrates robust, reproducible, and nonvolatile electrical control of ferromagnetism in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; multiferroic heterostructures under ambient conditions. The modulation is evidenced macroscopically by reshaped magnetic hysteresis loops in anomalous Hall voltage measurements and microscopically by in situ magnetic and electric field-induced domain evolution captured via magnetic force microscopy. The first-principles calculations reveal that the polarization of CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; induces a significant modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Incorporating these effects into micromagnetic simulations reproduces key features of the experimental hysteresis behaviors, indicating that the polarization-enhanced DMI lowers domain wall formation energy and drives a transition from coherent to incoherent magnetic reversal. These findings not only surmount the challenge of electrically modulating ferromagnetism in vdW systems via remanent ferroelectric polarization at room temperature but also open new pathways for energy-efficient skyrmion manipulation and vdW spintronic device engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Nonfouling and Cell&#8208;Binding Polysulfobetaine Inducing Fast Transcytosis for Tumor&#8208;Active Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>

Modulation of the N&#8208;alkyl chain length in polysulfobetaine&#8208;based zwitterionic micelles enables precise tuning of nanocarrier interactions with proteins and cell membranes. The optimized micelles comprising&#160;poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) with N&#8208;butyl substituent (PSB4&#8208;PCL), which are protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;philic, achieve a unique balance between prolonged circulation and efficient tumor transcytosis, leading to enhanced intratumoral accumulation, deep penetration, and potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake are essential yet paradoxical requirements for efficient tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery carriers. For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long&#8208;circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell&#8208;membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N&#8208;alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N&#8208;alkyl chain became cell membrane&#8208;philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)&#8208;loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor&#8208;active drug delivery carriers.

         <title>Atomistic Mechanisms of the Crystallographic Orientation&#8208;Dependent Cu1.8S Conductive Channel Formation in Cu2S&#8208;Based Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compliance current can be utilized to control the volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching behaviors of &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, which results from the &#947;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase transition and orientation&#8208;dependent formation (along &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201]) of high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S conductive channels, respectively. The Cu1.8S channels form from an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase through the directional Cu+ migration along &#948;&#8208;Cu2S [001].








Abstract
Achieving multiple types of resistive switching in a single material with controlled ionic motion is a key challenge in neuromorphic computing, traditionally addressed by combining materials with distinct switching behaviors. Here, Cu2&#8208;xS is identified as a promising candidate to overcome this limitation due to its hierarchical phase transitions. Using in situ biasing experiments, reversible and non&#8208;reversible phase transitions (and resistive switching) are demonstrated in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S by controlling the compliance current. The formation of parallel high&#8208;digenite Cu1.8S channels, orientated along the &#947;&#8208;Cu2S [201] crystallographic direction, drives the nonvolatile resistive switching. These channels emerge via an intermediate &#948;&#8208;Cu2S phase and are stabilized at room temperature by residual strains, alongside &#946;&#8208;Cu2S phase. The work clarifies the complex, electrically triggered phase transformations in &#947;&#8208;Cu2S, and highlights the potential of Cu2&#8208;xS as a versatile material for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Flexible Selenium Nanowires with Tuneable Electronic Bandgaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotubes serve as effective test tubes for selenium nanowires, as their diameter precisely controls the width of the nanowires and the Se&#9472;Se bonding, resulting in a variety of different structures. An electron beam can be used to modify the nanotubes, allowing real&#8208;time observation of the nanowire extrusion process. Additionally, optically transparent boron nitride nanotubes enable direct bandgap measurements for individual nanowires, revealing the interplay between various phenomena occurring at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Manipulating semiconductor properties without altering their chemical composition holds promise for electronic and optical materials. However, linking atomic positions in nanomaterials to their functional properties is challenging due to their polydispersity. This study utilizes nano test tubes to uncover distinct phases of selenium, an elemental semiconductor, demonstrating a remarkable structural plasticity between 0.4 and 3.0 nm. These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra&#8208;low&#8208;loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non&#8208;monotonic on the host&#8208;nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub&#8208;nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real&#8208;time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter. These nanoscale findings pave the way for the development of advanced miniature tuneable and flexible electronic components, including transistors, optical sensors, and photovoltaics.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress&#8208;Specific Nanoinducer Selectively Evokes Type&#8208;II Immunogenic Cell Death for Pyroptotic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a pH/cathepsin dual&#8208;gated nanoplatform (PCANER) enabling tumor&#8208;responsive, precise endoplasmic reticulum (ER) delivery of photosensitizers to induce type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death and pyroptosis. With 83% ER&#8208;targeted efficacy, PCANER promotes glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78/calreticulin exposure and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, establishing a subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted immunomodulation paradigm for cancer therapy.








Abstract
Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress&#8208;initiated type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type&#8208;II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin&#8208;Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo&#8208;induce ER stress (PCANER) and type&#8208;II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCANER integrates the long&#8208;circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual&#8208;gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCANER augments type&#8208;II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade&#8208;amplify the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, while the mild type&#8208;I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCANLy) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a pH/cathepsin dual-gated nanoplatform (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt;) enabling tumor-responsive, precise endoplasmic reticulum (ER) delivery of photosensitizers to induce type-II immunogenic cell death and pyroptosis. With 83% ER-targeted efficacy, PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; promotes glucose-regulated protein 78/calreticulin exposure and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, establishing a subcellular organelle-targeted immunomodulation paradigm for cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-initiated type-II immunogenic cell death (ICD) shows great potential in boosting tumor immunogenicity and anti-tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to selectively provoke type-II ICD, due to the lack of highly efficient ER targeting strategy. Here, a pH/Cathepsin-Activatable Nanoplatform (PCAN) is reported to specifically photo-induce ER stress (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt;) and type-II ICD for cancer immunotherapy. PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; integrates the long-circulating properties of nanomedicines with pH/cathepsin B dual-gated design, exhibiting excellent ER targeting with a colocalization efficacy of 83% in cancer tissues. Through directly intensifying glucose-regulated protein 78 and calreticulin exposure, PCAN&lt;sup&gt;ER&lt;/sup&gt; augments type-II ICD and pyroptotic cancer cell death with high immune priming to cascade-amplify the cancer-immunity cycle, while the mild type-I ICD induced by lysosome stress (PCAN&lt;sup&gt;Ly&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibits negligible antitumor efficacy. By leveraging the spatiotemporal subcellular organelle targeting of PCAN technology, this study achieves precise tuning of the type of ICD and cellular pyroptosis-based cancer therapy. This study offers new insights into the design of organelle level-targeted nanomedicines, paving the way for dissecting and modulating the cell death mechanism to boost cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Kagome Metallic Composite Realizes Mechanically Axial Zero Thermal Expansion up to 800 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kagome metallic composite is used to prepare high&#8208;strength two&#8208;phase zero thermal expansion alloys. By in situ precipitation of the plastic &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase yields zero thermal expansion alloys with ultra&#8208;wide temperature windows and excellent compressive strength. This method can be extended to other Fe&#8208;based negative thermal expansion systems for high performance in the future.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome&#8208;lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Co ternary alloys prepared by two&#8208;step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra&#8208;wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (&#945;l = +0.98 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1, 110&#8211;800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11&#160;GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function.

         <title>Engineering Cellular Self&#8208;Adhesions Inside 3D Printed Micro&#8208;Arches to Enhance Cell:Biomaterial Attachment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly, a cell can bind to itself to make a self&#8208;adhesion, which engineered here to improve how cells attach to biomaterials. Nanoprinting are used to make 3D structures smaller than cells&#8211;called Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnels (SATs)&#8211;around which cells can wrap and bind to themselves. These self&#8208;adhesions improve cell attachment stability and offer a new approach for biomaterial design.








Abstract
A cell can bind to itself and form a self&#8208;adhesion that can be engineered and harnessed as a new way to adhere cells to engineered materials&#8211;a key challenge for biomaterials are demonstrated. Here, a 3D structure smaller is developed than a single cell, that a Self&#8208;Adhesion&#8208;Tunnel (SAT) is called, that causes cells to wrap around it and bind to themselves. This process is driven through the cadherin proteins that regulate cell&#8208;cell adhesion, and it is shown that many of the key elements of a normal cell&#8208;cell adhesion are found in self&#8208;adhesions. Size and shape of the SAT determine the efficiency of&#160;self&#8208;adhesion&#160;formation, and &gt;90% efficient formation of self&#8208;adhesions are observed in both kidney and skin cells per SAT. Self&#8208;adhesions can persist for at least 24&#160;hrs and act to stabilize the cell&#8208;material interface and reduce migration. Overall, this ability to co&#8208;opt the native cell&#8208;cell adhesion machinery in cells and use it as an attachment strategy can provide new approaches for soft&#8208;tissue implant integration and tissue engineering scaffolds where stable tissue&#8208;material interfaces are critical.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Agent&#8208;Network&#8208;Based Idea Generator for Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Electrolyte Discovery: A Case Study on Zinc Tetrafluoroborate Hydrate&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes</title>

         <dc:description>
An LLM&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network screens academic literature to propose multiple environmentally friendly aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Experiments identify an optimal composition of Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O and ethylene carbonate, which shows high conductivity and cycling stability. Spectroscopy and simulations confirm corrosion suppression and stable solid electrolyte interphases, establishing an AI&#8208;driven paradigm for electrolyte discovery.








Abstract
Aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer great potential for low&#8208;cost zinc&#8208;ion batteries but often have limited performance. Discovering new electrolytes is therefore crucial, yet time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive. In response, this work presents a Large Language Model (LLM)&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network that proposes DEE compositions for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37&#160;V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g&#8722;1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion, while a fluorine&#8208;rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability. This work showcases a pioneering LLM&#8208;driven approach to electrolyte development, establishing a new paradigm in materials research.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal Tolerance for Bright and Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers developed ultra&#8208;stable near&#8208;infrared perovskite LEDs with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% from 70 to 1200 mA cm&#8722;2, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, these PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability at high current densities. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&gt;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Here, near&#8208;infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (T50) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350&#160;h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving efficient and stable PeLEDs at high current densities, providing strategies for the development of high&#8208;power optoelectronic devices based on halide perovskites.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers developed ultra-stable near-infrared perovskite LEDs with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &amp;gt;20% from 70 to 1200 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in an ultra-high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, these PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability at high current densities. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite under elevated temperatures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&amp;gt;100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) remains a significant challenge. Here, near-infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &amp;gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in an ultra-high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350&#160;h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite under elevated temperatures. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving efficient and stable PeLEDs at high current densities, providing strategies for the development of high-power optoelectronic devices based on halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eliminating Positive Aging in Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by H2O&#8208;Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, could promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) usually exhibit a positive aging phenomenon with their efficiency and brightness increase after storage for several days. Although positive aging enhances device performance, its random and uncontrollable process presents substantial challenges for QLED industrialization. Here, It is identified that the H2O, produced by the reaction between the acidic resin and ZnMgO, can slowly passivate the defects of ZnMgO and is thus responsible for the positive aging. By intentionally introducing H2O to treat the ZnMgO and post&#8208;annealing the devices, the ZnMgO defects can be fully passivated soon after the devices are fabricated. As a result, the fresh devices exhibit a high efficiency of 55.2&#160;lm W&#8722;1 (26%), which is 2.04 (1.67)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices and 1.21 (1.02)&#8208;fold higher than those of untreated devices after positive aging. Moreover, the performance of the treated devices remains very stable even after storage for several days, indicating the undesired positive aging is completely eliminated. The developed in situ H2O treatment strategy, which enables the realization of high performance QLEDs and the elimination of uncontrollable positive aging, can promote the industrialization process of QLEDs.

         <title>Hybridizing Electrode Interface Structures in Protonic Ceramic Cells for Durable, Reversible Hydrogen and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>

A hybrid oxygen electrode combining PrOx nanoparticles with a PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone significantly boosts PCEC performance, achieving a current density of 2.25&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 1.30&#160;V in electrolysis mode and a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. This approach enhances catalytic activity and stability, advancing scalable solutions for clean energy conversion.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich praseodymium oxide (PrOx) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrOx introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d&#8208;band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm&#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 &#937; cm2). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

         <title>Interface Modification of Single Atom&#8208;Nanocluster Synergistic Sites to Break the Activity&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial modification strategy is introduced to precisely tailor the interface and electronic structure of palladium single atoms and clusters (Pd1+Pdn) synergistic sites. Catalytic experiments and spectroscopic characterization revealed site&#8208;specific adsorption&#8211;desorption behaviors and interface&#8208;enhanced H&#8208;spillover capacities on NC&#8208;modified Pd1+Pdn synergistic sites, thus achieving remarkable enhancements in activity, selectivity, and stability for selective hydrogenation reactions.








Abstract
Synergistic sites (M1+Mn) integrating single atoms (M1) and clusters (Mn) exhibit tremendous promise for overcoming linear scaling relationships. However, metal entities spatial segregation within synergistic sites impedes the overall optimization and structure&#8208;property analysis, and the support interface of the M1 and Mn sites critical for intermediate adsorption&#8208;transfer kinetics has yet unexplored. Here, for the first time, interfacial modification strategy is proposed to modulate the interface and electronic structure of M1+Mn sites. This is systematically altered that the interface of Pd1+Pdn sites from hydroxyapatite (HAP) to nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;modified HAP (NC/HAP) and pure NC, with all sites maintaining the comparable size and content. In the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes, volcano&#8208;type correlations between Pd1+Pdn sites with varying interfaces and hydrogenation activities are observed, peaking for those supported on NC/HAP. The obtained Pd1+Pdn@NC/HAP exhibits superior activity for alkynol&#8208;to&#8208;enol conversion, achieving a formation rate up to 3707.7&#160;mol molPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 while maintaining 97.2% selectivity. Comprehensive investigations propose d&#8208;band center of Pd1+Pdn sites with different interfaces as a descriptor to elucidate the volcano&#8208;type correlation for various selective hydrogenation reactions. Interfacial modification of Pd1+Pdn sites can optimize their electronic structure, adeptly managing substrates adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetic and interface H&#8208;spillover between segregated metal sites, thereby breaking &#8722;the activity&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

         <title>Highly Specific Cytokine Receptor&#8208;Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation and Sensitization of Osimertinib in EGFR&#8208;Mutated Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimeras (AP&#8208;CRTACs), which are constructed by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide, can specifically harness the scavenge receptor CXCR7 to direct membrane proteins of interest (POIs) to the lysosome for degradation, while eliminating the effects of CXCL12 on its another receptor CXCR4 activation and tumor cell viability.








Abstract
The ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell&#8208;proliferation&#8208;related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimera (AP&#8208;CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP&#8208;CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP&#8208;CRTAC constructed with a 2&#8242; F&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP&#8208;CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR&#8208;targeted therapies, to the third&#8208;generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects.

         <title>Atomic Scale Engineering of Multivalence&#8208;State Palladium Photocatalyst for Transfer Hydrogenation with Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation is achieved over a multivalence&#8208;state palladium photocatalyst, in which protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are added to unsaturated double bonds. The operando light&#8208;induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms the synergistic action between Pd single atoms and nanoparticles, in which the H&#8208; produced by palladium nanoparticles migrate to single atoms where the substrate is located, resulting in hydrogenation reaction.









Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but&#160;existing photocatalysts often suffer from&#160;modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co&#8208;activation, such as Mg&#8208;activated water or non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with&#160;ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon&#8208;nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox&#8208;flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.

         <title>Programmable Bacterial Architects Crafting Sonosensitizers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered bacterium SPEC5, designed via genetic circuit optimization and tumor cell membrane camouflage, functions as a live drug for efficient and precise tumor&#8208;selective sonosensitizer supply. SPEC5 colonizes tumor tissues, ensuring sustained 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) delivery into tumor cells, triggers in situ protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) biosynthesis, and enables effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach for precise SDT using living engineered bacterial therapeutics.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off&#8208;target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic&#8208;based Calibrated 5&#8208;ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non&#8208;pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5&#8208;ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoter regulating O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post&#8208;treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor&#8208;specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5&#8208;ALA&#8208;based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor&#8208;targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Natural van der Waals Canalization Lens for Non&#8208;Destructive Nanoelectronic Circuit Imaging and Inspection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Canalization&#8208;based super&#8208;resolution imaging has been achieved based on ultralow&#8208;loss and extremely anisotropic phonon polaritons in a natural van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3. This canalization lens exhibits the superior capability to resolve deeply subwavelength feature sizes down to 15&#160;nm, which represents a promising solution for non&#8208;destructive nanoelectronic circuit imaging and inspection.









Abstract
Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non&#8208;destructive method in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. However, conventional techniques such as dark&#8208;field scattering optics or atomic force microscopy (AFM) face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution or the inability to resolve subsurface features. Here, an approach is proposed that integrates the strengths of dark&#8208;field scattering optics and AFM by leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystals. This method enables ultrahigh&#8208;resolution subwavelength imaging with the ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 15&#160;nm and grating pitch detection down to 100&#160;nm. The underlying mechanism relies on the unique anisotropic properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, where its atomic&#8208;scale unit cells and biaxial symmetry facilitate the diffraction&#8208;free propagation of both evanescent and propagating waves via a flat&#8208;band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial&#8208;based superlenses and hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and uniaxial constraints, &#945;&#8208;MoO3 provides robust and super&#8208;resolution imaging in multiple directions. The approach is successfully applied to achieve high&#8208;resolution inspection of buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

The growing demand for freshwater and rising contamination of water sources require innovative treatment technologies. Sonicated carbon nanotubes can activate persulfate for selective contaminant degradation via nonradical pathways. This scalable approach enables rapid pollutant removal, offering a sustainable solution for decentralized freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The rising demand for freshwater and increasing contamination of distributed water sources, such as stormwater and surface water, necessitate innovative point&#8208;of&#8208;use treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using solid oxidants offer a promising approach for decentralized freshwater production but are often limited by nonselective radical reactions that degrade both pollutants and background water constituents. Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways&#8212;singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C&#9552;O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer. This approach achieves 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol removal, a common industrial and municipal pollutant, within 5&#160;min at a record removal rate of 4.80&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long&#8208;term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated. By advancing selective CNT catalysts for AOPs, this work offers a scalable, sustainable solution for point&#8208;of&#8208;use freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Micromotion&#8208;Driven &#8220;Mechanical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Pharmaceutical Coupling&#8221; Bone&#8208;Guiding Membrane Modulates Stress&#8208;Concentrating Inflammation Under Diabetic Fractures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotion activates a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;pharmaceutical&#8221; system, converting mechanical energy to electrical cues that trigger Met release. These cues suppress inflammation via M1&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis enhancement, while Met blocks NF&#8208;&#954;B (reducing cytokines) and activates AMPK (promoting bone/vessel growth). In diabetic fractures, Met&#8208;PF@PPy cut inflammation, boosted vasculature, and elevated bone metrics.









Abstract
The use of piezoelectric materials to convert micromechanical energy at the fracture site into electrical signals, thereby modulating stress&#8208;concentrated inflammation, has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for diabetic fractures. However, traditional bone&#8208;guiding membranes often face challenges in diabetic fracture repair due to their passive and imprecise drug release profiles. Herein, a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibrous membrane is fabricated through electrospinning and oxidative polymerization to load metformin (Met) into a polypyrrole (PPy) coating (Met&#8208;PF@PPy), creating a &#8220;mechanical&#8208;electrical&#8208;pharmaceutical coupling&#8221; system. In a micromotion mechanical environment, Met&#8208;PF@PPy converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, activating the electrochemical reduction of PPy and triggering stress&#8208;responsive Met release. The generated electrical signals suppress inflammation through M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage polarization and simultaneously enhance osteogenesis. Simultaneously, Met inhibits the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway to reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines while activating the AMPK pathway to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In a diabetic mouse femoral fracture model, Met&#8208;PF@PPy significantly reduces inflammatory markers, enhances vascularization, and increases bone mineral density and bone volume fraction by over 30%. This &#8220;force&#8208;electric&#8208;drug coupling&#8221; strategy provides an innovative approach for active regulation in diabetic fracture repair and offers a versatile platform for advancing piezoelectric materials in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Highly Tunable Relaxors Developed from Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor materials developed from the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 show a more complex phase transition and unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition compared with traditional relaxors developed from typical ferroelectrics, achieving ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability that can be sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.








Abstract
Highly responsive, voltage&#8208;tunable dielectrics are essential for microwave&#8208;telecommunication electronics. Ferroelectric/relaxor materials have been leading candidates for such functionality and have exhibited agile dielectric responses. Here, it is demonstrated that relaxor materials developed from antiferroelectrics can achieve both ultrahigh dielectric response and tunability. The system, based on alloying the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3 with the dielectric BaZrO3, exhibits a more complex phase evolution than that in traditional relaxors and is characterized by an unconventional multi&#8208;phase competition between antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric order. This interplay of phases can greatly enhance the local heterogeneities and results in relaxor characteristics while preserving considerable polarizability. Upon studying Pb1&#8208;xBaxZrO3 for x = 0&#8208;0.45, Pb0.65Ba0.35ZrO3 is found to provide for exceptional dielectric tunability under low bias fields (&#8776;81% at 200&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and &#8776;91% at 500&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) at 10&#160;kHz, outcompeting most traditional relaxor ferroelectric films. This high tunability is sustained in the radio&#8208;frequency range, resulting in a high commutation quality factor (&gt;2000 at 1&#160;GHz). This work highlights the phase evolution from antiferroelectrics (with lower, &#8220;positive&#8221; dielectric tunability) to relaxors (with higher, &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability), underscoring a promising approach to develop relaxors with enhanced functional capabilities and new possibilities.

         <title>Semipermeable Membrane&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Bonding Interface for Fabricating High&#8208;Performance Pure PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive flexible pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogel is developed inspired by the control of hierarchical phase separation, which is driven by the formation of dialysis&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interaction interface. The obtained hydrogel enables multi&#8208;scenario bioelectronic applications, including neural signals monitoring/stimulation within epileptic rats, human&#8208;machine interactions, and multimodal signal decoupling.








Abstract
Conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are potential bioelectronic interface materials because of their favorable mechanical properties and tunable electrochemical performances. Owing to intrinsic core&#8208;shell colloidal microstructure composed of insulative phase and conductive phase, inducing phase separation via diverse methods are proposed to improve their performances. However, fabrication of high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via a simple, mild strategy remains challenges. Here, we report a straightforward strategy to yield high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via the formation of semipermeable membrane&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interface. In this method, ethanol&#8208;attracted PSS is free to accumulate at the man&#8208;made interface provided by the semipermeable membrane, to realize controllable hierarchical PEDOT and PSS two&#8208;phase distribution. The separated PEDOT aggregates via &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, followed by the removal of rearranged insulative PSS phase easily, to form PEDOT:PSS hydrogels with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical performances. This work presents a universal, effective, and controlled strategy to design conductive hydrogels for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Interface Field&#8208;Effect Passivation Enabled by Selectively Extruded Cations for Printable Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect passivation is achieved by selectively extruded tetraphenylphosphonium cations for suppressing the interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, yielding an improved power conversion efficiency of 21.0% for hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL). However, the inherent mesoporous architecture introduces abundant interfacial defects that promote undesired non-radiative recombination, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To address this challenge, an interface field-effect passivation strategy is implemented, leveraging spatially selective cation extrusion. By incorporating tetraphenylphosphonium cations, sterically bulky organic ions that migrate to the perovskite/ETL interface during crystallization, a robust interfacial electrostatic field is introduced. This field simultaneously suppresses the non-radiative recombination by inducing field-effect passivation and enhances the charge extraction through optimizing energy alignment.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Ion Interactions Creating Dual&#8208;Nanoconfined Channels for Superior Mixed Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework membranes featuring abundant acidic groups and matching channel size are constructed. The strong membrane&#8208;ion interactions between the acidic sites and multivalent cations create a dual&#8208;nanoconfinement effect within rigid channels. This mechanism accelerates monovalent ions transport while hindering multivalent ions, enabling superior mixed ion separations.








Abstract
Ion transport in environments with mixed ions is crucial for numerous real&#8208;world applications. However, most membranes suffer from reduced selectivity in the mixed ion environment. Herein, the concept of dual&#8208;nanoconfined channels in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated for superior mixed mono&#8208;/multivalent ion separation. By incorporating acidic functionalities into the pore wall and coupling with a suitable pore size in the COF membranes, multivalent ions interact strongly with the acidic groups. This shields the interactions of the wall with monovalent ions, leaves sufficient space for fast monovalent ion passage, and in the meantime blocks multivalent ions, creating well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;nanoconfinement for mixed ion separation. Consequently, mixed Li+/Mg2+ ion selectivity exceeding 1,300 and mono&#8208;/trivalent ion selectivity over 9,000 is achieved. Molecular dynamics simulation and experiment with multiple ion pairs further confirm the mechanisms. The study sheds light on a fundamentally new design principle for mixed ion separation, offering the potential to reach remarkable selectivity in practical applications.

         <title>Large Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque with Multi&#8208;Directional Spin Components in Ni4W</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4W is theoretically proposed and experimentally verified as a promising unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) material for generating multi&#8208;directional spins. Epitaxial Ni4W thin films with outstanding crystallinity are grown by magnetron sputtering. Multi&#8208;directional spins are observed by harmonic Hall measurements, and the conventional SOT efficiency is evaluated to be 0.73, marking the largest value reported for unconventional SOT materials to date.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) offers an efficient mechanism for manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials in spintronics&#8208;based memory and logic devices. However, conventional SOT materials, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, are limited by high crystal symmetry to generating and injecting only in&#8208;plane spins into the ferromagnet. Low&#8208;symmetry materials and symmetry&#8208;breaking strategies have been employed to generate unconventional spin currents with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, enabling field&#8208;free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, a large SOT efficiency of 0.3 in the bulk Ni4W at room temperature is reported, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional SOT from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and Dresselhaus&#8208;like spin components are observed. Notably, a large SOT efficiency of 0.73 is observed in W/Ni4W (5&#160;nm), potentially resulting from additional interfacial contributions or extrinsic effects. Furthermore, field&#8208;free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been achieved using the multi&#8208;directional SOT of Ni4W, highlighting its potential as a low&#8208;symmetry SOT material for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

         <title>A Bionic Textile Sensory System for Humanoid Robots Capable of Intelligent Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is designed and fabricated by mimicking slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The PT sensor realizes the function of both SA and FA receptors based on a piezoresistive principle in a single sensor, and an artificial sensory system is constructed for real&#8208;time high&#8208;accuracy surface texture recognition.








Abstract
Artificial tactile perception systems that emulate the functions of slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors are essential for developing advanced prosthetics and humanoid robots. However, constructing a high&#8208;performance sensory system within a single device capable of simultaneously perceiving both static and dynamic forces for surface&#8208;texture recognition remains a critical challenge; this contrasts with common strategies integrating individual SA&#8208; and FA&#8208;mimicking sensors in multi&#8208;layered, multi&#8208;circuit configurations. Herein, a textile pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is reported based solely on piezoresistive principle alongside high sensitivity and rapid response to both high&#8208;frequency vibrations and static forces. These characteristics are attributed to the sensor's 3D multiscale architecture and the corresponding hierarchical structural deformation of its honeycomb&#8208;like sensing fabric. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface&#8208;texture&#8208;recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (&gt;98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50&#8211;300&#160;mm s&#8722;1). These results show promise for the future development of interactive artificial intelligence.

         <title>Minimizing Inter&#8208;Lattice Strain to Stabilize Li&#8208;Rich Cathode by Order&#8211;Disorder Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An order&#8211;disorder coherent design in Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered cathode enables homogeneous structural evolution during charge&#8211;discharge, minimizing lattice strain and suppressing structural degradation, leading to enhanced cycling stability with negligible voltage decay.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next&#8208;generation sustainable Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order&#8211;disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25&#160;V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order&#8211;disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a dedicated order&#8211;disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Level and Air&#8208;Stable Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8211;inorganic material with air&#8208;stable organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 20 h is obtained by immobilizing organic guests within inorganic B2O3&#8208;containing traps through hydrogen bonding. The charge carriers trapped/released by traps play an important role in the OLPL.









Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials show important application prospects in bioimaging due to their low biotoxicity and the ability to eliminate the interference of background fluorescence. However, OLPL materials suffer from poor environmental stability and short afterglow times. Herein, by introducing the phosphorescent guest 2, 3&#8208;naphthalimide (NAI) into the B2O3 (BO) matrix using a solvent&#8208;free method in an air atmosphere, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material NAI/BO is obtained, exhibiting OLPL lasting for more than 20&#160;h, visible to the naked eye for up to 180&#160;min. Photoluminescence and thermoluminescence spectra reveal that the OLPL originates from pure phosphorescence of NAI, and is induced by inorganic defects generated by oxygen vacancies in BO. The NAI electrons in the excited state can be captured by the defect, then detrapped through the thermal activation process, and eventually returned to the triplet state of NAI, thereby achieving OLPL emission. NAI/BO is successfully applied in vivo imaging stimulated in vitro. In addition, the universality of this strategy is verified by changing the phosphorescent guest molecules, enabling the regulation of OLPL from green to orange&#8211;red light. These results provide an important foundation for the design and development of stable OLPL materials and the practical applications in biological imaging.

         <title>Ligand Field&#8208;Induced Dual Active Sites Enhance Redox Potential of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate for Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work aims to explore the electrochemical performance and energy storage mechanism of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) in ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). The effect of ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites has been revealed for the first time. Ni atoms of NiHCF display electrochemical activity in AIBs. Additionally, Ni can balance the charge distribution and further enhance the redox potential.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox potential of cathode materials is vital for increasing the energy density of aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), with their inherently high redox potentials and open frameworks, are promising candidates. However, further boosting their redox potential and understanding their NH4+ ion storage mechanisms remain critical challenges. In this work, a novel ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage. The electron transfer from Ni to Fe within the Ni&#9472;N&#8801;C&#9472;Fe chain enhances the redox potential and electrochemical performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF). For the first time, the electrochemical activity of Ni is demonstrated in NiHCF during NH4+ ions intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation. NiHCF exhibits elevated redox potentials, superior rate performance, and robust cycling stability compared to iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework. These findings provide new insights into the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of PBAs and offer a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>Edge States in 2D A2PbBr4 Hybrid Perovskites Enabled by Local Structural Reorganization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;energy edge states in two&#8208;dimensional hybrid lead halide perovskites are driven by Rashba/Dresselhaus spin splitting, resulting from local structural distortions at the crystal edges. Strained PbBr6 octahedra cause out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions, breaking inversion symmetry and enabling spin splitting. These edge states with enhanced charge dynamics facilitate efficient light emission and could improve device performance in spintronic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The edge states (ES) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A2PbBr4 (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced&#160;by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of adjacent PbBr6 octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin&#8208;splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.

         <title>Over Tenfold Increase in Current Amplification Due to Anisotropic Polymer Chain Alignment in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to boost the IDS output of an OECT? Anisotropic polymer alignment along the channel direction enables a 13&#8208;fold increase in IDS. Such channel engineering opens the door to unprecedented signal amplification (here gmL/Wd = 2 580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a PBTTT&#8208;backbone bearing single&#8208;ether side chains), faster ON/OFF switching, and improved stability for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are central to the development of highly sensitive (bio)sensors, energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic devices, and high&#8208;precision electrophysiological monitoring systems. With growing interest in these strategic electronic devices, a novel PBTTT polymer bearing single&#8208;ether side chains (PBTTT&#8208;8O) in OECTs is investigated. Pristine isotropic non&#8208;aligned OECT performance matches state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transconductance, highlighting the potential of single ethers for designing high&#8208;performance organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). Moreover, a 13&#215; enhancement of current output is achieved by anisotropic polymer chain alignment of PBTTT&#8208;8O, opening doors to unprecedented device sensitivity. Compared to pristine ones, aligned OECTs afford a 6&#215; increase in the normalized transconductance (gmL/Wd), reaching an unprecedented 2&#160;580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Such improvement is mainly due to a gain in carrier mobility &#181;, as evidenced by four distinct methods. In addition, aligned OECTs exhibit faster doping front propagation, ON switching, and OFF switching compared to pristine ones. This study hence reports a versatile and easily transferable approach to concomitantly boost signal amplification and accelerate the response time of bioelectronic devices.

Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot color conversion layers are produced via a versatile crosslinking strategy. The color conversion layers exhibit minimal backlight leakage under mechanical strain, support high&#8208;resolution patterning, and integrate seamlessly with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. Their incorporation in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare sensors highlights their potential for next&#8208;generation stretchable displays.








Abstract
Stretchable displays are essential components as signal outputs in next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics, particularly for robotic skin and wearable device technologies. Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable and patternable color conversion layers (CCLs) offer practical solutions for developing full&#8208;color stretchable micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) displays. However, significant challenges remain in creating stretchable and patternable CCLs without backlight leakage under mechanical deformation. Here, a novel material strategy for stretchable and patternable heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot (QD) CCLs, potentially useful for robotic skin and wearable electronics is presented. Through a versatile crosslinking technique, uniform and high&#8208;concentration QD loading in the elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane matrix without loss of optical properties is achieved. These CCLs demonstrate excellent color conversion capabilities with minimal backlight leakage, even under 50% tensile strain. Additionally, fine&#8208;pixel patterning process with resolutions up to 300 pixels per inch is compatible with the QD CCLs, suitable for high&#8208;resolution stretchable display applications. The integration of these CCLs with micro&#8208;LED displays is also demonstrated, showcasing their use in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare monitoring sensors. This study offers a promising material preparation methodology for stretchable QDs/polymer composites and highlights their potential for advancing flexible and wearable light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>In Situ Magnetoelectric Generation of miRNA Sponges and Wireless Electric Stimulus by Conductive Granular Scaffolds for Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) is developed to enable wireless electrical stimulation and targeted miRNA modulation for traumatic brain injury (TBI) repair. Acting as both an antenna and a gene delivery platform, cGRAS facilitates miRNA sponge formation and neuronal regeneration via AMF&#8208;triggered electroporation and mechanotransduction, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved functional recovery.








Abstract
Electronic signaling and microRNA (miRNA) regulation play pivotal roles in determining neuronal cell fate and promoting brain recovery. Despite this, clinical advancements are hindered by the limited availability of tools for spatiotemporal electrical signaling and non&#8208;viral gene modulation in neurons in vivo. In this study, a conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) that doubles as an antenna and neuronal gene delivery agent for targeted miRNA regulation of nerve repair in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is developed. The inherent features of granular scaffolds reduce the inflammation and glial scarring in TBI by mitigating activated microglia and stellate cells. Upon irradiation with an external alternating magnetic field (AMF), the &#8220;electromagnetic messenger&#8221; induces electrical stimulation to restore brain function and promotes temporal electroporation. This process, together with mechanotransduction capability of cGRAS, enhances the delivery and formation of miRNA sponges both in vitro and in vivo, thereby reducing the overexpression of miR6263, which is significantly upregulated upon neuronal injury. In the whole brain imaging analysis, suppression of inflammation, angiogenesis around the TBI cavity, and infiltration of newborn neurons in the injured area are observed after in situ magnetoelectric formation of miRNA sponges and wireless electric stimulus, leading to improved brain function and behavioral recovery. Overall, this cGRAS represents a potentially innovative and versatile tool for clinical neuronal regeneration engineering.

         <title>Discovering Stable Amorphous Ceramics: From Computational Prediction to Thin&#8208;Film Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a computationally guided approach to discovering stable amorphous ceramics, using yttrium tungsten nitride (Y&#8208;W&#8208;N) as a prototype. By combining first&#8208;principles random structure sampling with thin&#8208;film synthesis, the authors identify and experimentally realize previously unreported amorphous nitrides, demonstrating their exceptional thermal stability, tunable properties, and superior diffusion barrier performance.








Abstract
Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are not observed in their crystalline counterparts making them invaluable for many applications in science and technology, such as electronic and optical devices, solid&#8208;state batteries, and protective coatings. However, finding compositions that are stable against crystallization and/or phase separation, and at the same time offer the needed functionality in the amorphous phase is still largely done by serendipity or trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. In this work, using yttrium tungsten nitride as a prototype, it is shown how computational random structure sampling provides a robust method to identify compositions that exhibit a highly corrugated potential energy surface with many narrow local minima, which are consequently hard to crystallize and remain stable in the amorphous phase. Synthesis experiments prove that the predicted nitride is readily synthesized in an amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. High&#8208;throughput and conventional characterization of structural, physical, and functional properties of the discovered amorphous nitride compound reveal its attractive properties and possible application potential. The proposed workflow combining theory and experiment is broadly applicable to the discovery of a wide range of amorphous ceramic materials, paving the way for advanced amorphous materials for diverse emerging technologies.

         <title>Polyanhydride&#8208;Based Microparticles for Programmable Pulsatile Release of Diphtheria Toxoid (DT) for Single&#8208;Injection Self&#8208;Boosting Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a polyanhydride&#8208;based delivery platform for single&#8208;injection, self&#8208;boosting vaccines. The system enables programmable, pulsatile release of diphtheria toxoid with high antigen recovery and is guided by machine learning for tunability. In vivo results show immune responses comparable to multi&#8208;dose regimens, highlighting its potential to improve vaccine accessibility and reduce under&#8208;immunization.








Abstract
Vaccination remains a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, yet its effectiveness is undermined by under&#8208;immunization, particularly for vaccines requiring multiple doses that patients fail to complete. To address this challenge, the development of single&#8208;injection platforms delivering self&#8208;boosting vaccines has gained significant attention. Despite some advances, translating these platforms into clinical applications has been limited. In this study, a novel polyanhydride&#8208;based polymeric delivery platform is introduced, designed for single&#8208;injection self&#8208;boosting vaccines, replacing multiple doses. Over 20 polyanhydride polymers are synthesized and screened, ultimately down selecting to 6 for in vitro studies, and 2 for in vivo studies. Using diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a model antigen, programmed pulsatile release with a narrow window is demonstrated, ideal for self&#8208;boosting immunization. The platform effectively protects the pH&#8208;sensitive antigen before release, achieving recovery rate of 39.7% to 89.7%. The system's tunability is further enhanced by machine learning algorithms, which accurately predict release profiles, confirmed through experimental validation. In vivo studies in a mouse model reveals that the platform induces DT&#8208;specific antibody responses comparable to those generated by traditional multi&#8208;dose regimens. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of this platform to deliver various vaccines, offering a potentially promising solution to the global challenge of under&#8208;immunization.

         <title>Conductance Reinforced Relaxation Attenuation with Strong Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Multivariate &#960;&#8208;Conjugated MOFs for Integrated Radar&#8208;Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages a conductance&#8208;reinforced attenuation mechanism via enhanced Metal&#8208;N coordination to boost electron mobility and optimize electromagnetic response. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated MOFs are 3D&#8208;printed into a stealth drone propeller that achieves both radar and infrared stealth.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-conjugated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, owning to their high conductivity and versatile structural tunability. Nevertheless, the effective control over their dielectric properties is a challenge. Herein, the charge carrier migration in &#960;-conjugated MOFs is harnessed to significantly amplify the electromagnetic response, where the strengthened atom coordination can activate a distinctive conductance-reinforced attenuation mechanism. This results in finely calibrated EMW absorption characteristics, including a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 6.0 GHz at mere 2 mm, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;46.7 dB at 3.5 mm, and a substantial reduction in radar cross-section (RCS) up to &#8722;23.3 dBm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the seamless integration of the &#960;-conjugated MOF hybrids within ultraviolet (UV)-curable 3D printing technology has enabled the fabrication of a stealth-enabled drone propeller prototype, which exhibits a remarkably low infrared emissivity of 0.205.

         <title>Optimizing Printed Quasi&#8208;2D Luminescent Perovskite Films via Delaminated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ heterogeneous nucleation strategy for quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films via microelectronic printing is demonstrated, employing delaminated Cd&#8208;MOF as modulators. The layered Cd&#8208;MOF framework facilitates controlled nucleation, regulates phase distribution, and promotes stress relaxation, yielding films with an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield and enhanced stability. These advancements underscore the potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials for optoelectronics.








Abstract
Microelectronic printing technology has recently emerged as a key approach in advancing pixel&#8208;array perovskite films, particularly quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, to meet current scientific and technological demands. However, its further development remains hindered by the uncontrollable crystallization of perovskite during the printing process. Herein, a novel in situ heterogeneous nucleation growth approach for obtaining quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films is demonstrated, utilizing delaminated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (i.e., layered Cd&#8208;MOF) with an ordered structure as modulators. The inosculation of phenylethylammonium (PEA+) with layered Cd&#8208;MOF serves as crystal nuclei, facilitating heterogeneous crystal nucleation and growth while regulating the distribution of the n&#8208;phase. Moreover, the intercalation of the layered Cd&#8208;MOF alleviates rigid stress, thereby eliminating defects in the printed films. The resulting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films exhibit an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 37.40% along with exceptional luminescent stability, making them promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications. Overall, this study highlights the significant potential of MOF&#8208;assisted synthesis in advancing high&#8208;performance perovskite materials through microelectronic printing technology, offering a promising pathway for the development of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mannosylated MOF Encapsulated in Lactobacillus Biofilm for Dual&#8208;Targeting Intervention Against Mammalian Escherichia coli Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a dual&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;system (Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB) against Escherichia coli infection. Mannosylated Zn&#8208;MOF aggregates bacteria via FimH recognition and disrupts biofilms, while Lactobacillus biofilm encapsulation enables gut&#8208;targeted immunomodulation and sustains nanomaterial release. The system restores microbiota equilibrium and promotes stem cell differentiation and barrier stability. This approach demonstrates cross&#8208;species anti&#8208;diarrheal efficacy, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.








Abstract
Pathogenic bacterial infections pose a major concern, especially concerning mammalian enteritis and diarrhea. Compared to conventional antibiotic intervention, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit superior antibacterial properties and lower&#160;cytotoxicity, demonstrating great promise in the treatment of pathogen&#8208;induced diarrhea. However, the achievement of their precise targeted delivery is still a significant challenge. Herein, a novel precision nano&#8208;system with a dual&#8208;targeting approach for treating intestinal infections caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) is designed. First, Zn&#8208;MOF was synthesized based on ZnO, which possessed enhanced elimination of planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Through mannosylation, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man specifically recognized the FimH pili of E. coli, leading to its aggregation and subsequent eradication. Second, guided by whole genome sequencing, the encapsulation of Lactobacillus biofilm exertd immunomodulatory function, overcomed challenges related to intestinal targeting, and facilitated sustained drug release. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;MOF@Man/LRB maintaind microbiota equilibrium and promoted stem cell differentiation and barrier stability, ensuring consistent anti&#8208;diarrheal and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy in mice, piglets, and humans. This approach represents a novel dual&#8208;targeting antimicrobial strategy, combining probiotic biofilms and E. coli&#8208;oriented delivery, advancing safe and effective treatment that restores intestinal homeostasis for potential applications in both human medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Ultralight and Elastic Polyimide Microtube Aerogel via Airflow&#8208;Induced Spinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning. PMAS has ultralow density, excellent thermal insulation properties and compression resilience over a wide temperature range, and can be applied in thermal insulation. Notably, airflow&#8208;induced spinning technology fills the gaps in industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube.








Abstract
Flexible thermal protection is of great significance in fields facing various environments such as aerospace and electric vehicles. Elastic aerogels with micro&#8208;nanofibers as the base unit effectively solve the force&#8208;thermal compatibility, optimized the contradiction between mechanical strength and thermal insulation performance, and solves the risk of fragile aerogel. In order to develop elastic aerogels with lower density and better thermal insulation properties. Here, the first one&#8208;step preparation of ultralight polyimide microtube aerogel sponges (PMAS) using airflow&#8208;induced spinning is reported. PMAS consists of a large number of structurally controllable microtube, resulting in ultralight density (&#8776;50&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultralow thermal conductivity (37&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#183;K at 25&#160;&#176;C), and excellent elasticity and fatigue resistance, with no significant attenuation of the maximum stress after 1000 cycles of compression at 80% strain. In addition, PMAS has temperature&#8208;invariant dynamic mechanical stability and an operating temperature range from 77 to 573 K. These superior properties enable PMAS to be ideal choice for thermal insulation in extreme environments, thermal runaway in batteries, adsorption and gas filling. Airflow&#8208;induced spinning fills the gap in the industrial&#8208;scale preparation and material compatibility of microtube, while also providing a promising solution for the universal preparation of microtube structures.

         <title>Efficient Red Perovskite LEDs with Iodine Management via Volatile Additive I2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental iodine (I2) is used to create an iodine&#8208;rich environment for inhibiting the formation of iodine vacancy defects. This strategy also modifies the perovskite's surface energy, regulating its crystallization kinetics and resulting in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with a preferred (001)&#8208;orientation. Consequently, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and 29.5% for pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face a tough challenge that halogen vacancy defects limit device performance, while the introduction of additional agents to passivate defects may potentially compromise the stability of the structure and increase the complexity of the system. Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine&#8208;rich condition and to transform into I&#8722; ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with vertically&#8208;aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Elemental iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used to create an iodine-rich environment for inhibiting the formation of iodine vacancy defects. This strategy also modifies the perovskite's surface energy, regulating its crystallization kinetics and resulting in a more well-crystallized perovskite with a preferred (001)-orientation. Consequently, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% for deep-red (678 nm) and 29.5% for pure-red (649 nm) have been achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face a tough challenge that halogen vacancy defects limit device performance, while the introduction of additional agents to passivate defects may potentially compromise the stability of the structure and increase the complexity of the system. Here, elemental iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine-rich condition and to transform into I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well-crystallized perovskite with vertically-aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep-red (678 nm) and pure-red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origami Silicon Anodes: Geometric Design for Structural Elasticity and Connectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origami&#8208;capsule silicon anode materials, synthesized via a magnesiothermic crystallization approach, integrate elastic 2D nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated in a pressure&#8208;tolerant carbon shell. This architecture ensures structural resilience, efficient ion transport, and stress&#8208;resistant integrity, achieving high capacity (2945 mAh g&#8315;1), ultralow swelling (14.7%), and 100% capacity retention at 6 A g&#8315;1 over 470 cycles.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity battery electrodes with large volume changes remains a significant challenge, with their mechanical failure and sluggish kinetics, primarily due to inadequate structural accommodation and inefficient transport pathways. Here, a magnesiothermic crystallization approach is presented to construct origami capsule (OC) architectures, imparting flexibility and conformability to inherently brittle silicon, featuring highly interconnected 2D silicon nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm thickness) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated within a pressure&#8208;tolerant conformal microshell. The design leverages geometric features at both the nanoscale (within nanosheets) and microscale (capsule assembly) to impart structural elasticity and connectivity for efficient stress dissipation, enhancing mechanical integrity and rapid transport kinetics. Consequently, the OC anode exhibits low electrode swelling (14.7%) at 2945 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional rate capability, delivering a high capacity and &#8776;100% retention after 470 cycles at a large current density of 6 A g&#8722;1. This work bridges geometric design and materials science, opening new avenues for high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Nonlinear Conductive Graphene Composites for Pressure Sensing with a Linear Response and Voltage&#8208;Driven Thermal Correction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear conductive graphene composite (NcGc) layer, incorporating a conductive laser&#8208;reduced graphene oxide layer, is assembled into flexible pressure sensors without microstructural designs, achieving high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1) and a wide linear sensing range (&gt;800&#160;kPa). The nonlinear conductivity of the NcGc layer enables bias&#8208;tunable sensitivity, inherently correcting thermal drifts and thereby preserving the precision of robotic gripper manipulation across varying temperatures.








Abstract
Thermal fluctuations pose a significant challenge to the signal stability of nanomaterial&#8208;based piezoresistive pressure sensors, limiting their effectiveness in applications such as electronic skin and robotics. Conventional temperature compensation strategies often rely on additional thermal sensors or complex calibration algorithms. Here, a flexible pressure sensor is reported featuring a nonlinear conductive graphene composite layer within a bilayer architecture, enabling bias voltage&#8208;controlled sensitivity without structural redesign. The sensor achieves ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (742.3 kPa&#8722;1), a broad linear sensing range of up to 800&#160;kPa (R2 = 0.99913), and excellent long&#8208;term durability over 10&#8201;000 cycles. Crucially, the unique nonlinear characteristics enable the bias voltage to function as an internal remote control for correcting temperature drifts between 25 and 60&#160;&#176;C, as demonstrated by precise manipulation in robotic grippers under varying temperature conditions. This work offers a universal strategy for building environmentally adaptive sensors, advancing the development of robust and high&#8208;precision wearable electronics.

         <title>Manipulation of Interface Recombination via Multi&#8208;Site Passivator for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>

This work presents a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy that uses Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the substantial performance losses when scaling up perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs).

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown remarkable progress in laboratory&#8208;scale devices, but their scalability to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) remains challenging due to significant performance loss. Here, a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy is reported by employing Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the critical issues of interface recombination and stability in both PSCs and PSMs. TK&#8208;NHS effectively inactivates common defects, by modifying the surface of perovskite films through multi&#8208;site synergistical interactions. Additionally, a stable dipole layer formed at the interface optimizes energy level alignment, facilitating efficient electron extraction and transport. The resulting perovskite film exhibited a smoother and more homogeneous surface, thus improving interface contact and reducing nonradiative recombination. Consequently, TK&#8208;NHS&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.16%, with significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.188&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 85.3%. The scalable potential of this multi&#8208;site passivation strategy has been verified by corresponding PSMs, delivering an impressive PCE of 22.25%. Notably, the devices exhibited exceptional operational stability, retaining 91.4% and 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 and 800 h of continuous illumination, respectively. Thereby advancing the progress of the scaled&#8208;up production of PSCs to modules.

         <title>Dynamic Switching Spin State of Fe Single Atoms for Piezoelectric&#8208;Mediated Overall Nitrogen Fixation Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an alternating piezoelectric field is introduced into Fe SAs anchored defective&#8208;BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), and dynamic and bidirectional switching of spin&#8208;states can be realized to simultaneously facilitate ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis for achieving record ONF activity and energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven one&#8208;step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra&#8208;low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), enabling the formation spatially&#8208;separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d&#8208;electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO&#8208;Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical&#160;conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi&#8208;directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.

This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi-directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bionic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; Cascade Effect In Situ to Accelerate Critical&#8208;Sized Bone Defect Repair</title>

The bionic PPCs&#8208;TENG accelerates CSBD repair through the activation of a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect. It generates bio&#8208;ES that dynamically responds to the host's mechanical state, exhibiting a resting membrane potential during static conditions and generating action potentials upon mechanical deformation. This bio&#8208;ES activates both extracellular and intracellular biochemical factors, leading to enhanced osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic processes in CSBDs.








Abstract
The loss of the intrinsic &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in critical&#8208;sized bone defects (CSBDs) impedes the bone self&#8208;healing process. Traditional strategies cannot provide bionic electrical output, thereby failing to sufficiently activate the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in situ and limiting the repair efficiency of CSBDs. Here, a bionic, self&#8208;adhesive, and biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) called PPCs&#8208;TENG using silk&#8208;fibroin&#8208;derived peptide (Cs)&#8208;grafted polydopamine&#8211;polyacrylamide (PPCs) as the electrode layer is fabricated. It provides bionic electrical stimulation (bio&#8208;ES) in response to the host's motion status. It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real&#8208;time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio&#8208;ES generated from PPCs&#8208;TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis&#8208;related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano&#8208;transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. In vivo tests demonstrate that PPCs&#8208;TENG significantly accelerates the repair of CSBDs in situ.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Polyurethane&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Ion&#8208;Conductive Elastomers with Exceptional Strength and Ionic Conductivity for Multifunctional Strain Sensors and Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing, recyclable polyurethane&#8208;based conductor (DACPU/100Li) is engineered via supramolecular and dynamic covalent networks, exhibiting ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), 1200% stretchability, and tear resistance (45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Its sensor enables machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted gesture recognition (sensitivity 5.89, strain 0.1&#8211;1000%), while its triboelectric nanogenerator harvests energy (3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2) and supports machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted object recognition.








Abstract
Flexible ionic conductors hold potential for wearable sensors and energy harvesting. However, most gel&#8208;based conductors suffer from solvent evaporation and liquid leakage, limiting practical applications. Although solid&#8208;state ionic conductors mitigate these issues, achieving strong mechanics, high conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and stability remains challenging. Here, by integrating supramolecular engineering and dynamic covalent adaptive networks, a self&#8208;healing polyurethane&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (DACPU/100Li) with outstanding overall properties is successfully synthesized. DACPU/100Li exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity (1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and high tensile strength (7.62&#160;MPa), along with an elongation at break of 1200%. Additionally, it exhibits excellent tear resistance and a fracture energy of 45.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, along with 96% self&#8208;healing efficiency (after self&#8208;healing at 120&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h), good recyclability, and stability under extreme conditions. The DACPU/100Li&#8208;based sensor has high sensitivity (5.89) and a wide strain range (0.1&#8211;1000%). Integrated with machine learning, it enables precise gesture recognition and human&#8211;machine interaction. Furthermore, the triboelectric nanogenerator based on DACPU/100Li achieves a high power density of 3.87&#160;W m&#8722;2. It harvests energy from body motion to power small devices and aids object recognition via machine learning. It is believed that these solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;conductive elastomers provide new opportunities for wearable electronics, energy harvesting, and ionotronics.

         <title>Building Unit Engineering Toward COF Membranes with Controlled Stacking for H2 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework nanosheets are engineered via ternary monomer design to achieve programmable interlayer offsets. Non&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized monomers induce interlayer torsion, transitioning AA to AA' and AB stacking for angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning. The mechanically robust, blade&#8208;cast membranes exhibit exceptional H&#8322;/CO&#8322; selectivity up to 60 in gas mixtures from methanol&#8208;reforming.








Abstract
Hydrogen purification by membrane technology offers a sustainable path to meet the escalating demands of green energy. However, conventional polymeric membranes are constrained by permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and instability under real&#8208;world operating conditions. While covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold promise, their overlarge pores and poor film&#8208;processibility are to be imperatively solved. Herein, a ternary building unit system is designed for synthesizing imine&#8208;based COF nanosheets with programmable interlayer offsets. By synergizing a planar aldehyde monomer as the basic structural unit and a none&#8208;planar alkyl&#8208;functionalized aldehyde monomer as the structure regulation unit, we induce layer distortion that disrupts &#960;&#8211;&#960; dominated AA stacking, enabling angstrom&#8208;precise pore tuning (1.4&#8211;0.6&#160;nm) via controlled transitions to AB stacking while retaining crystallinity. The mechanically robust nanosheets are easily assembled into large&#8208;area membranes via a facile blade casting, overcoming the processability bottleneck associated with binary building unit systems. The resulting membranes demonstrate an exceptional H2/CO2 selectivity of 60, surpassing existing benchmarks. When treating gas mixtures from methanol steam reforming, a two&#8208;stage membrane process achieves 99.5% H2 purity and 94.0% recovery. Precise modulation of pore architecture and mechanical flexibility through building units engineered stacking affords a platform for microporous organic membranes.

         <title>Cyanobenzene&#8208;Modified Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptors with Optimal Excitonic Behavior Enable Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are synthesized by regulating central&#8208;core cyanobenzene substitution for the first time. The asymmetric substitution increases the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 20.16%. The corresponding device exhibits higher thermal stability and better excitonic behavior, providing important insights for the design of SMAs.








Abstract
Cyanogroup (&#8208;CN) is a strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high&#8208;performance small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN&#8208;F, phCN&#8208;Cl, 2phCN&#8208;F, and 2phCN&#8208;Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN&#8208;F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85&#176;C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability.

&lt;p&gt;Four novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are synthesized by regulating central-core cyanobenzene substitution for the first time. The asymmetric substitution increases the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 20.16%. The corresponding device exhibits higher thermal stability and better excitonic behavior, providing important insights for the design of SMAs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanogroup (-CN) is a strongly electron-withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high-performance small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN-F, phCN-Cl, 2phCN-F, and 2phCN-Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene-substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene-substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN-F-based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN-F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85&#176;C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene-substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record-breaking SMAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable, Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Poly(urethane&#8208;urea) Elastomer Resistant to Humidity and Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent polyurethane with a microphase separation structure exhibits excellent stretchability properties and ultralong phosphorescence. Different afterglow color effects are achieved by modifying the structure of the phosphor. The polyurethane demonstrates remarkable resistance to humidity and heat. The potential applications of polymers in flexible light&#8208;emitting devices, information encryption systems, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies are explored.








Abstract
Polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials exhibiting facile processability, high thermal stability, and environmental compatibility have garnered considerable attention. However, achieving excellent stretchability in simultaneity with ultralong RTP remains challenging because most RTP polymers rely on rigid structures with inherently poor tensile properties. Herein, a stretchable, ultralong RTP polyurethane is prepared through copolymerizing a novel phosphor dihydroxy&#8208;functionalized indolocarbazole, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (HMDI), poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTMEG 2000), and adipic dihydrazide (AD). The phosphor is covalently bonded to the polyurethane backbone, which facilitates the stabilization of triplet excitons and achieves ultralong RTP. The obtained copolymers exhibit a maximum strain of 1400% and the longest phosphorescence lifetime of 1888 ms. Additionally, the polyurethanes exhibiting different afterglow colors are prepared by varying the molecular structure of the phosphor. Notably, the RTP polyurethane materials also display resistance to humidity and heat. This work may provide a new option for the development of stretchable, ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photoactive Ferroelectric Semiconductor Incorporating Aromatic Dynamic Spacer Enables Optoelectronic Synaptic Plasticity</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;pendulum&#8208;like&#8221; motions of aromatic cations are customized in the 2D constrained environments to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics with unique photo&#8208;ferroelectric coupling effects, which enables the construction of heterojunction phototransistors with superior optoelectronic synaptic plasticity.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics are capturing the growing interest for their unique light&#8208;polarization coupling and optoelectronic applicability. However, the formidable challenge persists in coupling electric order and strong photoactivity through precise molecular design, hindering their further application in the field of optoelectronic memory. Herein, the molecular dynamics of aromatic cations in the 2D constrained environments are customized to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics, (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3I10, showing a narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.96&#160;eV) and strong visible&#8208;photosensitivity. Notably, multi&#8208;level dynamic states of aromatic cations provide the impetus for inducing ferroelectric order and photo&#8208;ferroelectric effects. Such captivating characteristics can achieve light&#8208;induced multiple polarization, dielectric, and conductivity states. Accordingly, photoferroelectrics are integrated into heterojunction phototransistors that display robust electrical and optical modulation, including diversified synaptic plasticity with low optical program power (&#8776;20 pJ) for each training process. As a noteworthy advancement in the photoferroelectric field, this work will enrich the understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and shed light on further exploration toward neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Highly Repeatable and Cyclically Stable Mechanoluminescence of the Flexible Composite Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solid&#8208;solution strategy to modulate the mechanoluminescence of the composite elastomer with the physical principles proposed. With no need for power supply and circuit design, the developed CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer yields bright and repeatable light for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions, significantly breaking the performance limitations of the existing materials.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) elastomer shows tremendous potential for the next generation of flexible displaying, imaging, and sensing devices. However, inadequate repeatability and cyclic stability are the current bottlenecks. In this work, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is reported to regulate the interfacial interactions of ML elastomer, in which the (Ca,Ba)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu solid solutions and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are employed, respectively. The results suggest that the solid&#8208;solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions. This work not only provides a highly repeatable and cyclically stable ML elastomer but also clarifies the intrinsic physical principles, showing high guiding significance for future ML design and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes with Negligible Voltage Decay through Migration Retardation Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high entropy design effectively inhibits the structural degradation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials during cycling, including the oxygen vacancy formation, volume expansion, and Mn coordination environment disordering, thus significantly improving the voltage retention and energy output. This migration retardation effect is attributed to the synergistic enhancement of covalency and ionicity, which makes Mn ion migration thermodynamically infeasible.








Abstract
The development of advanced Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LRO) is essential for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, LRO exhibits large voltage hysteresis and rapid voltage decay with irreversible TM migration upon prolonged cycling. Given that high&#8208;entropy oxides have expanded the potential for retarding the harmful phase transition and regulating the site energies, therefore a high&#8208;entropy Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.12Co0.12Mg0.03Cu0.02Ti0.02Nb0.02O2 cathode is synthesized (HELRO) for LIBs in the present study, demonstrated significantly improved voltage retention and energy output. In addition, this work unveils the sluggish degradation of superlattice and local structure in HELRO during long charge&#8211;discharge cycles and explains the &#8220;migration retardation effect.&#8221; The higher configurational entropy contributes to the higher energy barriers for in&#8208;plane, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, and continuous Mn migrations due to the synergistic ionic&#8211;covalent enhancement of Mn&#9472;O bonds. This work provides new insights for understanding the improvement mechanisms of high entropy cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of suppressing long&#8208;standing voltage decay by high entropy design combining covalent and ionic elements.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Li2ZrO3: A New Choice for Boosting Homogenous Distribution and Transport of Lithium Ion in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;vacancy lithium zirconate (O&#8208;LZO) reduces the bonding between lithium ion (Li+) and anions in lithium salts, promoting dissociation and increasing the concentration of free Li+. Kinetic simulations confirm the excellent intrinsic Li+ diffusion capability of O&#8208;LZO. As an active filler, O&#8208;LZO broadens Li+ transport pathways and enhances the dissociation and distribution of lithium salts, improving overall electrolyte performance.








Abstract
The low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid&#8208;state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)&#8208;vacancies (O&#8208;LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs (PEO@O&#8208;LZO). The O&#8208;LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O&#8208;vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O&#8208;vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O&#8208;LZO at 40&#160;&#176;C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O&#8208;LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40&#160;&#176;C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Anion Regulation for High&#8208;Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb and All&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8208;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Ac&#8722; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&#8208; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are integral to all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&#8722; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8722;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual&#8208;anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all&#8208;perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Immobilization of Covalent Triazine Framework into Hydrogels for Photothermal&#8208;Promoted Gas&#8208;Solid Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel floatable hydrogen&#8208;freshwater cogeneration hybrid hydrogel featuring a dynamic gas&#8208;solid interface toward photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is reported. The synergy of photothermal materials and 3D nanostructured hydrogel on covalent triazine framework facilitates solar interfacial evaporation and enhanced hydrogen production, highlighting its great potential for scalable and sustainable solar energy utilization.








Abstract
Organic photocatalysts generally suffer from insufficient near&#8208;infrared light absorption and undesirable photogenerated charge transport properties, resulting in unfavorable hydrogen evolution performance from water splitting. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also known to be significantly influenced by the interfacial charge and mass transfer in a catalyst/H2O biphase system. Herein, for the first time, a highly stable and floating hydrogen&#8208;water cogeneration hybrid hydrogel that utilizes&#160;photothermal&#8208;induced interface microenvironment variation to accelerate sluggish photocatalytic water splitting reaction is reported. Supported by solar&#8208;powered interfacial evaporation and efficient vapor generation, the rationally designed hydrogel effectively transforms the conventional liquid&#8208;solid interface into a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic interface. The presence of gas&#8208;liquid coexistence state offers a disordered and loose hydrogen&#8208;bond network while preserving the proton transfer channel, greatly reducing reaction activation energy and interfacial energy barriers. The improved heat and mass transfer together with optimized charge transfer pathways suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, the integrated photothermal&#8208;coupled solar photocatalytic hydrogel exhibits excellent operational stability and self&#8208;adaptive rotation in seawater, mitigating salt accumulation and achieving an exceptional vapor generation rate of 4.71&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and a hydrogen&#8208;evolving rate of 1961.25&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under one sun illumination.

         <title>P&#8208;Band Center Engineering of Sulfur to Weaken Fe&#9472;S Bond Toward Superior Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique v&#8208;FeS2@C composite is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits record&#8208;breaking rate capability and long&#8208;life cycle performance. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers the best specific capacity and long cyclic stability, much more superior to that of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based sulfides are appealing anodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high theoretical capacity, low&#8208;cost, and excellent mechanical/thermal stability. However, achieving high electrochemical performances in such anodes is hindered by the strong Fe&#9472;S bonds and sluggish kinetics. Here, a unique carbon&#8208;coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v&#8208;FeS2@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p&#8208;band center (&#603;
p) of S and then decouple it from the d&#8208;band center (&#603;d) of Fe, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The obtained v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability of 438.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 70 A g&#8722;1 and remarkable long&#8208;life cycle performance (512.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 8000 cycles at 40 A g&#8722;1). Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of v&#8208;FeS2@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers the best specific capacity (211.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1) and long cyclic stability (459.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Such performances are much more superior to those of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides.

The v-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C anode exhibits record-breaking rate capability and long-life cycle performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-based sulfides are appealing anodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high theoretical capacity, low-cost, and excellent mechanical/thermal stability. However, achieving high electrochemical performances in such anodes is hindered by the strong Fe&#9472;S bonds and sluggish kinetics. Here, a unique carbon-coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p-band center (&lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of S and then decouple it from the d-band center (&lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of Fe, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The obtained v-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C anode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability of 438.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 70 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable long-life cycle performance (512.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 8000 cycles at 40 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Particularly, the sodium-ion full cell composed of v-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C anode and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode delivers the best specific capacity (211.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 40 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and long cyclic stability (459.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Such performances are much more superior to those of the other iron-based sulfides. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting SIBs' performances of iron-based sulfides by regulating p-band center (&lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of S and weakening Fe&#9472;S bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Design of Solid&#8211;Liquid Hybrid Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode structure includes: an upper liquid metal phase containing silicon microparticles, which can connect fractured silicon and form a stable interface during cycling processes; and a lower solid&#8208;phase copper&#8208;gallium alloy, which ensures the robust adhesion of the electrode to the current collector during flexing processes.








Abstract
The silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (&gt;300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid&#8208;phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid&#8208;phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of &gt;99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high&#8208;voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2, high volumetric energy density of 500&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0&#160;mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Resonant Levels Induced Seebeck Coefficient Matching Contributes to High Thermoelectric Cooling Efficiency in p&#8208;type SnSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that doping indium (In) in p&#8208;type SnSe introduced resonant levels near the Fermi level in the valence bands, effectively enhancing the local density of states and significantly boosting the Seebeck coefficient. These improvements result in extraordinary near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric performances. Specifically, the optimal SnSe&#8208;0.7%In sample achieved a PF of &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2, and a ZT of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K.








Abstract
Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising thermoelectric cooling candidate, exhibiting room&#8208;temperature performance comparable to that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). However, the Seebeck coefficient of p&#8208;type SnSe crystals remains significantly lower than that of n&#8208;type Bi&#8322;(Te, Se)&#8323; (BTS), and the resulting mismatches hinder effective utilization of its excellent cooling potential. To address this limitation, resonant levels are introduced in the valence bands of hole&#8208;doped SnSe through indium&#8208;doping, which increased the density of states and thereby boosted the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy enable the power factor to reach &#8776;55 &#181;Wcm&#8722;1K&#8722;2 and ZT value of &#8776;1.0 at 300 K, with a more matching Seebeck coefficient of &#8776;211 &#181;VK&#8722;1. Furthermore, a full&#8208;scale thermoelectric cooler incorporating the p&#8208;type SnSe paired with n&#8208;type BTS demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference (&#916;Tmax) of &#8776;81.1 K at 343 K. A SnSe&#8208;based single&#8208;leg device achieve a conversion efficiency of &#8776;7.0% under a &#916;T of 250 K. These findings highlight that matching thermoelectric parameter of p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type materials is crucial for enhancing the cooling efficiency of devices, and engineering resonant energy levels constitutes a robust strategy for solving the inherent performance limitations of p&#8208;type SnSe in practical thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Decoupling Self&#8208;Matching Effect Between Cathode and Anode in Hybrid Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 32, August 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study decouples the effects of cathode&#8208;anode matching and coupling on performance of a system in hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) which are like black boxes. By modulating the three&#8208;electrode mode to focus on the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode potentials ranges, the matching and coupling is correlated with current, providing a guiding principle for predicting and optimizing the performance of HECs based on electrode.








Abstract
Hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HECs) are advanced energy storage devices that offer high energy density, high power density, and long cycle life by integrating the energy storage mechanisms of both batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical coupling resulting from the cathode&#8208;anode kinetic differences severely restricts the accuracy of predicting the performance of HECs based on electrode performance. However, no general method can decouple the effects of cathode&#8208;anode kinetics matching on electrochemical performance by integrating electrochemical coupling from an electrochemical perspective. Here, using an integrated method that combines two distinct three&#8208;electrode testing modes in the typical sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors, the self&#8208;matching effect of cathode&#8208;anode working potential ranges is first refined as the foundation for kinetic matching and electrochemical coupling. The discrepancies and interdependencies in cathode&#8208;anode electrochemical coupling for an individual kinetic match are decoupled by examining the impact of the self&#8208;matching effect on the electrochemical results. The critical matching current density is introduced as a key kinetic parameter for evaluating the degree of cathode&#8208;anode matching in complex electrochemical systems. This advancement provides an innovative design principle for electrode matching and coupling in high&#8208;performance HECs.

Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Moreover, intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling.








Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled by conductive hydrogels exhibit great application potential for their seamless integration with the human body for human&#8208;machine interactions (HMI). However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e&#8208;waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self&#8208;healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200&#160;ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote&#8208;controlling platforms, paving the way for large&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;scenario applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a series of bioprinting techniques, polymer&#8208;based inks, and bioprinted devices are presented for wound healing. Recent advances in this cutting&#8208;edge field, including seven modification strategies of bioprinted devices and the clinical needs they address are summarized and discussed. Several frontiers of bioprinting, challenges, and future directions are highlighted and prospected.








Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroic materials with ultrathin thickness and atomically smooth interface are promising candidates for constructing novel memory devices. This review surveys recent progress and proposes future prospects on 2D ferroic materials for nonvolatile memory applications, including 2D spintronic devices, 2D ferroelectric devices, and 2D multiferroic devices.








Abstract
The emerging nonvolatile memory technologies based on ferroic materials are promising for producing high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory in the field of&#160;integrated circuits. Long&#8208;range ferroic orders observed in 2D materials have triggered extensive research interest in 2D magnets, 2D ferroelectrics, 2D multiferroics, and their device applications. Devices based on 2D ferroic materials and heterostructures with an atomically smooth interface and ultrathin thickness have exhibited impressive properties and significant potential for developing advanced nonvolatile memory. In this context, a systematic review of emergent 2D ferroic materials is conducted here, emphasizing their recent research on nonvolatile memory applications, with a view to proposing brighter prospects for 2D magnetic materials, 2D ferroelectric materials, 2D multiferroic materials, and their relevant devices.

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates eight targeting strategies of functional materials that specifically target subcellular structures in tumor cells, including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgiosome, cytomembrane, and multi&#8208;organelle targeting strategies, and covers a wide range of functional materials, such as liposomes, metal nanoparticles, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, dendrimer nanoplatforms, carbon nanotubes, mitochondria&#8208;targeting mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon QD, amphiphilic copolymers, and small molecular compounds.








Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. The review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Noninvasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper discusses the photothermal properties and biological mechanisms of nanomaterials, emphasizing a clinical and biological perspective. The primary focus is on current research regarding photothermal nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment: nanoparticle materials, breast characteristics, functional design, and commonly used adjuvant therapy in clinical practice.








Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

In this review, the latest developments in nanoporous crystalline materials, including metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) for nucleic acid recognition and applications are discussed. Different strategies for functionalizing these materials are explored to specifically identify nucleic acid targets. Their applications in selective separation and detection of nucleic acids are highlighted. They can also be used as DNA/RNA sensors, gene delivery agents, host DNAzymes, and in DNA&#8208;based computing. Other applications include catalysis, data storage, and biomimetics. The development of novel nanoporous crystalline materials with enhanced biocompatibility has opened up new avenues in the fields of nucleic acid analysis and therapy, paving the way for the development of sensitive, selective, and cost&#8208;effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools with widespread applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intractable oral biofilms are the chief culprits of both dental infections and systemic inflammation, posing a great threat to human health. In this review, core strategies of recently developed biomaterials in eradicating oral biofilm are present. Furthermore, design rationales of biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity, as well as versatile antibiofilm biomaterials with other functions are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly becoming one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs are discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Geometric Control and Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have provided great opportunities for many promising applications. Here, the geometric control and optical properties of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are circumnavigated and widen the scope of their potential applications. It is envisioned that these studies will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for emerging applications.








Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are reviewed with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. Several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels are also discussed. Three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials, including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine, are further highlighted. It is envisioned that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnets provide diverse magnetic orders for spins to be aligned, including intralayer ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and interlayer (A&#8208;type) antiferromagnetism, which allow the spins to precess in a wide range of frequency from GHz to X&#8208;ray. By interacting with the given wavelength of light/electromagnetic wave, the spins can be excited (written) and detected (read), realizing different types of opto&#8208;spintronic devices and functions.








Abstract
Since the emergence of 2D magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional 3D magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8211;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, opto&#8208;spintronics is divided into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: 1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), 2) visible, and 3) UV to X&#8208;rays. It is focused on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduces the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

     alt="A Monolayer High-Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monolayer high-entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co-ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high-entropy material structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high-entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high-entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of AIEgen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks are constructed with a unique &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; functionality, which is not only efficient in directly modulating the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy, but also further inducing browning of white fat and ameliorating the neuroinflammation of peri&#8208;SG, favorable for inhibiting malignant ventricular arrhythmias.








Abstract
The engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF are reported, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. The work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition provides a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Regulating Drug Delivery Nanoparticles for Treating and Preventing Typical Biofilm&#8208;Induced Oral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of the infectious diseases in the oral cavity are based on disturbances in the bacterial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. In this work, a microenvironment&#8208;targeted drug delivery nanoparticle is prepared to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, modulate macrophage polarization, and produce photodynamic and photothermal effects. It performs antibacterial, anti&#8208;biofilm, and anti&#8208;inflammation effects to achieve the treatment and prevention for typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases.








Abstract
The oral cavity comprises an environment full of microorganisms. Dysregulation of this microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment will lead to a series of oral diseases, such as implant&#8208;associated infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms and periodontitis initiated by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis). In this study, a liposome&#8208;encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG) and rapamycin drug&#8208;delivery nanoparticle (ICG&#8208;rapamycin) is designed to treat and prevent two typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. ICG&#8208;rapamycin elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and temperature levels to facilitate photodynamic and photothermal mechanisms under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for anti&#8208;bacteria. In addition, it prevents biofilm formation by promoting bacterial motility with increasing the ATP levels. The nanoparticles modulate the microbial&#8208;cellular interaction to reduce cellular inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance, which includes promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages, upregulating the anti&#8208;inflammatory factor TGF&#8208;&#946;, and enhancing the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages. Based on these findings, ICG&#8208;rapamycin is applied to implant&#8208;infected and periodontitis animal models to confirm the effects in vivo. This study demonstrates that ICG&#8208;rapamycin can treat and prevent biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment, thus providing a promising strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of a Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single&#8208;nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano&#8208;optics, and catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal-nanoparticle-assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single-nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron-beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter-long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape-based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single-nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano-optics, and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) LaOCl is synthesized by controlling the growth kinetics. Due to the considerable dielectric properties of LaOCl and its dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, the MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with vdW LaOCl dielectric exhibits ultralow hysteresis. LaOCl possesses the tremendous potential to act as an ideal gate dielectric for two&#8208;dimensional FETs.








Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high&#8208;mobility 2D semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics are successfully synthesized by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of LaOCl showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed vdW interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. These findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

Properties of LM and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a leading cause of high mortality and imposes a significant health burden globally. The biocompatibility between materials and the cardiovascular system, encompassing biological safety, modulus matching, and anti&#8208;fatigue performance in dynamic physiological environments, has been a critical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. The emergence of liquid metal (LM) offers promising opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods that exhibit excellent biocompatibility with the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, the progress of LM applications in contrast agents, nanomedicine, implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices, and bionic materials is evaluated, providing a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth discussion of the role and advantages of LM in CVDs management. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of LM in the field of CVDs diagnosis and treatment are outlined.

         <title>Routes to Electrochemically Stable Sulfur Cathodes for Practical Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state reaction&#8221; mechanism can enable the redox reaction of sulfur to proceed in a solid&#8208;phase conversion manner in liquid electrolytes without the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates at cycling, and therefore is a promising approach to develop high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable sulfur cathodes for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been investigated intensively as a post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion technology in the past decade; however, their realizable energy density and cycling performance are still far from satisfaction for commercial development. Although many extremely high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable S cathodes and Li anodes are reported in literature, their use for practical Li&#8211;S batteries remains challenging due to the huge gap between the laboratory research and industrial applications. The laboratory research is usually conducted by use of a thin&#8208;film electrode with a low sulfur loading and high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, while the practical batteries require a thick/high sulfur loading cathode and a low E/S ratio to achieve a desired energy density. To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.

Abstract
Promising advances in molecular medicine have promoted the urgent requirement for reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. Electronic biosensing devices based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a wide range of benefits, including rapid and label&#8208;free detection, high sensitivity, easy operation, and capability of integration, possessing significant potential for application in disease screening and health monitoring. In this perspective, the tremendous efforts and achievements in the development of high&#8208;performance FET biosensors in the past decade are summarized, with emphasis on the interface engineering of FET&#8208;based electrical platforms for biomolecule identification. First, an overview of engineering strategies for interface modulation and recognition element design is discussed in detail. For a further step, the applications of FET&#8208;based electrical devices for in vitro detection and real&#8208;time monitoring in biological systems are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the key opportunities and challenges of FET&#8208;based electronic devices in biosensing are discussed. It is anticipated that a comprehensive understanding of interface engineering strategies in FET biosensors will inspire additional techniques for developing highly sensitive, specific, and stable FET biosensors as well as emerging designs for next&#8208;generation biosensing electronics.

         <title>Materials Strategies Tackling Interfacial Issues in Catalyst Layers of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on the latest progresses in material sciences for solving the problems related to the catalyst/ionomer interface in PEMFCs, with particular emphasis put on the effects of materials structures and intermolecular interactions. The content covers catalysts, ionomers, and additives. Based on molecule&#8208;level understanding, the challenges for the application of established materials and opportunities to broaden the material library are proposed.








Abstract
The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical challenge for the large-scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule-level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Processability Considerations for Next&#8208;Generation Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive set of key performance indicators is proposed to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for the processability of organic photovoltaic materials, aiming to guide academic research and enhance industrial processability.








Abstract
The evolution of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has resulted in unforeseen outcomes. This has provided substitute choices of photoactive layer materials, which effectively convert sunlight into electricity. Recently developed OPV materials have narrowed down the gaps in efficiency, stability, and cost in devices. Records now show power conversion efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices closing to 20%. Despite this, there is still a gap between the currently developed OPV materials and those that meet the requirements of practical applications, especially the solution processability issue widely concerned in the field of OPVs. Based on the general rule that structure determines properties, methodologies to enhance the processability of OPV materials are reviewed and explored from the perspective of material design and views&#160;on the further development of processable OPV materials are presented. Considering the current dilemma that the existing evaluation indicators cannot reflect the industrial processability of OPV materials, a more complete set of key performance indicators are proposed&#160;for their processability considerations. The purpose of this perspective is to raise awareness of the boundary conditions that exist in industrial OPV manufacturing and to provide guidance for academic research that aspires to contribute to technological advancements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Topological Phononic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of non&#8208;Hermitian physics is in the ascendant and has brought new opportunities for the development of topological metamaterials. This perspective reviews the recent advances in non&#8208;Hermitian topological phononic metamaterials for acoustic wave and mechanical structures. New configurations and mechanisms for skin effect in high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian systems and non&#8208;Hermitian effect for elastic wave metamaterials are worthy of further exploration.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian (NH) physics describes novel phenomena in open systems that allow generally complex spectra. Introducing NH physics into topological metamaterials, which permits explorations of topological wave phenomena in artificially designed structures, not only enables the experimental verification of exotic NH phenomena in these flexible platforms, but also enriches the manipulation of wave propagation beyond the Hermitian cases. Here, a perspective on the advances in the research of NH topological phononic metamaterials is presented, which covers the exceptional points and their topological geometries, the skin effect related to the topology of complex spectra, the interplay of NH effects and topological states in phononic metamaterials, etc.

         <title>In Situ Twistronics: A New Platform Based on Superlubricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The burgeoning field of twistronics has been ignited by the straightforward manipulation of interlayer twist between van der Waals layered materials. This perspective highlights the in situ twisting techniques and the underlying superlubricity mechanism, and exemplifies new promising opportunities arising from the intersection of the fields of twistronics, nanotribology, and micro/nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc.








Abstract
Twistronics, an emerging field focused on exploring the unique electrical properties induced by twist interface in graphene multilayers, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The general manipulation of twist angle depends on the assembly of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, which has led to the discovery of unconventional superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and nonlinear optics, thereby expanding the realm of twistronics. Recently, in situ tuning of interlayer conductivity in vdW layered materials has been achieved based on scanning probe microscope. In this Perspective, the advancements in in situ twistronics are focused on by reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ manipulating technology, discussing the underlying mechanism based on the concept of structural superlubricity, and exploiting the real&#8208;time twistronic tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is shown that the real&#8208;time manipulation under SEM allows for visualizing and monitoring the interface status during in situ twistronic testing. By harnessing the unique tribological properties of vdW layered materials, this novel platform not only enhances the fabrication of twistronic devices but also facilitates the fundamental understanding of interface phenomena in vdW layered materials. Moreover, this platform holds great promise for the application of twistronic&#8208;mechanical systems, providing avenues for the integration of twistronics into various mechanical frameworks.
