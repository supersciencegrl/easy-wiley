         <title>Concurrent Ammonia Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation Boosted by Glutathione&#8208;Capped Quantum Dots under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Mother nature accomplishes efficient ammonia synthesis via cascade N2 oxidation by lightning strikes followed with enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen oxyanion (NOx&#8722;, x = 2,3) reduction. The protein environment of enzymatic centers for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process greatly inspires the design of glutathione&#8208;capped (GSH) quantum dots (QDs) for ammonia synthesis under visible light (440&#160;nm) in tandem with plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation. Mechanistic studies reveal that GSH induces positive shift of surface charge to strengthen the interaction between NOx&#8722; and QDs. Upon visible light irradiation of QDs, the balanced and rapid hole and electron transfer furnish GS&#11825; radicals for 2e&#8722;/2H+ alcohol oxidation and H&#11825; for 8e&#8722;/10H+ NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ reduction simultaneously. For the first time, mmol&#8208;scale ammonia synthesis is realized with apparent quantum yields of 5.45&#177; 0.64%, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of value&#8208;added acetophenone and NH4Cl proceeds with 1:4 stoichiometry and stability, demonstrating promising multielectron and multiproton ammonia synthesis efficiency and sustainability with nature&#8208;inspired artificial photocatalysts.

         <title>Structural Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Enhancing Petrochemical Catalytic Reaction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Petroleum, as the &#8220;lifeblood&#8221; of industrial development, is the important energy source and raw material. The selective transformation of petroleum into high&#8208;end chemicals is of great significance, but still exists enormous challenges. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites, promise a broad application in petrochemical processes. Herein, the research systematically summarizes the recent research progress of SACs in petrochemical catalytic reaction, proposes the role of structural design of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates the catalytic reaction mechanisms of SACs in the conversion of petrochemical processes, and reveals the high activity origins of SACs at the atomic scale. Finally, we summarize the key challenges and provide an outlook on the design, identification of active sites and the appropriate application of artificial intelligence technology for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs in petrochemical process.

         <title>Large&#8208;scale, Stretchable, Self&#8208;protective, and Multifunctional Perovskite Luminescent Filament with Ultra&#8208;high Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lead halide perovskites possess great application potential in flexible displays and wearable optoelectronics owing to their prominent optoelectronic properties. However, the intrinsic instability upon moisture, heat, and ultraviolet light irradiation hinders their development and application. In this work, an ultra&#8208;stable CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite luminescent filament (PLF) with high stretchability (&#8764;2400%) and luminescence is introduced by a facile environmental&#8208;friendly wet&#8208;spinning technology via solvent extraction (with a high production rate of 0.7 m/min and low cost of 1.56 USD per 100 m). The CsPbX3 PLF displays homogeneous luminescence (photoluminescence quantum yield of 24.5%), tunable emission spectrum, and high color purity. Benefiting from the in&#8208;situ encapsulation effect of the hydrophobic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and the chelation of the Lewis base C = O in TPU with the Lewis acid Pb2+, the CsPbBr3 PLF demonstrates ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence (PL) stability when stored in ambient air and high humidity circumstance, annealed at 50&#160;&#176;C, and dipped in water for 30 d, illuminated under ultraviolet light for 300&#160;min, and immersed in organic solvents and solutions with pH of 1&#8211;13 for 5&#160;min, respectively. Impressively, it retains 80% of its initial PL after being recycled 5 times. Overall, the CsPbX3 PLF demonstrates promising prospects in multifunctional applications, including organic dyes and tensile strain sensing, flexible pattern displays, secondary anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and hazard warning systems.

         <title>Achieving Zero&#8208;Temperature Coefficient Point Behavior by Defect Passivation for Temperature&#8208;Immune Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have broad prospects in biomedical, sensor, and aerospace applications. However, obtaining temperature&#8208;immune OFETs is difficult because the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are temperature&#8208;sensitive. The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior can be used to achieve a temperature&#8208;immune output current; however, it is difficult to achieve in organic devices with thermal activation characteristics, according to the existing ZTC point theory. Here, we eliminate the Fermi pinning in OSCs using the defect passivation strategy, making the Fermi level closer to the tail state at low temperatures; thus threshold voltage (VT) is negatively correlated with temperature. ZTC&#8208;point behaviors in OFETs are achieved by compensation between VT and mobility at different temperatures to improve its A temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in a variable&#8208;temperature bias voltage test over 50000 s by biasing the device at the ZTC point. This study provides an effective solution for temperature&#8208;immune OFETs and inspiration for their practical application.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant exchange gap fluctuation has been discovered in a five&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin film using scanning tunneling microscopy. By applying a 1T out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, the gap fluctuation can be reduced. These findings provide valuable insight into the breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), revealing that magnetic disorder in odd&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin films must be overcome in order to realize QAHE at higher temperatures.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators transport charge without resistance along topologically protected chiral 1D edge states. Yet, in magnetic topological insulators to date, topological protection is far from robust, with zero&#8208;magnetic field QAH effect only realized at temperatures an order of magnitude below the N&#233;el temperature TN, though small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological protection breaks down is therefore essential to realizing QAH effect at higher temperatures. Here a scanning tunneling microscope is used to directly map the size of exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH insulator 5&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4. Long&#8208;range fluctuations of Eg,ex are observed, with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, appearing to be uncorrelated to individual surface point defects. The breakdown of topological protection is directly imaged, showing that the gapless edge state, the hallmark signature of a QAH insulator, hybridizes with extended gapless regions in the bulk. Finally, it is unambiguously demonstrated that the gapless regions originate from magnetic disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields. The results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is the key to exploiting the unique properties of QAH insulators.

         <title>Materials and Strategies to Enhance Melt Electrowriting Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports on Melt Electrowriting as an innovative additive manufacturing technology enabling precise deposition of polymeric microfibers with vast potential across diverse fields. It delves into the extensive range of materials already processed by this technique, alongside various explored postprocessing methods and its integration with other technologies, aiming to broaden its applicability and impact.








Abstract
Melt electrowriting (MEW) is an emerging additive manufacturing (AM) technology that enables the precise deposition of continuous polymeric microfibers, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;resolution constructs. In recent years, MEW has undergone a revolution, with the introduction of active properties or additional functionalities through novel polymer processing strategies, the incorporation of functional fillers, postprocessing, or the combination with other techniques. While extensively explored in biomedical applications, MEW's potential in other fields remains untapped. Thus, this review explores MEW's characteristics from a materials science perspective, emphasizing the diverse range of materials and composites processed by this technique and their current and potential applications. Additionally, the prospects offered by postprinting processing techniques are explored, together with the synergy achieved by combining melt electrowriting with other manufacturing methods. By highlighting the untapped potentials of MEW, this review aims to inspire research groups across various fields to leverage this technology for innovative endeavors.

         <title>In&#8208;Operando Spatiotemporal Imaging of Coupled Film&#8208;Substrate Elastodynamics During an Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising coherently coupled elastodynamics is observed between a VO2 film exhibiting an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) and a TiO2 substrate that &#160; also exhibits an IMT&#8208;like response in a micrometers deep surface layer, reveals by spatiotemporal X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy. Phase&#8208;field model points to native oxygen vacancy defects that respond to electric fields, a promising direction for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The drive toward non&#8208;von Neumann device architectures has led to an intense focus on insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal (IMT) and the converse metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator (MIT) transitions. Studies of electric field&#8208;driven IMT in the prototypical VO2 thin&#8208;film channel devices are largely focused on the electrical and elastic responses of the films, but the response of the corresponding TiO2 substrate is often overlooked, since it is nominally expected to be electrically passive and elastically rigid. Here, in&#8208;operando spatiotemporal imaging of the coupled elastodynamics using X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy of a VO2 film channel device on TiO2 substrate reveals two new surprises. First, the film channel bulges during the IMT, the opposite of the expected shrinking in the film undergoing IMT. Second, a microns thick proximal layer in the substrate also coherently bulges accompanying the IMT in the film, which is completely unexpected. Phase&#8208;field simulations of coupled IMT, oxygen vacancy electronic dynamics, and electronic carrier diffusion incorporating thermal and strain effects suggest that the observed elastodynamics can be explained by the known naturally occurring oxygen vacancies that rapidly ionize (and deionize) in concert with the IMT (MIT). Fast electrical&#8208;triggering of the IMT via ionizing defects and an active &#8220;IMT&#8208;like&#8221; substrate layer are critical aspects to consider in device applications.

         <title>Exosome&#8208;Inhibiting Polymeric Sonosensitizer for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) is designed for combination sono&#8208;immunotherapy, triggering tumor immunogenic cell death under ultrasound irradiation and inhibiting tumor exosome generation upon activation by tumor biomarker.








Abstract
Combination cancer immunotherapy based on electromagnetic energy and immunotherapy shows potent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy. However, as a factor that mediates tumor metastasis and immune suppression, the impact of tumor exosomes on therapy under electromagnetic energy stimulation remains unclear. Herein, findings indicate that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) increases serum exosome levels by inducing apoptotic exosomes and loosening the tumor extracellular matrix, promoting lung metastasis. To address this problem, an exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) selectively inhibiting tumor exosome generation in response to the tumor biomarker is synthesized. EIPS consists of a semiconducting polymer backbone capable of inducing SDT and a poly(ethylene glycol) layer conjugated with a tumor&#8208;specific enzyme&#8208;responsive exosome inhibitor prodrug. After being cleaved by tumor Cathepsin B, EIPS releases active exosome inhibitors, preventing tumor exosome&#8208;mediated immune suppression and lung metastasis. As a result, EIPS elicits robust antitumor effects through the synergistic effect of SDT and tumor exosome inhibition, completely preventing lung metastasis and establishing a long&#8208;term immune memory effect. This is the first example showing that combining SDT with tumor&#8208;specific exosome inhibition can elicit a potent immune response without the help of typical immune agonists.

         <title>Microalgae&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Associated Anxiety and Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral microalgae&#8208;based hydrogel is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease and its associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. The hydrogel can reduce intestinal inflammation, maintain intestinal homeostasis, and inhibit neuroinflammation, then significantly alleviate the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the etiology of psychiatric disorders associated with IBD remains uncertain, and an efficacious treatment approach has yet to be established. Herein, an oral hydrogel strategy (SP@Rh&#8208;gel) is proposed for co&#8208;delivery of Spirulina platensis and rhein to treat IBD and IBD&#8208;associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. SP@Rh&#8208;gel improves the solubility, release characteristics and intestinal retention capacity of the drug, leading to a significant improvement in the oral therapeutic efficacy. Oral administration of SP@Rh&#8208;gel can reduce intestinal inflammation and rebalance the disrupted intestinal microbial community. Furthermore, SP@Rh&#8208;gel maintains intestinal barrier integrity and reduces the release of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and their entry into the hippocampus through the blood&#8208;brain barrier, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining neuroplasticity. SP@Rh&#8208;gel significantly alleviates the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors, in a chronic colitis mouse model. This study demonstrates the significant involvement of the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis in the development of IBD with psychiatric disorders and proposes a safe, simple, and highly efficient therapeutic approach for managing IBD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Radiative cooling (RC) is a carbon&#8208;neutral cooling technology that utilizes thermal radiation to dissipate heat from the Earth's surface to the cold outer space. Research in the field of RC has garnered increasing interest from both academia and industry due to its potential to drive sustainable economic and environmental benefits to human society by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from conventional cooling systems. Materials innovation is the key to fully exploit the potential of RC. This review aims to elucidate the materials development with a focus on the design strategy including their intrinsic properties, structural formations, and performance improvement. The main types of RC materials, i.e., static&#8208;homogeneous, static&#8208;composite, dynamic, and multifunctional materials, are systematically overviewed. Future trends, possible challenges, and potential solutions are presented with perspectives in the concluding part, aiming to provide a roadmap for the future development of advanced RC materials.

         <title>An Electro&#8208;optical Kerr Device Based on 2D Boron Nitride Liquid Crystals for Solar&#8208;blind Communications</title>

Abstract
Achieving light modulation in the spectral range of 200 &#8211; 280&#160;nm is a prerequisite for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet communication, where current technologies mainly based on the electro&#8208;luminescent self&#8208;modulation of the ultraviolet source. External light modulation through the electro&#8208;birefringence control of liquid crystal devices has shown success in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared regions. However, the poor stability of conventional liquid crystals against ultraviolet irradiation and their weak electro&#8208;optical response make it challenging to modulate ultraviolet light. Here, we demonstrate an external ultraviolet light modulator using two&#8208;dimensional boron nitride liquid crystal. It exhibits robust ultraviolet stability and a record&#8208;high specific electro&#8208;optical Kerr coefficient of 5.1&#215;10&#8722;2 m V&#8722;2, being three orders of magnitude higher than those of other known electro&#8208;optical media that are transparent (or potentially transparent) in the ultraviolent spectral range. The sensitive response enables us to fabricate transmissive and stable UV&#8208;C electro&#8208;optical Kerr modulators for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet light. We also demonstrate an M&#8208;ary coding array with high transmission density for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet communication.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel&#8208;Functionalized Photothermal Sponge Enables Simultaneously Continuous Solar Desalination and Electricity Generation without Salt Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Technologies that can simultaneously generate electricity and desalinate seawater are highly attractive and required to meet the increasing global demand for power and clean water. Here we develop a bifunctional solar evaporator that features continuous electric generation in seawater without salt accumulation by rational design of polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits an unprecedentedly high water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg&#8226;m&#8722;2&#8226;h&#8722;1along with 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency, but also can uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#956;A&#8226;cm&#8722;2 in high&#8208;concentration brine over a prolonged period under one sun irradiation. Many common electronic devices can be driven by simply connecting evaporator units in series or in parallel without any other auxiliaries. Different from the previously proposed power generation mechanism, our study reveals that the water&#8208;enabled proton concentration fields in intermediate water region can also induce an additional ion electric field in free water region containing solute to further enhance electricity output. Given the low&#8208;cost materials, simple self&#8208;regeneration design, scalable fabrication processes and stable performance, this work offers a promising strategy for addressing the shortages of clean water and sustainable electricity.

         <title>Tailoring Perovskite Surface Potential and Chelation Advances Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of spatial symmetry on device performance is investigated by using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and comprehensive chelation compared to the asymmetrical CEA+ cations. This strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 25.60%.








Abstract
Modifying perovskite surface using various organic ammonium halide cations has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the impact of the structural symmetry of these ammonium halide cations on perovskite interface termination has remained uncertain. Here, this work investigates the influence of symmetry on the performance of the devices, using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and hole transport layer. These results reveal that the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and more comprehensive chelation with uncoordinated Pb2+ compared to the asymmetrical cations, resulting in a more favorable energy band alignment and strengthened defect healing. This strategy, leveraging the spatial geometrical symmetry of the interface cations, promotes hole carrier extraction between functional layers and reduces nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. Consequently, perovskite solar cells processed with the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.60% and retain &#8776;91% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point operation. This work highlights the significant benefits of utilizing structurally symmetrical cations in promoting the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Junctionless Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Device Using 2D Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Layered Materials for Ternary Parallel Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) device featuring a junctionless vdW channel. The approach for inducing the NDR phenomenon revolves around selectively inhibiting carrier transport, a result accomplished by creating a partial potential barrier within the junctionless channel. To showcase the utility of the junctionless NDR device for a ternary hardware neural network, its practical application is presented by configuring ternary logic circuits.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) devices offer a promising pathway for developing future computing technologies characterized by exceptionally low energy consumption, especially multivalued logic computing. Nevertheless, conventional approaches aimed at attaining the NDR phenomenon involve intricate junction configurations and/or external doping processes in the channel region, impeding the progress of NDR devices to the circuit and system levels. Here, an NDR device is presented that incorporates a channel without junctions. The NDR phenomenon is achieved by introducing a metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor capacitor to a portion of the channel area. This approach establishes partial potential barrier and well that effectively restrict the movement of hole and electron carriers within specific voltage ranges. Consequently, this facilitates the implementation of both a ternary inverter and a ternary static&#8208;random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, which are essential components in the development of multivalued logic computing technology.

         <title>Full&#8208;Length Single Protein Molecules Tracking and Counting in Thin Silicon Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid full&#8208;length, single protein molecules separation, tracking, and identification in ultra&#8208;high aspect ratio silicon devices. Proteins are tagged by chemo&#8208;selective dual amino&#8208;acid specific labels and are electrophoretically separated by their mass/charge in custom thin silicon channel with subwavelength height. This approach allows the analysis of thousands of individual proteins within a few minutes by tracking their motion during the migration.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;molecule protein sensing techniques are ushering in a transformative era in biomedical research.

Here, a single&#8208;molecule method for parallel protein separation and tracking is introduced, yielding multi&#8208;dimensional molecular properties used for their identification.

Being non&#8208;destructive and compatible with full&#8208;length intact proteins, this method opens up ways for antibody&#8208;free single&#8208;protein molecule quantification.

         <title>Insect&#8208;Scale Biped Robots Based on Asymmetrical Friction Effect Induced by Magnetic Torque</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque has been revealed and defined. A biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise motions along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling.








Abstract
Multimodal and controllable locomotion in complex terrain is of great importance for practical applications of insect&#8208;scale robots. Robust locomotion plays a particularly critical role. In this study, a locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque is revealed and defined. The defined mechanism overcomes the design constraints imposed by both robot and substrate structures, enabling the realization of multimodal locomotion on complex terrains. Drawing inspiration from human walking and running locomotion, a biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise locomotion along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling. Furthermore, apart from its exceptional locomotive capabilities, the biped robot demonstrates remarkable robustness in terms of load&#8208;carrying and weight&#8208;bearing performance. The presented locomotion and mechanism herein introduce a novel concept for designing magnetic robots while offering extensive possibilities for practical applications in insect&#8208;scale robotics.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Suppression with Long Chain Diammonium Alkane for High Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the residual of solvent in unannealed perovskite&#160;film by introducing octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide. This helps to achieve single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells with high efficiency &gt;22% and outstanding stability, and achieve high performance 4&#8208;terminal all perovskite and large area perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite can construct tandem cells with narrow bandgap solar cells by adjusting the band gap to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limitation of single junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, WBG perovskites still suffer from severe nonradiative carrier recombination and large open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. Here, this work uses an in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurement to monitor the intermediate phase evolution and crystallization process via blade coating. This work reports a strategy to fabricate efficient and stable WBG perovskite solar cells through doping a long carbon chain molecule octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide (ODADI). It is found that ODADI doping not only suppresses intermediate phases but also promote the crystallization of perovskite and passivate defects in blade coated 1.67&#160;eV WBG FA0.7Cs0.25MA0.05Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite films. As a result, the champion single junction inverted PSCs deliver the efficiencies of 22.06% and 19.63% for the active area of 0.07 and 1.02 cm2, respectively, which are the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in WBG PSCs by blade coating. The unencapsulated device demonstrates excellent stability in air, which maintains its initial efficiency at the maximum power points under constant AM 1.5G illumination in open air for nearly 500&#160;h. The resulting semitransparent WBG device delivers a high PCE of 20.06%, and the 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device delivers a PCE of 28.35%.

         <title>A Freestanding, Dissolution&#8208; and Diffusion&#8208;Limiting, Flexible Sulfur Electrode Enables High Specific Capacity at High Mass Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize a practically battery with high energy density, it is crucial to achieve stable and high&#8208;loading S electrodes (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). A freestanding electrode with dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions is introduced for flexible Li&#8211;S batteries. This design offers an unconventional improvement in specific capacity at higher mass loading, excellent cycling stability, and remarkable energy density.








Abstract
The acquisition of stable and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity S cathodes over 10&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 is a critical and indispensable step to realize the high energy density configuration. However, increasing the areal capacity of S cathodes often deteriorates the specific capacity and stability due to the aggravated dissolution of S and diffusion of solvable polysulfides in the thick electrode. Herein, the design of a freestanding composite cathode that leverages 3D covalent binding sites and chemical adsorption environment to offer dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions of S species is reported. By employing this architecture, the coin cell exhibits excellent cycling stability and an exceptional specific capacity of 1444.3&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (13&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2), and the pouch cell configuration manifests a noteworthy areal capacity exceeding 11&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. This performance is coupled with excellent flexibility, demonstrated through consecutive bending cycle tests, even at a sulfur loading of 9.00&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This study lays the foundation for the development of flexible Li&#8211;S batteries with increased loading capacities and exceptional performance.

         <title>Rational Design of Organic Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen and Oxygen Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of organic electrocatalysts is proposed including classifying all kinds of organic electrocatalysts into four types and identifying indicators/descriptors of electrocatalytic activities based on their influence on four fundamental electrochemical characteristics determining the overall performance of electrocatalysis. Moreover, five strategies for fully revealing the original electrocatalytic activity and stability of organic electrocatalyst in practical applications are also concluded.








Abstract

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Formation of Pt&#8208;Based Intermetallics on MXene with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ti3C2Tx features plentiful surface terminations and abundant oxygen vacancies, which can electrostatically adsorb metal cations and provide channels to induce the interdiffusion of Pt/Fe atoms, synthesizing the ordered PtFe with small particle sizes. The strong metal&#8208;support interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx can induce the charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti and enhance electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The Pt&#8208;based alloys can moderate the binding energies of oxygenated species on the catalytic surface, endowing the superior catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, it is still challenging to explore general methods to synthesize structurally ordered intermetallics with uniform distributions. Herein, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction is employed to facilitate the interdiffusion of Pt/M atoms by establishing a tunnel of oxygen vacancy on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx (MXene) sheets, synthesizing the ordered PtFe, PtCo, PtZn, PdFe, PdZn intermetallics loaded onto Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ generation of Ti&#8211;O from Ti3C2Tx could be bonded with Pt and forming Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti, resulting in charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the valuable charge redistribution can be observed at the interface and extended even to at the distance of two nanometers from the interface, which can modulate the Pt&#8211;Pt distance, optimize Pt&#8211;O binding energy and enhance intrinsic activity towards ORR. The strong coupling interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx containing the titanium oxide layer endows the high stability of the composites. This work not only presents a general synthesis strategy for intermetallics but also provides a new insight that metal&#8208;support interaction is essential for the structural evolution of intermetallics on materials with oxygen vacancies.

         <title>From Fluorescence&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Lightening&#8208;Printing&#8208;Assisted Conductive Adhesive Nanocomposite Hydrogels toward Wearable Interactive Optical Information&#8208;Electronic Strain Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink onto a conductive adhesive resilient nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed which can achieve body&#8208;joint&#8208;movement&#8208;mediated strain&#8208;dependent fluorescent information and electrical signal changes.








Abstract
The interactive flexible device, which monitors the human motion in optical and electrical synergistic modes, has attracted growing attention recently. The incorporation of information attribute within the optical signal is deemed advantageous for improving the interactive efficiency. Therefore, the development of wearable optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensors holds substantial promise, but integrating and synergizing various functions and realizing strain&#8208;mediated information transformation keep challenging. Herein, an amylopectin (AP) modified nanoclay/polyacrylamide&#8208;based nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel and an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink are fabricated. Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of the ink onto the hydrogel film in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive fluorescent information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed. In the sensor, the nanoclay plays a synergistic &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;three&#8208;birds&#8221; role, contributing to &#8220;lightening&#8221; fluorescence (&#8776;80 times emission intensity enhancement), ionic conductivity, and excellent stretchability (&gt;1000%). The sensor has high biocompatibility, resilience (elastic recovery ratio: 97.8%), and strain sensitivity (gauge factor (GF): 10.9). Additionally, the AP endows the sensor with skin adhesiveness. The sensor can achieve electrical monitoring of human joint movements while displaying interactive fluorescent information transformation. This research poses an efficient strategy to develop multifunctional materials and provides a general platform for achieving next&#8208;generation interactive devices with prospective applications in wearable devices, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Living Synthelectronics: A New Era for Bioelectronics Powered by Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of hybrid electronics combining genetically edited living organisms with nonliving bioelectronics, which is defined as living synthelectronics, is emerging recently. They use engineered cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power source and show many unique properties such as intrinsic self&#8208;healing and dynamic programming ability. The living synthelectronics is expected to provide new possibilities for future bioelectronics.








Abstract
Bioelectronics, which converges biology and electronics, has attracted great attention due to their vital applications in human&#8211;machine interfaces. While traditional bioelectronic devices utilize nonliving organic and/or inorganic materials to achieve flexibility and stretchability, a biological mismatch is often encountered because human tissues are characterized not only by softness and stretchability but also by biodynamic and adaptive properties. Recently, a notable paradigm shift has emerged in bioelectronics, where living cells, and even viruses, modified via gene editing within synthetic biology, are used as core components in a new hybrid electronics paradigm. These devices are defined as &#8220;living synthelectronics,&#8221; and they offer enhanced potential for interfacing with human tissues at informational and substance exchange levels. In this Perspective, the recent advances in living synthelectronics are summarized. First, opportunities brought to electronics by synthetic biology are briefly introduced. Then, strategic approaches to designing and making electronic devices using living cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power sources are reviewed. Finally, the challenges faced by living synthelectronics are raised. It is believed that this paradigm shift will significantly contribute to the real integration of bioelectronics with human tissues.

         <title>Unveiling the Synergistic Role of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Ni/NiOx Photothermal Cocatalyst for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density oxygen (VO) and nickel (VNi) vacancies are formed at the interface of Ni/NiOx encapsulated in graphitized carbon (Ni/NiOx@C) due to the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during polycrystalline annealing. These vacancies establish highly active frustrated Lewis pairs, which significantly enhance the processes of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the defect&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in Ni/NiOx@C facilitates efficient photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;density and closely spaced frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) is crucial for enhancing catalyst activity and accelerating reaction rates. However, constructing efficient FLPs by breaking classical Lewis bonds poses a significant challenge. Here, this work has made a pivotal discovery regarding the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the formation of grain boundaries in carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni/NiOx (Ni/NiOx@C). This effect facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density O (VO) and Ni (VNi) vacancy sites with different charge polarities, specifically FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C basic sites and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C acidic sites. The synergistic interaction between FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C sites not only reduces energy barriers for water adsorption and splitting, but also induces a strong photothermal effect. This mutually reinforcing effect contributes to the exceptional performance of Ni/NiOx@C as a cocatalyst in photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production. Notably, the Ni/NiOx@C/g&#8208;C3N4 (NOCC) composite photocatalyst exhibits remarkable hydrogen production activity with a rate of 10.7 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing that of the Pt cocatalyst by 1.76 times. Moreover, the NOCC achieves an impressive apparent quantum yield of 40.78% at a wavelength of 380&#160;nm. This work paves the way for designing novel defect&#8208;state multiphase cocatalysts with high&#8208;density and adjacent FLP sites, which hold promise for enhancing various catalytic reactions.

&lt;p&gt;High-density oxygen (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) and nickel (V&lt;sub&gt;Ni&lt;/sub&gt;) vacancies are formed at the interface of Ni/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; encapsulated in graphitized carbon (Ni/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C) due to the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during polycrystalline annealing. These vacancies establish highly active frustrated Lewis pairs, which significantly enhance the processes of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the defect-induced nonradiative recombination in Ni/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C facilitates efficient photothermal-assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of high-density and closely spaced frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) is crucial for enhancing catalyst activity and accelerating reaction rates. However, constructing efficient FLPs by breaking classical Lewis bonds poses a significant challenge. Here, this work has made a pivotal discovery regarding the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the formation of grain boundaries in carbon-encapsulated Ni/NiOx (Ni/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C).

This mutually reinforcing effect contributes to the exceptional performance of Ni/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C as a cocatalyst in photothermal-assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Lattice Plainification Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance of P&#8208;Type PbSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe crystals by enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification, leading to promising power generation and thermoelectric cooling performance in p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se&#8208;based devices. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and will motivate more research on developing new thermoelectric coolers.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics has applications in power generation and refrigeration. Since only commercial Bi2Te3 has a low abundance Te, PbSe gets attention. This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe through enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification. Composition controlled and Cu&#8208;doped p&#8208;type PbSe crystals are grown through physical vapor deposition. Results exhibit an enhanced carrier mobility &#8776;2578&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se. Microstructure characterization and density functional theory calculations verify the introduced Cu atoms filled Pb vacancies, realizing lattice plainification and enhancing the carrier mobility. The Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se sample achieves a power factor &#8776;42&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 and a ZT &#8776; 0.7 at 300&#160;K. The average ZT of it reaches &#8776;0.9 (300&#8211;573&#160;K), resulting in a single&#8208;leg power generation efficiency of 7.1% at temperature difference of 270&#160;K, comparable to that of p&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3. A 7&#8208;pairs device paired the p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se with the n&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3 shows a maximum cooling temperature difference &#8776;42&#160;K with the hot side at 300&#160;K, &#8776;65% of that of the commercial Bi2Te3 device. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and hope to inspire researchers on replacing commercial Bi2Te3.

         <title>Sequentially Processed Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction&#8208;Buried Structure for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with 500&#160;nm Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;heterojunction is buried into layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structures to realize decent vertical phase distribution and sufficient exciton dissociation interfaces simultaneously. This scheme possesses efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% in organic solar cells with 500&#8208;nm&#8208;thick active layers.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area printing fabrication is a distinctive feature of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the advance of upscalable fabrication is challenged by the thickness of organic active layers considering the importance of both exciton dissociation and charge collection. In this work, a bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;buried (buried&#8208;BHJ) structure is introduced by sequential deposition to realize efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, thereby contributing to efficient OSCs with 500&#160;nm thick active layers. The buried&#8208;BHJ distributes donor and acceptor phases in the vertical direction as charge transport channels, while numerous BHJ interfaces are buried in each phase to facilitate exciton dissociation simultaneously. It is found that buried&#8208;BHJ configurations possess efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in reduced recombination losses. In comparison with traditional structures, the buried&#8208;BHJ structure displays a decent tolerance to film thickness. In particular, a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% is achieved with active layers at a thickness of 500&#160;nm. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this represents the champion efficiency of thick film OSCs.

Abstract
Nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches are promising for the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which present significant clinical burdens and challenges, but their clinical translation requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between nanotechnology and MSK biology. Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC) systems have emerged as an innovative and versatile microphysiological platform to replicate the dynamics of tissue microenvironment for studying nanotechnology&#8208;biology interactions. This review covers first recent advances and applications of MSK OoCs and their ability to mimic the biophysical and biochemical stimuli encountered by MSK tissues. Next, by integrating nanotechnology into MSK OoCs, cellular responses and tissue behaviors may be investigated by precisely controlling and manipulating the nanoscale environment. Analysis of MSK disease mechanisms, particularly bone, joint, and muscle tissue degeneration, and drug screening and development of personalized medicine may be greatly facilitated using MSK OoCs. Finally, we outline future challenges and directions for the field, including advanced sensing technologies, integration of immune&#8208;active components, and enhancement of biomimetic functionality. By highlighting the emerging applications of MSK OoCs, this review aims to advance our understanding of the intricate nanotechnology&#8208;MSK biology interface and its significance in MSK disease management, and the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic and interventional strategies.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks toward Advanced Zinc&#8211;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc&#8211;based batteries (ZBBs) have demonstrated considerable potential among secondary batteries, attributing to their advantages including good safety, environmental friendliness, and high energy density. However, ZBBs still suffer from issues such as the formation of zinc dendrites, occurrence of side reactions, retardation of reaction kinetics, and shuttle effects, posing a great challenge for practical applications. As promising porous materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives have rigid skeletons, ordered structures, and permanent porosity, which endow them with great potential for application in ZBBs. This review, therefore, provides a systematic overview detailing on COFs structure pertaining to electrochemical performance of ZBBs, following an in&#8211;depth discussion of the challenges faced by ZBBs, which includes dendrites and side reactions at the anode, as well as dissolution, structural change, slow kinetics and shuttle effect at the cathode. Then, the structural advantages of COF&#8211;correlated materials and their roles in various ZBBs are highlighted. Finally, the challenges in the application of COF&#8211;correlated materials in ZBBs are outlined and an outlook on the future development of COF&#8211;correlated materials for using in ZBBs is provided. The review would serve as a valuable reference for further research into the utilization of COF&#8211;correlated materials in ZBBs.

         <title>Tunnel&#8208;Oriented VO2 (B) Cathode for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxides are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, unlike layer&#8208;type cathodes with adjustable layer distances, enhancing ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnels characterized by fixed sizes poses a considerable challenge. This study highlights that the macroscopic arrangement of the electrode crucially determines tunnel orientation, thereby influencing the ion transport. By changing the material morphology, the tunnel orientation can be optimized to facilitate rapid ion diffusion. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, it is revealed that (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts with dispersive morphology (VO2&#8208;D) tend to adopt a stacking pattern with directional ion transport along the c&#8208;axis on the electrode and guarantee fast ion diffusion. Compared with the aggregated sample (VO2&#8208;A) that tends to random arrangement on the electrode with isotropic and slow ion transfer behavior, the electrode featuring dispersive (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts displays directional and fast ion diffusion behavior, thus exhibits an ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (420.8 and 344.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 10.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively) and long cycling stability (84.3% capacity retention under 5000 cycles at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). The results suggest that simultaneous manipulation of exposed crystal facet and morphology&#8208;related electrode arrangement should be promising for boosting the ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxide cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;Tunnel-type vanadium oxides are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, unlike layer-type cathodes with adjustable layer distances, enhancing ion-transport kinetics in tunnels characterized by fixed sizes poses a considerable challenge.

         <title>On&#8208;demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspired the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make drying&#8208;induced cracks. We explore the controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF). The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Derived, Hetero&#8208;Structured, Pro&#8208;Healing Bioadhesive Patch for High&#8208;Performance Sealing of Wet Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising alternatives to sutures and staples to achieve wound closure and hemostasis. However, they often do not work well on tissues that are soaked in blood or other biological fluids, and organs that are typically exposed to a variety of harsh environments, such as different pH values, nonhomogeneous distortions, continuous expansions and contractions, or high pressures. In this study, we developed a nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the skin secretion of SSAD, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is successfully applied for the sealing and healing of tissue defects within 10 s in diverse extreme injury scenarios in vivo, including rat stomach perforation, small intestine perforation, fetal membrane defect, porcine carotid artery incision, and lung lobe laceration. Our findings reveal a promising new type of self&#8208;adhesive regenerative SSAD&#8208;Patch, which is potentially adaptable to broad applications (under different pH values and air or liquid pressures) in sutureless wound sealing and healing.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft electronics are garnering significant attention due to their wide&#8208;ranging applications in artificial skin, health monitoring, human&#8208;machine interaction, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Various soft physical sensors such as mechanical sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors are the fundamental building blocks for soft electronics. While the fast growth and widespread utilization of electronic devices have elevated the life quality, the consequential electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radiation pose potential threats to device precision and human health. Another substantial concern pertains to overheating issues that occur during prolonged operation. Therefore, the design of multifunctional soft electronics exhibiting excellent capabilities in sensing, EMI shielding, and thermal management is of paramount importance. Because of the prominent advantages in chemical stability, electrical and thermal conductivity, and easy functionalization, new carbon materials including carbon nanotubes, graphene and its derivatives, graphdiyne, and sustainable natural&#8208;biomass derived carbon are particularly promising candidates for multifunctional soft electronics. This review summarizes the latest advancements in multifunctional soft electronics based on new carbon materials across a range of performance aspects, mainly focusing on the structure or composite design, and fabrication method on the physical signals monitoring, EMI shielding, and thermal management. Furthermore, the device integration strategies and corresponding intriguing applications are highlighted. Finally, this review presents prospects aimed at overcoming current barriers and advancing the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional soft electronics.

         <title>Single Atom Catalysts Remodel Tumor Microenvironment for Augmented Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a huge hurdle in immunotherapy. Sono&#8208;immunotherapy is a new treatment modality that can reverse immunosuppressive TME, but the sonodynamic effects are compromised by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in the TME. Herein we report a new sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy using Pd&#948;+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono&#8208;suppressive TME. To demonstrate this technique, we employed rich and reductive Ti vacancies in Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty nanosheets to construct the atomically dispersed Pd&#8208;C3 single atom catalysts (SAC) with Pd content up to 2.5 wt% (PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty). Compared with Pd nanoparticle loaded Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty, PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty single&#8208;atom enzyme showed augmented sonodynamic effects that are ascribed to SAC facilitated electron&#8208;hole separation, rapid depletion of overexpressed GSH by US excited holes, and catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 for relieving hypoxia. Importantly, the sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy can boost abscopal antitumor immune responses by driving maturation of dendritic cells and polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages into the anti&#8208;tumoral M1 phenotype. Bilateral tumor models demonstrated the complete eradication of localized tumors and enhanced metastatic regression. Our strategy highlights the potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts for robust sono&#8208;immunotherapy by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Polymerization of Dendritic Agents for Hijacking Lysosomes and Enhancing Antigen Presentation in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A low generation lysine dendrimer, SPr&#8208;G2, responds to intracellular glutathione to initiate bioorthogonal in situ polymerization, resulting in the formation of large assemblies in mouse breast cancer cells. The intracellular large assemblies of SPr&#8208;G2 can interact with lysosomes to induce lysosome expansion and enhance lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), leading to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) upregulation on tumor cell surfaces and ultimately tumor cell death. Moreover, the use of the SPr&#8208;G2 dendrimer to conjugate the chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin (CPT), can boost the therapeutic potency of CPT. Excellent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo are obtained from the combinational treatment of the SPr&#8208;G2 dendrimer and CPT. This combinational effect also enhances anti&#8208;tumor immunity through promoting activation of cytotoxic T cells in tumor tissues and maturation of dendritic cells. This study could shed new light on the development of peptide dendritic agents for cancer therapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low generation lysine dendrimer, SPr-G2, responds to intracellular glutathione to initiate bioorthogonal in situ polymerization, resulting in the formation of large assemblies in mouse breast cancer cells. The intracellular large assemblies of SPr-G2 can interact with lysosomes to induce lysosome expansion and enhance lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), leading to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) upregulation on tumor cell surfaces and ultimately tumor cell death. Moreover, the use of the SPr-G2 dendrimer to conjugate the chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin (CPT), can boost the therapeutic potency of CPT. Excellent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo are obtained from the combinational treatment of the SPr-G2 dendrimer and CPT. This combinational effect also enhances anti-tumor immunity through promoting activation of cytotoxic T cells in tumor tissues and maturation of dendritic cells. This study could shed new light on the development of peptide dendritic agents for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids Combined with Three&#8208;Dimensional Hybridization Chain Reaction Amplifiers for Monitoring Multiple Human Tear Cytokines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Existing tear sensors are difficult to perform multiplexed assays due to the minute amounts of biomolecules in tearsand the tiny volume of tears. Herein, we leverage DNA tetrahedral frameworks (DTFs) modified on the wireless portable electrodes to effectively capture three dimensional (3D)&#8208;hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplifiers for automatic and sensitive monitoring of multiple cytokines in human tears. The developed sensors allow the sensitive determination of various dry eye syndrome (DES)&#8208;associated cytokines in human tears with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg/mL, consuming as little as 3 microliters of tear fluid. Double&#8208;blind testing of clinical DES samples using the developed sensor and commercial ELISA showed no significant difference between them. Compared with single&#8208;biomarker diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of this sensor based on multiple biomarkers has improved by approximately 16%. The developed system offers the potential for tear sensors to enable personalized and accurate diagnosis of various ocular diseases.

         <title>Manipulating Stacking Fault Energy to Achieve Crack Inhibition and Superior Strength&#8208;Ductility Synergy in an Additively Manufactured High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>

Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is a revolutionary technology that heralds a new era in metal processing, yet the quality of AM&#8208;produced parts is inevitably compromised by cracking induced by severe residual stress. In this study, we present a novel approach to inhibit cracks and enhance the mechanical performances of AM&#8208;produced alloys by manipulating stacking fault energy (SFE). A high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) based on an equimolar FeCoCrNi composition was selected as the prototype material due to the presence of micro&#8208;cracks during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM process. Introducing a small amount (&#8764;2.4 at. %) of Al doping could effectively lower SFE and yield the formation of multi&#8208;scale microstructures that efficiently dissipate thermal stress during LPBF processing. Distinct from the Al&#8208;free HEA containing visible micro&#8208;cracks, the Al&#8208;doped HEA (Al0.1CoCrFeNi) was crack&#8208;free and demonstrated approximately 55% improvement in elongation without compromising tensile strength. Additionally, the lowered SFE enhanced the resistance to crack propagation, thereby improving the durability of AM&#8208;printed products. By manipulating SFE, the thermal cycle&#8208;induced stress during the printing process can be effectively consumed via stacking faults formation, and the proposed strategy offers novel insights into the development of crack&#8208;free alloys with superior strength&#8208;ductility synergy for intricate structural applications.

         <title>Atomic Scale Structure of Self&#8208;assembled Lipidated Peptide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Peptides have great potential as novel biomaterials and therapeutic agents, due to their unique&#160;ability to self&#8208;assemble into low dimensional nanostructures,&#160;and their resistance to enzymatic degradation&#160;in vivo. However, the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of &#946;&#8208;peptides, which possess increased flexibility due to the extra backbone methylene groups present within the constituent &#946;&#8208;amino acids, are not well understood due to inherent difficulties of observing their bottom&#8208;up growth pathway experimentally. We present a computational approach for the bottom&#8208;up modelling of the self&#8208;assembled&#160;lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptides, from monomers, to oligomers, to supramolecular low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures, in all&#8208;atom detail. The approach was applied to elucidate the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of recently discovered, distinct structural morphologies of low dimensional nanomaterials, assembled from lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide monomers. The resultant structures of the nanobelts and the twisted fibrils were stable throughout subsequent unrestrained all&#8208;atom MD simulations, and these assemblies displayed good agreement with the structural features obtained from X&#8208;ray fiber diffraction and atomic force microscopy data.&#160;This is the first reported, fully&#8208;atomistic model of a lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide&#8208;based nanomaterial, and the computational approach developed here, in combination with experimental fiber diffraction analysis and atomic force microscopy, will be useful in elucidating the atomic scale structure of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based and other supramolecular nanomaterials.

Abstract
The unsatisfactory properties of ceramic aerogels when subjected to thermal shock, such as strength degradation and structural collapse, render them unsuitable for use at large thermal gradients or prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures. Here we present a building&#8208;envelope&#8208;inspired design for fabricating a thermomechanically robust all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel with interlocked fibrous interfaces and an interwoven cellular structure in the orthogonal directions, which is achieved through a two&#8208;stage physical and chemical process. Inspired by the reinforced&#8208;concrete building envelope, we construct a solid foundation composed of fibrous frames and enhance it through supramolecular in situ self&#8208;assembly to achieve high compressibility, retaining over 90% of maximum stress under a considerable compressive strain of 50% for 10000 cycles, and showing temperature&#8208;invariance when compressed at 60% strain within the range of &#8211;100 to 500 &#176;C. As a result of its distinct response to oscillation tolerance coupled with elastic recovery, the all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits exceptional suitability for thermal shock resistance and infrared camouflage performance in cold (&#8211;196 &#176;C) and hot (1300 &#176;C) fields. This study provides an opportunity for developing ceramic aerogels for effective thermal management under extreme conditions.

         <title>Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles with Differential Organ Selectivity for Drug Delivery and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organ&#8208;selective drug delivery is expected to maximize the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities while minimizing their systemic toxicity. Lipid nanoparticles and polymersomes can direct the organ&#8208;selective delivery of mRNAs or gene editing machineries, but their delivery has been limited to mostly liver, spleen, and lung. We urgently need a platform that enables delivery to these and other target organs. Here, we generate a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) comprising five randomly combined sugar moieties and use direct in vivo library screening to identify GlyNPs with preferential biodistribution in liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. Each organ&#8208;targeting GlyNP hit show cellular tropism within the organ. Liver, kidney, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits equipped with therapeutics effectively can alleviate the symptoms of acetaminophen&#8208;induced liver injury, cisplatin&#8208;induced kidney injury, and immune thrombocytopenia in mice, respectively. Furthermore, the differential organ targeting of GlyNP hits is influenced not by the protein corona but by the sugar moieties displayed on their surface. We envision that our GlyNP&#8208;based platform may enable the organ&#8208; and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of therapeutic cargoes.

         <title>Enhanced Plastic Stability: Achieving High Performance in a Al6xxx Alloy Fabricated by Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) facilitates the creation of materials with unique microstructural features and distinctive phenomena as compared to conventional manufacturing methods. Among the various well&#8208;fabricated AM alloys, aluminum alloys garner substantial attention due to their extensive applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. In this work, an Al6xxx alloy is successfully fabricated with the outstanding performance. A nucleation agent is introduced to diminish the susceptibility to cracking during the AM process, thereby inducing a heterogeneous microstructure in this alloy. However, the introduction of ultrafine grains induces plastic instability, evidenced by the presence of L&#252;ders band. This work investigates the evolution of the L&#252;ders band and the strategy to reduce their undesirable effect. The heterogeneity destabilizes the band propagation and thus deteriorates the ductility. Through a T6 heat treatment, the local L&#252;ders strain decreases from 10.0% to 6.2%, leading to a substantial enhancement in plastic stability. With the increase in grain growth and the enlargement of coarse grain regions, the mismatch between the local and macroscopic L&#252;ders strain disappears. Importantly, the strength and the thermal conductivity are concurrently increased. The findings demonstrate the significance of ensuring plastic stability to achieve improved strength&#8208;ductility trade&#8208;off in AM alloys with heterogeneous microstructures.

         <title>Freestanding Serpentine Silicon Strips with Ultrahigh Stretchability over 300% for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Well&#8208;functionalized electronic materials, such as silicon, in a stretchable format are desirable for high&#8208;performance wearable electronics. However, obtaining Si materials that meet the required stretchability of over 100% for wearable applications remains a significant challenge. Herein, a rational design strategy is proposed to achieve freestanding serpentine Si strips (FS&#8208;Si strips) with ultrahigh stretchability, fulfilling wearable requirements. The self&#8208;supporting feature makes the strips get rid of excessive constraints from substrates and enables them to deform with the minimum strain energy. Micrometer&#8208;scale thicknesses enhance robustness, and large diameter&#8208;to&#8208;width ratios effectively reduce strain concentration. Consequently, the FS&#8208;Si strips with the optimum design could withstand 300% stretch, bending, and torsion without fracturing, even under rough manual operation. They also exhibit excellent stability and durability over 50,000 cycles of 100% stretching cycles. For wearable applications, the FS&#8208;Si strips can maintain conformal contact with the skin and have a maximum stretchability of 120%. Moreover, they are electrically insensitive to large deformations, which ensures signal stability during their daily use. Combined with mature processing techniques and the excellent semiconductor properties of Si, FS&#8208;Si strips are promising core stretchable electronic materials for wearable electronics.

         <title>Nanoscale Methods for Longitudinal Extraction of Intracellular Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Longitudinal analysis of cell dynamics is key to advancing biological and medical research, yet traditional methods disrupt cells, limiting sampling to single timepoints and overlooking cellular heterogeneity. Reversibly accessing the cellular membrane for non&#8208;destructive extraction of intracellular contents is a novel concept achieved by recent nanoscale technologies. This perspective explores these nanoscale innovations and addresses challenges in attaining rigorous sampling.








Abstract
Longitudinal analysis of intracellular contents including gene and protein expression is crucial for deciphering the fundamentally dynamic nature of cells. This offers invaluable insights into complex tissue composition and behavior, and drives progress in disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and drug development. Traditional longitudinal analysis workflows, involving the destruction of cells at various timepoints, limit insights to singular moments and fail to account for cellular heterogeneity. Current non&#8208;destructive approaches, like temporal modeling with single&#8208;cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) and live&#8208;cell fluorescence imaging, either rely on biological assumptions or possess the risk of cellular perturbation. Recent advances in nanoscale technologies for non&#8208;destructive intracellular content extraction offer a promising solution to these challenges. These novel methods work at the nanoscale to non&#8208;destructively access cellular membranes and can be broadly classified into three mechanisms: tip&#8208;facilitated aspiration, membrane&#8208;based, and probe&#8208;based methods. This perspective focuses on these emerging nanotechnologies for repeated intracellular content extraction. Their potential in longitudinal analysis is discussed, the critical requirements for effective repeated sampling are addressed, and the suitability of each technique for various applications is explored. Furthermore, unresolved challenges in repeated sampling are highlighted to encourage further research in this growing field.

         <title>Strategies for Improving Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have both excellent stability and continuously broken&#8208;through efficiencies. Herein, the characteristics of inverted PSCs including each functional layers, interfacial regulation strategies, and device stability are summarized. Meanwhile, the applications of inverted structure in tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules are introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and several proposals of PSCs are put forward.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transport layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal, and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>Antigen Presenting Cell Mimetic Lipid Nanoparticles for Rapid mRNA CAR T Cell Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) combine the antigen presenting cell&#8208;mimetic character of commonly used T cell activating beads with the mRNA transfecting capabilities of LNPs. aLNPs facilitate rapid, one&#8208;step activation and transfection of primary human T cells with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) mRNA without requiring activating beads, potentially reducing the complexity, cost, and time of mRNA CAR T cell production.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, producing these bespoke cancer&#8208;killing cells is a complicated ex vivo process involving leukapheresis, artificial T cell activation, and CAR construct introduction. The activation step requires the engagement of CD3/TCR and CD28 and is vital for T cell transfection and differentiation. Though antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) facilitate activation in vivo, ex vivo activation relies on antibodies against CD3 and CD28 conjugated to magnetic beads. While effective, this artificial activation adds to the complexity of CAR T cell production as the beads must be removed prior to clinical implementation. To overcome this challenge, this work develops activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) that mimic APCs to combine the activation of magnetic beads and the transfection capabilities of LNPs. It is shown that aLNPs enable one&#8208;step activation and transfection of primary human T cells with the resulting mRNA CAR T cells reducing tumor burden in a murine xenograft model, validating aLNPs as a promising platform for the rapid production of mRNA CAR T cells.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Stable Multiplexed Biosensors Array in Fully Printed and Integrated Platforms for Reliable Perspiration Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully inkjet&#8208;printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch that exhibits ultra&#8208;high stability and sensitivity. These desirable properties are enabled by the precise control over the active materials mass loading and the unique interpenetrating interfaces, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as one of the promising tools for tracking human body physiological dynamics via non&#8208;invasive perspiration analysis. However, it remains a key challenge to integrate multiplexed sensors in a highly controllable and reproducible manner to achieve long&#8208;term reliable biosensing, especially on flexible platforms. Herein, a fully inkjet printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch with remarkably high stability and sensitivity is reported for the first time. These desirable characteristics are enabled by the unique interpenetrating interface design and precise control over active materials mass loading, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes. The sensors deliver sensitivities of 313.28&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for glucose and 0.87&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for alcohol sensing with minimal drift over 30 h, which are among the best in the literature. The integrated patch can be used for reliable and wireless diet monitoring or medical intervention via epidermal analysis and would inspire the advances of wearable devices for intelligent healthcare applications.

These desirable characteristics are enabled by the unique interpenetrating interface design and precise control over active materials mass loading, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet-assisted printing processes. The sensors deliver sensitivities of 313.28&#160;&#181;A m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for glucose and 0.87&#160;&#181;A m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for alcohol sensing with minimal drift over 30 h, which are among the best in the literature. The integrated patch can be used for reliable and wireless diet monitoring or medical intervention via epidermal analysis and would inspire the advances of wearable devices for intelligent healthcare applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Truly Tiny Acoustic Biomolecules for Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall &#8220;bicones&#8221; are engineered from gas vesicles (GVs), a type of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructure, and produced in bacterial culture. This work develops foundational techniques for their potential applications in ultrasound imaging and therapy, including methods for detection in vitro and in vivo, cavitation, molecular targeting, immune evasion, and protein conjugation.








Abstract
Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography is challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble&#8208;based agents. Here bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes, are described. It is shown that these sub&#8208;80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound&#8208;induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.

         <title>Dynamic Hyperspectral Holography Enabled by Inverse&#8208;Designed Metasurfaces with Oblique Helicoidal Cholesterics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic hyperspectral holography is experimentally demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal. The inverse design enables high information capacity of the multicolor holography and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal provides precise and tunable spectral modulation. As a proof of concept, the optical secret&#8208;sharing platform is demonstrated.









Abstract
Metasurfaces are flat arrays of nanostructures that allow exquisite control of phase and amplitude of incident light. Although metasurfaces offer new active element for both fundamental science and applications, the challenge still remains to overcome their low information capacity and passive nature. Here, by integrating an inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface with oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH), simultaneous spatial and spectral tunable metasurfaces with a high information capacity for dynamic hyperspectral holography, are demonstrated. The inverse design facilitates a single&#8208;phase map encoding of ten independent holographic images at different wavelengths. ChOH provides precise spectral modulation with narrow bandwidth and wide tunable regime in response to programmed stimuli, thus enabling dynamic switching of the multicolor holography. The results provide simple and generalizable principles for the rational design of interactive metasurfaces that will find numerous applications, including security platform.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Ultrathin Perfect Absorber for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the cornea of the compound crab eye, an ultrathin perfect absorber with strong light&#8208;absorption and mechanical stability is proposed. A strong absorption (87%) is realized at subwavelength cross&#8208;section thickness (1/20 of the wavelength), which enables high&#8208;temperature hot&#8208;electron pumping. The absorber is promising for applications in advanced energy, catalysis, and photodetection.








Abstract
Ultrathin perfect absorber (UPA) enables efficient photothermal conversion (PC) in renewable chemical and energy systems. However, it is challenging so far to obtain efficient absorption with thickness significantly less than the wavelength, especially considering the common view that an ultrathin film can absorb at most 50% of incident light. Here, a highly light&#8208;absorbing and mechanically stable UPA is reported by learning from the honeycomb mirror design of the crab compound eyes. With the hollow apertures enclosed by the self&#8208;supporting ultrathin film of reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles, the absorber achieves spoof&#8208;plasmon enhanced broadband absorption in solar spectrum and low radiative decay in infrared. Specifically, a strong absorption (87%) is realized by the apertures with cross&#8208;section thickness of 1/20 of the wavelength, which is 7.3 times stronger than a planar counterpart with the identical material. Its high PC efficiency up to 64%, with hot&#8208;electron temperature as high as 2344&#8201;K, is also experimentally demonstrated. Utilizing its low thermal mass nature, a high&#8208;speed visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared converter is constructed. The absorber can enable high&#8208;performance PC processes for future interfacial catalysis and photon&#8208;detection.

         <title>Unveiling Confinement Engineering for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the innovative confinement effect in rechargeable batteries, presenting a promising approach to address key challenges. It delves into categorizing confinement across scales and proposing strategic designs for manipulating physicochemical properties, electrode stability, and ion transfer. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for harnessing confinement to develop high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
The confinement effect, restricting materials within nano/sub&#8208;nano spaces, has emerged as an innovative approach for fundamental research in diverse application fields, including chemical engineering, membrane separation, and catalysis. This confinement principle recently presents fresh perspectives on addressing critical challenges in rechargeable batteries. Within spatial confinement, novel microstructures and physiochemical properties have been raised to promote the battery performance. Nevertheless, few clear definitions and specific reviews are available to offer a comprehensive understanding and guide for utilizing the confinement effect in batteries. This review aims to fill this gap by primarily summarizing the categorization of confinement effects across various scales and dimensions within battery systems. Subsequently, the strategic design of confinement environments is proposed to address existing challenges in rechargeable batteries. These solutions involve the manipulation of the physicochemical properties of electrolytes, the regulation of electrochemical activity, and stability of electrodes, and insights into ion transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, specific perspectives are provided to deepen the foundational understanding of the confinement effect for achieving high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Overall, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of confinement effects in tailoring the microstructure and physiochemical properties of electrode materials, highlighting their crucial role in designing novel energy storage devices.

         <title>Electroacoustic responsive cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip</title>

Abstract
Organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips can highly simulate the complex physiological functions of organs, exhibiting broad application prospects in developmental research, disease simulation, as well as new drug research and development. However, there is still less concern about effectively constructing cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;chips. Here, we present a novel cochlear organoids integrated conductive hydrogel biohybrid system with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) for cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip construction and high&#8208;throughput drug screening. Benefiting from the superior biocompatibility and electrical property of conductive hydrogel, together with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation, the inner ear progenitor cells can proliferate and spontaneously shape into spheres, finally forming cochlear organoids with good cell viability and structurally mature hair cells. By incorporating these progenitor cells encapsulated hydrogels into a microfluidic&#8208;based cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with culture chambers and a concentration gradient generator, we have demonstrated a dynamic and high&#8208;throughput evaluation of inner ear disease&#8208;related drugs. These results indicated that the proposed cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform has great application potential in organoid cultivation and deafness drug evaluation.

Abstract
In this study, the fundamental but previously overlooked factors of charge generation efficiency and light extraction efficiency (LEE) were explored and collaboratively optimized in tandem quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). By spontaneously forming a microstructured interface, a bulk heterojunction&#8208;like charge&#8208;generation layer composed of a poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)/ZnO bilayer was fabricated and an ideal charge&#8208;generation efficiency surpassing 115% was obtained. The coupling strength of the waveguide mode for the top unit and the plasmon polariton loss for the bottom unit were highly suppressed using precise thickness control, which increased the LEE of the tandem devices. The red tandem QLED achieved an exceptionally low turn&#8208;on voltage for electroluminescence at 4.0&#160;V and an outstanding peak external quantum efficiency of 42.9%. The ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage originated from the sequential electroluminescence turn&#8208;on of the two emissive units of the tandem QLED. Benefiting from its unique electroluminescent features, an easily fabricated optical&#8208;electrical dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting display was built by combining a dichromatic tandem QLED with masking technology.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Mediated Strong Plasticization for High Performance Alginate Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasingly severe plastic pollution has urged an inevitable trend to develop biodegradable plastic products that can take over synthetic plastics. As one of the most abundant natural polymers, polysaccharides is an ideal candidate to substitute synthetic plastics. The rigidity of polysacchride chains principally allows high strength and stiffness of their materials, however, challenges the facile orientation in material processing. Here, a general hydrogen bond mediated plasticization strategy to regulate isotropic sodium alginate (SA) chains to highly ordered state is developed, and alginate plastics with high performances is fabricated. It is revealed that hydroxyl groups in glycerol modulate the viscoelasticity of SA solids by forming strong hydrogen bonds with SA chains, achieving a large stretchability at high solid content. Highly orientated alginate films exhibit superior tensile strength of 575&#160;MPa and toughness of 60.7&#160;MJ/m3, outperforming most regenerated biomass films. The high solid content and large stretchability mediated by strong hydrogen bonding ensure plastic molding of solid&#8208;like SA with high fidelity. This hydrogen bond mediated plasticity provides a facile but effective method to justify the high performances of polysaccharide&#8208;based plastics.

         <title>Observation of Ultrahigh Photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 Nano&#8208;Biocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A nano&#8208;biocomposite film with ultrahigh photoconductivity remains elusive and critical for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. A uniform, well&#8208;connected, high&#8208;concentration nanomaterial network in the biological matrix remains challenging to achieve high photoconductivity. Wafer&#8208;scale continuous nano&#8208;biocomposite film without surface deformations and cracks play another major obstacle. Here we observed ultrahigh photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite film by incorporating a high&#8208;concentration, well&#8208;percolated, and uniform MoS2 network in the ss&#8208;DNA matrix. This was achieved by utilizing DNA&#8208;MoS2 hydrogel formation, which resulted in crack&#8208;free, wafer&#8208;scale DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite films. Ultra&#8208;high photocurrent (5.5&#160;mA at 1&#160;V) with a record&#8208;high on/off ratio (1.3&#215;106) was observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8764;101) reported so far. The incorporation of the Wely semimetal (Bismuth) as an electrical contact exhibited ultrahigh photoresponsivity (2.6&#215;105 A/W). Such high photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite could bridge the gap between biology, electronics, and optics for innovative biomedicine, bioengineering, and neuroscience applications.

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Robust Gel Electrolytes Built from A Charged Double Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) into a rigid&#8208;rod nanofibrillar polymer matrix forms a gel polymer electrolyte that has superior thermomechanical properties over poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), even when incorporating only 8% rigid&#8208;rod polymer. Lithium metal battery testing shows reversible cycling between discharging at ambient temperature and charging at 80&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C, enabling fast recharging and reduced thermal management for, e.g., electric vehicle batteries.








Abstract
Polymer electrolytes have received tremendous interest in the development of solid&#8208;state batteries, but often fall short in one or more key properties required for practical applications. Herein, a rigid gel polymer electrolyte prepared by immobilizing a liquid mixture of a lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether with only 8 wt% poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) is reported. The high charge density and rigid double helical structure of PBDT lead to formation of a nanofibrillar structure that endows this electrolyte with stronger mechanical properties, wider temperature window, and higher battery rate capability compared to all other poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. The ion transport mechanism in this rigid polymer electrolyte is systematically studied using multiple complementary techniques. Li/LiFePO4 cells show excellent capacity retention over long&#8208;term cycling, with thermal cycling reversibility between ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, demonstrating compelling potential for solid&#8208;state batteries targeting fast charging at high temperatures and slower discharging at ambient temperature.

         <title>An Integrated Deposition and Passivation Strategy for Controlled Crystallization of 2D/3D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for depositing multidimensional perovskite thin films is presented, incorporating phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) treatment into the antisolvent step for 3D perovskite formation. Using multimodal in situ characterization, it is shown that PEACl slows crystal growth, resulting in reduced grain boundary recombination and improved device efficiency. PEACl also forms hydrophobic 2D structures, protecting the film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.








Abstract
This work introduces a simplified deposition procedure for multidimensional (2D/3D) perovskite thin films, integrating a phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl)&#8208;treatment into the antisolvent step when forming the 3D perovskite. This simultaneous deposition and passivation strategy reduces the number of synthesis steps while simultaneously stabilizing the halide perovskite film and improving the photovoltaic performance of resulting solar cell devices to 20.8%. Using a combination of multimodal in situ and additional ex situ characterizations, it is demonstrated that the introduction of PEACl during the perovskite film formation slows down the crystal growth process, which leads to a larger average grain size and narrower grain size distribution, thus reducing carrier recombination at grain boundaries and improving the device's performance and stability. The data suggests that during annealing of the wet film, the PEACl diffuses to the surface of the film, forming hydrophobic (quasi&#8208;)2D structures that protect the bulk of the perovskite film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.

         <title>Engineered Microorganisms for Advancing Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineered microorganisms have attracted significant interest as a unique therapeutic platform in tumor treatment. Compared with conventional cancer treatment strategies, engineering microorganism&#8208;based systems provide various distinct advantages, such as the intrinsic capability in targeting tumors, their inherent immunogenicity, in situ production of antitumor agents, and multiple synergistic functions to fight against tumors. Herein, we thoroughly review the design, preparation, and application of the engineered microorganisms for advanced tumor therapy. This review presents a comprehensive survey of innovative tumor therapeutic strategies based on a series of representative engineered microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, microalgae, and fungi. Specifically, it offers extensive analyses of the design principles, engineering strategies, and tumor therapeutic mechanisms, as well as the advantages and limitations of different engineered microorganism&#8208;based systems. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future research prospects in this field, which can inspire new ideas for the design of creative tumor therapy paradigms utilizing engineered microorganisms and facilitate their clinical applications.

         <title>Space&#8208;Efficient 3D Microalgae Farming with Optimized Resource Utilization for Regenerative Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photosynthetic microalgae produce valuable metabolites and are a source of sustainable food that supports life without compromising arable land. However, the light self&#8208;shading, excessive water supply, and insufficient space utilization in microalgae farming have limited its potential in the inland areas most in need of regenerative food solutions. Herein, we develop a 3D polysaccharide&#8208;based hydrogel scaffold for vertically farming microalgae without needing liquid media. This liquid&#8208;free strategy is compatible with diverse microalgal species and enables the design of living microalgal frameworks with customizable architectures that enhance light and water utilization. This approach significantly increases microalgae yield per unit water consumption, with an 8.8&#8208;fold increase compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the dehydrated hydrogels demonstrate a reduced size and weight (&#8764;70% reduction), but readily recover their vitality upon rehydration. Importantly, valuable natural products can be produced in our system including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and carotenoids. This study streamlines microalgae regenerative farming for low&#8208;carbon biomanufacturing by minimizing light self&#8208;shading, relieving water supply, and reducing physical footprints, and democratizing access to efficient aquatic food production.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Bioactivation of Inert Materials with Plasma&#8208;Polymerized Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional gas plasma treatments are crucial for functionalizing materials in biomedical applications, but have limitations that hinder their broader use. These methods require exposure to reactive media under vacuum conditions, rendering them unsuitable for substrates that demand aqueous environments, such as proteins and hydrogels. Additionally, complex geometries are difficult to treat, necessitating extensive customization for each material and shape. To address these constraints, we propose an innovative approach employing plasma polymer nanoparticles (PPN) as a versatile functionalisation tool. PPN share similarities with traditional plasma polymer coatings (PPC) but offer unique advantages: compatibility with aqueous systems, the ability to modify complex geometries, and availability as off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf products. In our study, we demonstrate robust immobilization of PPN on various substrates, including synthetic polymers, proteins, and complex hydrogel structures. This results in substantial improvements in surface hydrophilicity. Materials functionalisation with arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD)&#8208;loaded PPN, significantly enhances cell attachment, spreading, and substrate coverage on inert scaffolds compared to passive RGD coatings. We also demonstrate improved adhesion to complex geometries and subsequent differentiation following growth factor exposure.&#160;Our research introduces a novel substrate functionalisation approach that mimics the outcomes of plasma coating technology but vastly expands its applicability, promising advancements in biomedical materials and devices.

         <title>Construction of Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 Tandem Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst Induced Aldehyde Oxidation and the Co&#8208;Activation of Reactants for Biomass Effective and Multi&#8208;Selective Upgrading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 tandem heterogeneous electrocatalyst, which exhibits excellent 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation activity is constructed. The analytical results indicate that the tandem material can promote aldehyde oxidation in the low potential region, enhance the enrichment and transformation of reactants in the high potential region, and then efficiently obtain 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furanoic acid and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid in the tunable potential ranges.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a feasible way for utilization of biomass resources. However, how to regulate the selective synthesis of multiple value&#8208;added products is still a great challenge. The cobalt&#8208;based compound is a promising catalyst due to its direct and indirect oxidation properties, but its weak adsorption capacity restricts its further development. Herein, by constructing Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 heterogeneous catalyst, the efficient and selective synthesis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furanoic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at different potential ranges are realized. Based on various physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is proved that the addition of Ag can effectively promote the oxidation of aldehyde group to a carboxyl group, and then generate HMFCA at low potential. Moreover, the introduction of Ag can activate cobalt&#8208;based compounds, thus strengthening the adsorption of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promoting the formation of FDCA. This work achieves the selective synthesis of two value&#8208;added chemicals by one tandem catalyst and deeply analyzes the adsorption enhancement mechanism of the catalyst, which provides a powerful guidance for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Top&#8208;Down Induced Crystallization Orientation toward Highly Efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down engineering strategy of perovskite crystallization is introduced via propylamine chloride (PACl) post treatment of perovskite wet film, inducing downward preferred crystallization orientation and realizing excellent homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 25.07% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PVSCs, as well as the enhanced thermal and operational stability.









Abstract
Crystallization orientation plays a crucial role in determining the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whereas effective strategies for realizing oriented perovskite crystallization is still lacking. Herein, a facile and efficient top&#8208;down strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization orientation via treating perovskite wet film with propylamine chloride (PACl) before annealing. The PA+ ions tend to be adsorbed on the (001) facet of the perovskite surface, resulting in the reduced cleavage energy to induce (001) orientation&#8208;dominated growth of perovskite film and then reduce the temperature of phase transition, meanwhile, the penetrating Cl ions further regulate the crystallization process. As&#8208;prepared (001)&#8208;dominant perovskite films exhibit the ameliorative film homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale, leading to alleviated lattice mismatch and lowered defect density. The resultant PVSC devices deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.07% with enhanced stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of operation at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Programmed Targeting Pyruvate Metabolism Therapy Amplified Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme&#8208;Activated Pyroptosis for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric N, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx) is developed to enhance cellular immunogenicity and reshape the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) for effective antitumor immunotherapy. Not only does it trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells but also remodels the immunosuppressive TME by a programmed targeting of pyruvate metabolism.








Abstract
Increasing cellular immunogenicity and reshaping the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial for antitumor immunotherapy. Herein, this work develops a novel single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator: UK5099 and pyruvate oxidase (POx)&#8208;co&#8208;loaded Cu&#8208;NS single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx), that not only trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells, but also remodel the immunosuppressive TME by targeting pyruvate metabolism. By replacing N with weakly electronegative S, the original spatial symmetry of the Cu&#8208;N4 electron distribution is changed and the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process is effectively regulated. Compared to spatially symmetric Cu&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;N4 SA), the S&#8208;doped spatially asymmetric single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;NS SA) exhibit stronger oxidase activities, including peroxidase (POD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOx), L&#8208;cysteine oxidase (LCO), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), which can cause enough reactive oxygen species (ROS) storms to trigger pyroptosis. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;NS SA, UK5099, and POx can target pyruvate metabolism, which not only improves the immune TME but also increases the degree of pyroptosis. This study provides a two&#8208;pronged treatment strategy that can significantly activate antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, NADH/glutathione/L&#8208;cysteine consumption, pyruvate oxidation, and lactic acid (LA)/ATP depletion, triggering pyroptosis and regulating metabolism. This work provides a broad vision for expanding antitumor immunotherapy.

This study provides a two-pronged treatment strategy that can significantly activate antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, NADH/glutathione/&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-cysteine consumption, pyruvate oxidation, and lactic acid (LA)/ATP depletion, triggering pyroptosis and regulating metabolism. This work provides a broad vision for expanding antitumor immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Electron Redistribution in Niobic&#8208;Oxygen Vacancy Associates to Tune Noncovalent Interaction in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates are engineered into niobic acid atomic layers via Ar plasma etching. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The role of vacancy associates in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an open question. Herein, the Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates (VNb&#9472;O) are engineered into niobic acid (NA) atomic layers to tailor the CO2 photoreduction performance. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates. This unique configuration contributes to the 9.3 times increased activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Meantime, this VNb&#9472;O NA also shows excellent photocatalytic activity for NO3&#8722;&#8211;NH4+ synthesis, with NH4+ formation rate up to 3442&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work supplies fresh insights into the vacancy associate design for electron redistribution and noncovalent interaction tuning in photocatalysis.

         <title>Stretch&#8208;Induced Conductivity Enhancement in Highly Conductive and Tough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive and tough hydrogels composed of liquid metal (LM), silver nanowires (AgNWs), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are constructed. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline form conductive pathways and enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels, including ultimate fracture stress, strain, toughness, and dramatically enhance the electrical conductivity (from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 at 4200% strain).








Abstract
The resistance of gels and elastomers increases significantly with tensile strain, which reduces conductive stability and restricts their use in stable and reliable electronics. Here, highly conductive tough hydrogels composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs), liquid metal (LM), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are fabricated. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline create conductive pathways, enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, including increased ultimate fracture stress (13&#8208;33&#160;MPa), strain (3000&#8211;5300%), and toughness (390.9&#8211;765.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Notably, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogels is significantly improved from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 when stretched to 4200% strain, representing a 6000&#8208;fold enhancement. The incorporation of PVA nanocrystalline, deformable LM, and AgNWs effectively mitigates stress concentration at the crack tip, thereby conferring crack propagation insensitivity and fatigue resistance to the hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels are designed with a reversible crosslinking network, allowing for water&#8208;induced recycling.

         <title>Ingestible Artificial Urinary Biomarker Probes for Urine Test of Gastrointestinal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingestible artificial urinary biomarker probe can specifically react with cancer biomarkers in colon tumors and subsequently release renal&#8208;clearable small tetrazine fragments, allowing for fluorescence turn&#8208;on urine detection via bioorthogonal reaction with a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged fluorophore.








Abstract
Although colorectal cancer diagnosed at an early stage shows high curability, methods simultaneously possessing point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing ability and high sensitivity are limited. Here, an orally deliverable biomarker&#8208;activatable probe (termed as HATS) for early detection of orthotopic tumors via remote urinalysis is presented. To enable its oral delivery to the colon, HATS is designed to have remarkable resistance to acidity and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine and negligible intestinal absorption. Upon reaction with a cancer biomarker in the colon segment, HATS releases a small fragment of tetrazine that can transverse the intestinal barrier, enter blood circulation, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to urine. Subsequently, the urinary tetrazine fragment is detected by bioorthogonal reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged resorufin (TCO&#8208;Reso) to afford a rapid and specific fluorescence enhancement of TCO&#8208;Reso. Such signal readout is correlated with the urinary tetrazine concentration and thus measures the level of cancer biomarkers in the colon. HATS&#8208;based optical urinalysis detects orthotopic colon tumors two weeks earlier than clinical serological tests and can be developed to a point&#8208;of&#8208;care paper test. Thereby, HATS&#8208;based urinalysis provides a non&#8208;invasive and sensitive approach to cancer screening at low&#8208;resource settings.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale, Vertically Aligned 2D Subnanochannel Arrays by a Smectic Liquid Crystal Network for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays in a smectic liquid crystal network is fabricated by photo&#8208;polymerization. As&#8208;prepared membrane demonstrates a power output of &#8776;22.5 W m&#8722;2 when mixing artificial river water and seawater based on its 2D directional nanochannels and high charge density. This work first presents the great potential of liquid crystal materials in osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
The osmotic energy, an abundant renewable energy source, can be directly converted to electricity by nanofluidic devices with ion&#8208;selective membranes. 2D nanochannels constructed by nanosheets possess abundant lateral interfacial ion&#8208;exchange sites and exhibit great superiority in nanofluidic devices. However, the most accessible orientation of the 2D nanochannels is parallel to the membrane surface, undoubtedly resulting in the conductivity loss. Herein, first vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays self&#8208;assembled by a smectic liquid crystal (LC) network that exhibit high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion are demonstrated. The 2D subnanochannel arrays are fabricated by in situ photopolymerization of monomers in the LC phase. The as&#8208;prepared membrane exhibits excellent water&#8208;resistance and mechanical strength. The 2D subnanochannels with excellent cation selectivity and conductivity show high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. The power density reaches up to about 22.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 with NaCl solution under a 50&#8208;fold concentration gradient, which is among with ultrahigh power density. This membrane design concept provides promising applications in osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure Monitoring with Mechanically&#8208;Compliant Hydrogel Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure with Hydrogel Interfaces: Wireless pressure sensors are anchored onto the biological tissues/organs with a mechanically&#8208;compliant and robust hydrogel interface, which could effectively alleviate foreign body responses and mitigate the interfacial mechanical mismatch, and enhance the efficacy of the wireless pressure sensing.








Abstract
Recent electronics&#8208;tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long&#8208;term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically&#8208;varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, a general yet reliable approach is reported to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability, and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period.

&lt;p&gt;Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure with Hydrogel Interfaces: Wireless pressure sensors are anchored onto the biological tissues/organs with a mechanically-compliant and robust hydrogel interface, which could effectively alleviate foreign body responses and mitigate the interfacial mechanical mismatch, and enhance the efficacy of the wireless pressure sensing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent electronics-tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long-term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically-varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, a general yet reliable approach is reported to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability, and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period. The operation of the wireless sensor has been demonstrated with a custom-made pressure sensing model and in vivo intracranial pressure monitoring in rats. This technology may be advantageous in real-time post-operative monitoring of various biological inner pressures after the reconstructive surgery, thus guaranteeing the timely treatment of lethal&#160;diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Mode Random Lasing of Tin Halide Perovskites Integrated in a Vertical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the tuning of the Random Lasing (RL) characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed, while single&#8208;mode RL is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy.








Abstract
The development of random lasing (RL) with predictable and controlled properties is an important step to make these cheap optical sources stable and reliable. However, the design of tailored RL characteristics (emission energy, threshold, number of modes) is only obtained with complex photonic structures, while the simplest optical configurations able to tune the RL are still a challenge. This work demonstrates the tuning of the RL characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity with low quality factor. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed. More importantly, single mode RL operation with the lowest threshold and a quality factor as high as 1&#160;000 (twenty times the quality factor of the resonator) is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy due to higher gain. These results can have important technological implications toward the development of low&#8208;cost RL sources without chaotic behavior.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low Modulus of Ductile TiZrHfTa Biomedical High&#8208;Entropy Alloys through Deformation Induced Martensitic Transformation/Twinning/Amorphization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, an excellent biocompatibility, and an acceptable ductility possess significant challenges in traditional biomedical alloys. This work presents a generic solution to an ever&#8208;lasting challenge in metal materials design: i.e., achieving low Young's modulus analogous to the human bone while maintaining commendable tensile ductility as well as excellent biocompatibility in a biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA).








Abstract
Biomedical alloys are paramount materials in biomedical applications, particularly in crafting biological artificial replacements. In traditional biomedical alloys, a significant challenge is simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and acceptable ductility. A multi&#8208;component body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA), which is composed of non&#8208;toxic elements, is noteworthy for its outstanding biocompatibility and compositional tuning capabilities. Nevertheless, the aforementioned challenges still remain. Here, a method to achieve a single phase with the lowest Young's modulus among the constituent phases by precisely tuning the stability of the BCC phase in the Bio&#8208;HEA, is proposed. The subtle tuning of the BCC phase stability also enables the induction of stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation with extremely low trigger stress. The transformation&#8208;induced plasticity and work hardening capacity are achieved via the stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation. Additionally, the hierarchical stress&#8208;induced martensite twin structure and crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation provide robust toughening mechanisms in the Bio&#8208;HEA. The cytotoxicity test confirms that this Bio&#8208;HEA exhibits excellent biocompatibility without cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the development of biomedical alloys with a combination of ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and decent ductility.

         <title>From Charge to Spin: An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Electron Transfer in Energy Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Catalytic materials play crucial roles in various energy&#8208;related processes, ranging from large&#8208;scale chemical production to advancements in renewable energy technologies. Despite a century of dedicated research, major enduring challenges associated with enhancing catalyst efficiency and durability, particularly in green energy&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, remain. Focusing only on either the crystal structure or electronic structure of a catalyst is deemed insufficient to break the linear scaling relationship (LSR), which is the golden rule for the design of advanced catalysts. The discourse in this review intricately outlines the essence of heterogenous catalysis reactions by highlighting the vital roles played by electron properties. The physical and electrochemical properties of electron charge and spin that govern catalysis efficiencies are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the pronounced influence of external fields in perturbing the LSR, underscoring the vital role that electron spin plays in advancing high&#8208;performance catalyst design. The review culminates by proffering insights into the potential applications of spin catalysis, concluding with a discussion of extant challenges and inherent limitations.

         <title>Multiphase Under&#8208;Liquid Biofabrication with Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures with Microbial Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8208;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, we introduce a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8208;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis. The process uses under&#8208;liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. We first evaluate cellulose productivity in static conditions using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8208;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under&#8208;liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC&#8208;based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under&#8208;liquid networking (multi&#8208;layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes). Overall, the proposed platform combines living matter and multi&#8208;phase systems as a robust option for material development with relevance in biomedicine, soft robotics and bioremediation, among others.

         <title>Topological complex charge conservation in nontrivial Z2xZ2 domain walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Localized topological modes such as solitons, Majorana Fermions, and skyrmions are attracting great interest as robust information carriers for future devices. Here we discover a novel conserved quantity for topological domain wall networks of an Z2&#215;Z2&#160;order generated with spin&#8208;polarized current in Sr2VO3FeAs. Domain walls are mobilized by the scanning tunneling current, which also observes in atomic scale active dynamics of domain wall vertices including merge, bifurcation, pair creation and annihilation. Within this dynamics, the product of the topological complex charges defined for domain wall vertices is conserved with a novel boundary&#8208;charge correspondence rule. These results may open an avenue toward topological electronics based on domain wall vertices in generic Z2&#215;Z2&#160;systems.

         <title>Photothermal Actuation of Thick 3D&#8208;Printed Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that transduce an input energy into a mechanical response. LCE composites prepared with photothermal agents, such as nanoinclusions, are a means to realize wireless, remote, and local control of deformation with light. Amongst photothermal agents, gold nanorods (AuNRs) are highly efficient converters when the irradiation wavelength matches the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the AuNRs. However, AuNR aggregation broadens the LSPR which also reduces photothermal efficiency. Here, we engineer the surface chemistry of AuNRs via a well&#8208;controlled two&#8208;step ligand exchange with a monofunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) thiol that greatly improves dispersion of AuNRs in LCEs. Accordingly, LCE&#8208;AuNR nanocomposites with very low PEG&#8208;AuNR content (0.01 wt%) prepared by 3D printing are shown to be highly efficient photothermal actuators with rapid response (&gt;60% strain s&#8722;1) upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 808&#160;nm) light. Because of the excellent dispersion of PEG&#8208;AuNR within the LCE, unabsorbed NIR light transmits through the nanocomposites and can actuate a series of samples. Further, the dispersion also allows for optical deformation of millimeter&#8208;thick 3D printed structures without sacrificing actuation speed. The realization of well&#8208;dispersed nanoinclusions to maximize stimulus&#8208;response of LCEs could benefit functional implementation in soft robotics or medical devices.

         <title>The Case for a Defect Genome Initiative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects in crystalline solids are likened to new &#8220;elements&#8221; beyond the periodic table. In the spirit of the Material Genome Initiative, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) is proposed to fast&#8208;track defect discoveries for energy, quantum, and other applications. This initiative focuses on open defect platforms, data&#8208;driven defect design, and experimental methods, hoping to spur a new community&#8208;wide interest.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has streamlined the materials discovery effort by leveraging generic traits of materials, with focus largely on perfect solids. Defects such as impurities and perturbations, however, drive many attractive functional properties of materials. The rich tapestry of charge, spin, and bonding states hosted by defects are not accessible to elements and perfect crystals, and defects can thus be viewed as another class of &#8220;elements&#8221; that lie beyond the periodic table. Accordingly, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) to accelerate functional defect discovery for energy, quantum information, and other applications is proposed. First, major advances made under the MGI are highlighted, followed by a delineation of pathways for accelerating the discovery and design of functional defects under the DGI. Near&#8208;term goals for the DGI are suggested. The construction of open defect platforms and design of data&#8208;driven functional defects, along with approaches for fabrication and characterization of defects, are discussed. The associated challenges and opportunities are considered and recent advances towards controlled introduction of functional defects at the atomic scale are reviewed. It is hoped this perspective will spur a community&#8208;wide interest in undertaking a DGI effort in recognition of the importance of defects in enabling unique functionalities in materials.

         <title>Emerging Amorphous to Crystalline Conversion Chemistry in Ca&#8208;Doped VO2 Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Term Wearable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding amorphous Ca&#8208;doped V2O5 (a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5) is successfully fabricated via an in situ electrochemical oxidation strategy as a novel cathode material for flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). Benefiting from the unique amorphous structure and high conductivity, the as&#8208;assembled FAZIBs exhibit superior electrochemical performance accompanied by amorphous&#8211;crystalline reversible conversion chemistry during the charge/discharge process.








Abstract
Amorphous transition metal oxides have attracted significant attention in energy storage devices owing to their potentially desirable electrochemical properties caused by abundant unsaturated dangling bonds. However, the amorphization further amplifies the shortcoming of the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity of the metal oxides, resulting in unsatisfying rate capability and power density. Herein, freestanding amorphous Ca&#8208;doped V2O5 (a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5) cathodes are successfully prepared via in situ electrochemical oxidation of Ca&#8208;doped VO2 nanoarrays for wearable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The doping of Ca and construction of freestanding structure effectively uncover the potential of amorphous V2O5, which can make full use of the abundant active sites for high volumetric capacity and simultaneously achieve fast reaction kinetics for excellent rate performance. More importantly, the introduction of Ca can notably reduce the formation energy of VO2 according to theoretical calculation results and realizes amorphous to crystalline reversible conversion chemistry in the charge/discharge procedure, thereby facilitating the reversible capacity of the newly developed a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5. This work provides an innovative design strategy to construct high&#8208;rate capacity amorphous metal oxides as freestanding electrodes for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safe wearable energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Targeting Mesenchymal Stem Cells Combined with Photothermal Treatment Attenuate Severe Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanostars&#8208;conjugated mesenchymal stem cells, functionalized with triamcinolone, serve as a potent corticosteroids. Their therapeutic effectiveness is enhanced by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, generating localized heat. Thermo&#8208;responsive T lymphocytes exhibit diminished activity, attribute to interleukin 22 receptor inactivation under NIR laser exposure. This multifaceted approach adds therapeutic modulation in the treatment of severe arthritis.








Abstract
Current clinical therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of osteo&#8208; and rheumatoid&#8208;arthritis is obviously limited. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as a source of promising regenerative therapy, un&#8208;modified or genetically engineered MSCs injected in vivo restrict their clinical utility because of the low drug efficacy and unpredicted side effect, respectively. Herein, a strategy to enhance the migration efficacy of MSCs to inflamed joints via an inflammation&#8208;mediated education process is demonstrated. To reinforce the limited anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of MSCs, gold nanostar loaded with triamcinolone is conjugated to MSC. Furthermore, near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) induced by gold nanostar significantly elevates the anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy of the developed drugs, even in advanced stage arthritis model. An immunological regulation mechanism study of PTT is first suggested in this study; the expression of the interleukin 22 receptor, implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis, is downregulated in T lymphocytes by PTT, and Th17 differentiation from na&#239;ve CD4 T cell is inhibited. Collectively, inflammation&#8208;targeting MSCs conjugated with triamcinolone&#8208;loaded gold nanostar (Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA) promote the repolarization of macrophages and decrease neutrophil recruitment in joints. In addition, Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA significantly alleviate arthritis&#8208;associated pain, improve general locomotor activity, and more importantly, induce cartilage regeneration even for severe stages of arthritis model.

         <title>A Sodiophilic Amyloid Fibril Modified Separator for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite separator is fabricated through the vacuum filtration technique, which incorporates a unique amyloid fibril onto a glass&#8208;fiber separator. The composite separator demonstrates remarkable efficacy in suppressing the growth of sodium dendrites due to the formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase film enriched with nitride, which showcases its potential as a promising solution in sodium&#8208;battery technology.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) batteries are being considered as prospective candidates for the next generation of secondary batteries in contrast to lithium&#8208;based batteries, due to their high raw&#8208;material abundance, low cost, and sustainability. However, the unfavorable growth of Na&#8208;metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a vacuum filtration strategy, through amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified glass&#8208;fiber separators, is proposed to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800&#160;h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na&#8208;based electrodes under an ester&#8208;based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both the experimental and the theoretical results show that the sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes the electric field and Na&#8208;ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na3N&#8208; and NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve the dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmentally friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.

     alt="A Sodiophilic Amyloid Fibril Modified Separator for Dendrite-Free Sodium-Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel composite separator is fabricated through the vacuum filtration technique, which incorporates a unique amyloid fibril onto a glass-fiber separator. The composite separator demonstrates remarkable efficacy in suppressing the growth of sodium dendrites due to the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte-interphase film enriched with nitride, which showcases its potential as a promising solution in sodium-battery technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium (Na) batteries are being considered as prospective candidates for the next generation of secondary batteries in contrast to lithium-based batteries, due to their high raw-material abundance, low cost, and sustainability. However, the unfavorable growth of Na-metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large-scale applications. Here, a vacuum filtration strategy, through amyloid-fibril-modified glass-fiber separators, is proposed to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800&#160;h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na-based electrodes under an ester-based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid-fibril-modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both the experimental and the theoretical results show that the sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes the electric field and Na-ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N- and NaN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-rich solid-electrolyte-interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve the dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmentally friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super&#8208;Structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>

Super&#8208;structured wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogel designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange and in situ photocuring procedures integrates ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.








Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel as dissipative layer and in situ photocuring technology for entangling quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;based wet&#8208;adhesive layer (PAAc&#8208;N+) with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, the hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

         <title>Single Atom Iridium Decorated Nickel Alloys Supported on Segregated MoO2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, conductive oxide supported Ir1Ni single atom alloys bifunctional electrocatalysts via surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction strategy, weakening the hydrogen binding energy by Ir&#8208;Ni electronic interaction, and decoration of Ir single atom accelerates surface reconstruction of Ni species to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction is successfully designed.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;interface engineering has been widely employed to develop supported multicomponent catalysts for water electrolysis, but it still remains a substantial challenge for supported single atom alloys. Herein a conductive oxide MoO2 supported Ir1Ni single atom alloys (Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs) bifunctional electrocatalysts through surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction, where the Ir atoms are atomically anchored onto the surface of Ni nanoclusters via the Ir&#8208;Ni coordination accompanied with electron transfer from Ni to Ir is reported. Benefiting from the unique structure, the Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs not only exhibit low overpotential of 48.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 19&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 for hydrogen evolution reaction, but also show highly efficient alkaline water oxidation with overpotential of 280&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Their overall water electrolysis exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.52&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8208;Ni interface effectively weakens hydrogen binding energy, and decoration of the Ir single atoms boost surface reconstruction of Ni species to enhance the coverage of intermediates (OH*) and switch the potential&#8208;determining step. It is suggested that this approach opens up a promising avenue to design efficient and durable precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts.

A miniaturized chip, consisting of a micropatterned and porous polymer film, is presented for light&#8208;induced drug addition in cell&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening. The photoisomerization of atom transfer radical polymerization&#8208;grafted azobenzene enables spatial and temporal control, leveraging digital light processing systems to simultaneously regulate and release integrated cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs in numerous droplets with suspended or adhered cells, undisturbed and programmable.








Abstract
Simultaneously adding multiple drugs and other chemical reagents to individual droplets at specific time points presents a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with tiny droplets in high&#8208;throughput screening applications. In this study, a micropatterned polymer chip is developed as a miniaturized platform for light&#8208;induced programmable drug addition in cell&#8208;based screening. This chip incorporates a porous superhydrophobic polymer film with atom transfer radical polymerization reactivity, facilitating the efficient grafting of azobenzene methacrylate, a photoconformationally changeable group, onto the hydrophilic regions of polymer matrix at targeted locations and with precise densities. By employing light irradiation, the cyclodextrin&#8208;azobenzene host&#8211;guest complexes formed on the polymer chip can switch from an &#8220;associated&#8221; to a &#8220;dissociated&#8221; state, granting precise photochemical control over the supramolecular coding system and its surface patterning ability. Significantly, the exceptional spatial and temporal control offered by these chemical transitions empowers to utilize digital light processing systems for simultaneous regulation and release of cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs across numerous droplets containing suspended or adhered cells. This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high&#8208;throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architected Alkaline&#8208;Earth Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed approach enabling custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for additive manufacturing using two&#8208;photon lithography is introduced. The approach permits the production of 3D alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) microarchitectures with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to understand the defects and determine the photoluminescence lifetimes.








Abstract
3D ceramic architectures are captivating geometrical features with an immense demand in optics. In this work, an additive manufacturing (AM) approach for printing alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite 3D microarchitectures is developed. The approach enables custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for two&#8208;photon lithography, permitting the production of alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) 3D structures shaped in the form of octet&#8208;truss lattices, gyroids, or inspired architectures like sodalite zeolite, and C60 buckyballs with micrometric and nanometric feature sizes. Alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite morphological, structural, and chemical characteristics are studied. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to estimate the lifetime rate and defects in BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3. From a broad perspective, this AM methodology facilitates the production of 3D&#8208;structured mixed oxides. These findings are the first steps toward dimensionally refined high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index ceramics for micro&#8208;optics and other terrains like (photo/electro)catalysis.

The approach enables custom-made photoresists suited for two-photon lithography, permitting the production of alkaline-earth perovskite (BaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SrZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) 3D structures shaped in the form of octet-truss lattices, gyroids, or inspired architectures like sodalite zeolite, and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; buckyballs with micrometric and nanometric feature sizes. Alkaline-earth perovskite morphological, structural, and chemical characteristics are studied. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide-field photoluminescence emission to estimate the lifetime rate and defects in BaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SrZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. From a broad perspective, this AM methodology facilitates the production of 3D-structured mixed oxides. These findings are the first steps toward dimensionally refined high-refractive-index ceramics for micro-optics and other terrains like (photo/electro)catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft, Long&#8208;Lived, Bioresorbable Electronic Surgical Mesh with Wireless Pressure Monitor and On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh is presented that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation, and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.








Abstract
Current research in the area of surgical mesh implants is somewhat limited to traditional designs and synthesis of various mesh materials, whereas meshes with multiple functions may be an effective approach to address long&#8208;standing challenges including postoperative complications. Herein, a bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh is presented that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. The study of materials and mesh layouts provides a wide range of tunability of mechanical and biochemical properties. Dissolvable dielectric composite with porous structure in a pyramidal shape enhances sensitivity of a wireless capacitive pressure sensor, and resistive microheaters integrated with inductive coils provide thermo&#8208;responsive drug delivery system for an antibacterial agent. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation, and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.

         <title>3D Printing of Flow&#8208;Inspired Anisotropic Patterns with Liquid Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling liquid crystal polymers that align during extrusion can bring us closer to the exquisite complexity of microstructures found in natural materials. By modulating nozzle pressure, an order of magnitude stiffness variation is achieved through a change of the molecular orientation at the nozzle tip. This enables the shaping of anisotropic patterns with stiffness and curvature gradients through extrusion 3D printing.








Abstract
Anisotropic materials formed by living organisms possess remarkable mechanical properties due to their intricate microstructure and directional freedom. In contrast, human&#8208;made materials face challenges in achieving similar levels of directionality due to material and manufacturability constraints. To overcome these limitations, an approach using 3D printing of self&#8208;assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) is presented. Their high stiffness and strength is granted by nematic domains aligning during the extrusion process. Here, a remarkably wide range of Young's modulus from 3 to 40 GPa is obtained by utilizing directionality of the nematic flow the printing process. &#160; By determining a relationship between stiffness, nozzle diameter, and line width, a design space where shaping and mechanical performance can be&#160;combined is identified. The ability to print LCPs with on&#8208;the&#8208;fly width changes to accommodate arbitrary spatially varying directions is demonstrated. This unlocks the possibility to manufacture exquisite patterns inspired by fluid dynamics with steep curvature variations. Utilizing the synergy between this path&#8208;planning method and LCPs, functional objects with stiffness and curvature gradients can be 3D&#8208;printed,&#160;offering potential applications in lightweight sustainable structures embedding crack&#8208;mitigation strategies. This method also opens avenues for studying and replicating&#160;intricate patterns observed in nature, such as wood or turbulent flow using 3D printing.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant negative capacitance response is directly observed in the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium. When compared to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics, molecular ferroelectrics, in which order&#8211;disorder transition of the molecular induces the occurrence of polarization, would have a smaller ferroelectric anisotropy parameter &#945; and a larger domain wall formation energy.








Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the NC in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, the focus is centered on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II), and a pioneering investigation on their NC responses is conducted. The findings demonstrate that the NC exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Straightforward Design Strategy toward 3D Near&#8208;Net&#8208;Shape Stoichiometric SiC Parts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward design strategy coupling a granule&#8208;based fused deposition modeling process and preceramic polymer manipulation highlights the production of 3D near&#8208;net&#8208;shape stoichiometric SiC parts with a high potential impact in adverse environments as mirrors for lightweight opto&#8208;mechanical systems, as high&#8208;flux concentrated solar receivers and as heat exchangers for thermal management.








Abstract
Fused deposition modeling (FDM), traditionally reserved for thermoplastics, is modified here with a granule&#8208;based extrusion head to be extended to advanced nonoxide ceramics via a straightforward design strategy that considers the shaping opportunities and the chemical richness offered by preceramic polymers. Specifically, 3D near&#8208;net&#8208;shape stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) objects are designed by manipulating the key features of a commercially available polycarbosilane (fusibility, high carbon content, relatively high SiC yield). In the early stage of the process, the carbon&#8208;rich polycarbosilane is first mixed with Si and SiC fillers and then thermolyzed at 120 &#176;C to increase polymer branching while offering tailored rheological properties during the subsequent extrusion process at 90 &#176;C and adequate shape retention once extruded. This allows for the design of tailored and complex 3D complex polycarbosilane&#8208;based architectures with features down to 400&#160;&#181;m. Polymer&#8208;based parts are further converted into 3D stoichiometric SiC objects with quasi&#8208;near&#8208;net&#8208;shape&#8212;a volume shrinkage reduced to 9.1% is measured&#8212;by heat treatment at a temperature as low as 1400 &#176;C (argon flow). Given the flexibility to tune the preceramic polymer chemical and rheological properties, a new combined design approach is leveraged to generate bespoke advanced ceramics with a high freedom in geometry complexity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Regulation of Pt Strain Derived from Pt3Ga Intermetallic for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by altering the symmetry of the PtGa&#8208;intermetallic structure, the stress environment in the surface Pt layer is precisely modified. By increasing strain, the key intermediate desorption step accelerates, resulting Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{\it 3}$m) with high symmetry exhibiting 10 times higher mass activity than commercial PtC and other samples with stretched surface.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based fuel cell catalysts with excellent activity and stability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been developed through strain regulation in recent years. Herein, this work demonstrates that symmetry&#8208;induced strain regulation of Pt surface of PtGa intermetallic compounds can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With the strain environment varies derived from the lattice mismatch of analogous PtGa core but different symmetry, the Pt surface of the PtGa alloy and the Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) precisely realize 0.58% and 2.7% compressive strain compared to the Pt3Ga (P4/mmm). Experimental and theoretical results reveal that when the compressive stress of the Pt lattice increases, the desorption process of O* intermediates becomes accelerated, which is conducive to oxygen reduction. The Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) with high symmetry and compressive Pt surface exhibit the highest mass and specific activities of 2.18 A mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.36 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, which are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This work demonstrates that material symmetry can be used to precisely modulate Pt surface stress to enhance the ORR, as well as provide a distinct platform to investigate the relationship between Pt compressibility and catalytic activity.

The pH&#8208;switchable GPBO can target the bacteria of the wound site.

Abstract
Treatment of diabetic wounds is a significant clinical challenge due to the massive infections caused by bacteria. In this study, multifunctional glycol chitosan and polydopamine&#8208;coated BiO1&#8208;xI (GPBO) nanoparticles (NPs) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal and photocatalytic abilities are prepared. When infection occurs, the local microenvironment becomes acidic, and the pH&#8208;switchable GPBO can target the bacteria of the wound site. The NIR&#8208;assisted GPBO treatment exhibits anti&#8208;bacterial effects with fast response, high efficiency, and long duration to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. GPBO achieves excellent photothermal imaging and CT imaging of the mouse subcutaneous abscess model. With the assistance of NIR irradiation, the GPBO promotes the healing of the diabetic wound model with the effects of anti&#8208;bacteria, anti&#8208;inflammation, the M2 polarization promotion of macrophages, and angiogenesis. This is the first&#8208;time report of nano&#8208;sized BiO1&#8208;xI. The synthesis and selected application for the imaging and targeted therapy of diabetic wounds are presented. This study offers an example of the NP&#8208;assisted precise diagnosis and therapy of bacterial infection diseases.

         <title>Endogenous Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation Enables Zn Capture to Reprogram Benign Hyperplastic Prostate Microenvironment and Shrink Prostate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogel (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is developed to capture Zn2+, alleviate local inflammation, scavenge ROS, inhibit glycolysis and chemotaxis, which are available to reprogram the microenvironment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and shrinking prostate especially after entrapping lonidamine.








Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the leading cause of urination disorder is still a refractory disease, and there have no satisfied drugs or treatment protocols yet. With identifying excessive Zn2+, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the etiology of aberrant hyperplasia, an injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogels (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation are developed to load lonidamine for reprogramming prostate microenvironment and treating BPH. Herein, SAGA hydrogels can crosslink with Zn2+ in BPH via coordination chelation and switch free Zn2+ to bound ones, consequently alleviating Zn2+&#8208;arisen inflammation and glycolysis. Beyond capturing Zn2+, GA with intrinsic immunoregulatory property can also alleviate local inflammation and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, Zn2+ chelation&#8208;bridged interconnection in SAGA enhances its mechanical property and regulates the degradation rate to enable continuous lonidamine release, favoring hyperplastic acini apoptosis and further inhibiting glycolysis. These multiple actions cooperatively reprogram BPH microenvironment to alleviate characteristic symptoms of BPH and shrink prostate. RNA sequencing reveals that chemotaxis, glycolysis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inflammation&#8208;related pathways associated with M1&#8208;like phenotype polarization are discerned as the action rationales of such endogenous Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ hydrogels, providing a candidate avenue to treat BPH.

         <title>Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lotus effect, a universal strategy is proposed for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. The effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism is demonstrated by designing the metal&#8211;organometallic compound layer with zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property, in which in situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic groups are constructed.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as an example, this work illustrates how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on the Zn metal anode. In situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups are constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which improves the electrochemical performance of the Zn||V2O5 full cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with water contact angle (CA) measurements demonstrate that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water CA and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how the excellent reversibility is achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIB anodes.

This work originates a chronological multi&#8208;immunotherapy combined with sonodynamic therapy against biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) based on macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated nanoadjuvants loaded with cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p for biofilm eradication under ultrasound. CPG&#8208;ODN promotes early&#8208;stage neutrophil extracellular trap formation while redirecting macrophage polarization. MiR&#8208;21&#8208;5p facilitates tissue integration and anti&#8208;inflammation in repairing phase. This approach offers valuable clinical benefits for BRIs&#8217; treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) present significant challenges owing to drug resistance, adverse immune responses, and implant failure; however, current approaches inadequately cater to the diverse therapeutic requirements at different stages of infection. To address this issue, a multi&#8208;immunotherapy strategy in combination with sonodynamic therapy is proposed for the chronological treatment of BRIs. Macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated targeting sonosensitive nanoadjuvants are fabricated to load cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or microRNA (miR)&#8208;21&#8208;5p. In the early stages of BRI (Stage I), CPG&#8208;ODN&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (CPG@HMPN@M) promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps to capture and neutralize detached microbes. During the late stage of infection (Stage II), CPG&#8208;ODNs redirect macrophage polarization into the M1 phase to combat infections via TLR9/Myd88/TRAF6 pathway. During these stages, CPG@HMPN@M generates singlet oxygen through sonodynamic processes, eradicating the biofilms under US irradiation. Once the BRIs are eliminated, miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (miR@HMPN@M) are delivered to the lesions to suppress excessive inflammation and promote tissue integration by evoking macrophage M2 polarization during the repair phase (Stage III) through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. This innovative approach aims to provide comprehensive treatment strategies for the chronological treatment of BRI by effectively eliminating infections, promoting tissue restoration, and implementing different immune regulations at different stages, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

         <title>19.32% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by Fine&#8208;Tuning Stacking Modes of Y&#8208;Type Molecule Acceptors: Synergistic Bromine and Fluorine Substitution of the End Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking modes of Y&#8208;type small molecule acceptors are fine&#8208;tuned by synergistic bromine and fluorine substitution of the end groups for achieving high power conversion efficiencies of 18.34% and 19.32% in binary and ternary blend devices.








Abstract
The success of Y6&#8208;type nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be attributed to their unique honeycomb stacking style, which leads to favorable thin&#8208;film morphologies. The intermolecular interactions related to the crystallization tendency of these NF&#8208;SMAs is closely governed by their electron accepting end groups. For example, the high performance Y6 derivative L8&#8208;BO (BTP&#8208;4F) presents three types of stacking modes in contrast to two stacking modes of Y6. Hence, it is ultimately interesting to obtain more insight on the packing properties and the preferences influenced by chemical modifications such as end group engineering. This work designs and synthesizes asymmetric and symmetric L8&#8208;BO derivatives with brominated end groups and explores the stacking preferences in various modes. The asymmetric BTP&#8208;3FBr displays an optimized crystallization tendency and thin film morphology, leading to a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34% in binary devices and a top PCE of 19.32% in ternary devices containing 15 wt% IDIC as the second acceptor.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sleek High Entropy Alloy Tights: Realizing Superior Cyclability for Anode&#8208;Free Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;sleek high&#8208;entropy alloy layer (&#8776;20&#160;nm) with nano particles arrays is tightly wrapped on the carbon fiber surface like tights (NiCdCuInZn HEA/C), promoting the homogeneous distribution of local current density that is more conducive to the Li metal homogeneous deposition. By using NiCdCuInZn HEA/C host, the anode&#8208;free Li metal battery achieves high reversibility cycles and capacity retention rate.








Abstract
The development of Li&#8208;free anodes to inhibit Li dendrite formation and provide high energy density Li batteries is highly applauded. However, the lithiophobic interphase and heterogeneous Li deposition hindered the practical application. In this work, a 20&#160;nm ultra&#8208;sleek high entropy alloy (HEA, NiCdCuInZn) tights loaded with HEA nanoparticles are developed by a thermodynamically driven phase transition method on the carbon fiber (HEA/C). Multiple Li+ transport paths and abundant active sites are enabled by the cocktail effect of different constituent elements in HEA. These active sites with gradient absorption energies (&#8722;3.18 to &#8722;2.03&#160;eV) facilitate selective binding, providing a low barrier for homogeneous Li nucleation. Simultaneously, multiple transport paths promote Li diffusion behavior with uniform Li deposition. Thus, the&#160;HEA/C achieves high reversibility of Li plating/stripping processes over 2000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, as well as over 7200&#160;h at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/60 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Moreover, the anode&#8208;free full cell with the HEA/C host has an average coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 1 C after 160 cycles. This advanced HEA structure design shows a favorable potential application for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries.

         <title>Novel Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D SbBi Alloy Structure with Precise Regulation Ratio Enables Long&#8208;Stable Potassium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D thin&#8208;layer binary SbBi alloy is designed, which displays superior 2D structural stability, highly reversible alloying/dealloying, fast K/Li storage kinetics, and ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycle stability in potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs).








Abstract
The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of 2D Sb or Bi limit their applications in high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;stability potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high&#8208;capacity Sb and high&#8208;stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one&#8208;step co&#8208;replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode exhibits high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode has a high&#8208;stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 (&#8776;87.8% retention) and an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling stability of 1000 cycles (0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism is revealed by kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra&#8208;stable structure and synergistic interaction within the 2D&#8208;binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K+ adsorption energy, and decreases the K+ diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D&#8208;Bi or 2D&#8208;Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of the (100) plane is realized by selective shielding of the (002) plane using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites hinders the future development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Despite that the (100) plane possesses better zincophilic ability and fast kinetics, dendrites are generally suppressed via (002) plane&#8208;oriented Zn deposition in previous reports; the ordered (100) plane&#8208;dominant Zn deposition, especially under high current density has not yet been realized. Herein, vertically&#8208;oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of (100) plane is reported using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. DLP is preferentially anchored on the Zn (002) crystal plane via the polar phosphate group, then the deposition of Zn atoms on the (002) plane is retarded by the long alkyl chain, finally promoting the preferred growth of the (100) plane. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell also cycles steadily for 700&#160;h with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides new insights into the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by crystal plane modulation.

         <title>Confinement Engineering of Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Triggered Charge Redistribution on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a confinement strategy between atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped porous carbon and metal nanoparticles is presented, which can induce the strong electronic coupling with adjacent nanoparticles and tune their electrocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.








Abstract
Optimizing the interaction between metal and support in the supported metal catalysts effectively refines the electronic structure and boosts the catalytic properties of loaded active components. Herein a method is introduced to confine ultrafine ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles within atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped carbon network (Ru/Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) through the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction, achieving superior catalytic activity and stability for alkaline hydrogen evolution. Spectroscopic data and theoretical modeling elucidate that the remarkable catalytic performance of Ru sites stems from their strong electronic coupling with neighboring Zn&#8208;N4 moiety and pyridinic N/pyrrolic N. This interaction induces an electron&#8208;deficient state of Ru, thereby accelerating the dissociation of H2O and lowering the energy barriers for the desorption of OH* and H*. This insight provides a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at play. Furthermore, alkaline water electrolyzer using this catalyst as cathode delivers a mass activity of 3&#160;A&#160;mgcat&#8211;1 at 2.0&#160;V, much surpassing Ru&#8208;C. This research opens a novel pathway for the development of advanced materials , tailored for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II Ratiometric Nanothermometers for 3D In Vivo Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometers with self&#8208;calibrating ability are constructed by assembling temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and temperature&#8208;sensitive Ag2S quantum dots into a hybrid nanocomposite material. The high thermal sensitivity, robust stability and calibration procedure enable accurate 3D thermographic imaging ex vivo and in vivo.








Abstract
Luminescent nanothermometry, particularly the one based on ratiometric, has sparked intense research for non&#8208;invasive in vivo or intracellular temperature mapping, empowering their uses as diagnosis tools in biomedicine. However, ratiometric detection still suffers from biased sensing induced by wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering, low thermal sensitivity (Sr), and lack of imaging depth information. Herein, this work constructs an ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometer with self&#8208;calibrating ability for 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, in which temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and strongly temperature&#8208;quenched Ag2S quantum dots are co&#8208;assembled to form a hybrid nanocomposite material. Precise control over the amount ratio between two sub&#8208;materials enables the manipulation of heat&#8208;activated back energy transfer from Ag2S to Yb3+ in lanthanide nanoparticles, thereby rendering Sr up to 7.8% &#176;C&#8722;1 at 43.5 &#176;C, and higher than 6.5% &#176;C&#8722;1 over the entire physiological temperature range. Moreover, the luminescence intensity ratio between two separated spectral regions within the narrow Yb3+ emission peak is used to determine the depth information of nanothermometers in living mice and correct the effect of tissue depth on 2D thermographic imaging, and therefore allows a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of accurate 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, constituting a solid step toward the development of advanced ratiometric nanothermometry for biological applications.

         <title>Cu@Co with Dilatation Strain for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a Cu@Co catalyst with dilatation strain is prepared for low&#8208;concentration NO electroreduction, and it exhibits high NH3 yield of 627.20 &#181;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 76.54%. The assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using Cu@Co as cathode achieves a power density of 3.08 mW cm&#8722;2, which can simultaneously realize NO removal, NH3 green synthesis, and electricity output. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a clean and sustainable strategy to simultaneously remove NO and synthesize NH3. However, the conversion of low concentration NO to NH3 is still a huge challenge. In this work, the dilatation strain between Cu and Co interface over Cu@Co catalyst is built up and investigated for electroreduction of low concentration NO (volume ratio of 1%) to NH3. The catalyst shows a high NH3 yield of 627.20&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 76.54%. Through the combination of spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and geometric phase analyses, it shows that Co atoms occupy Cu lattice sites to form dilatation strain in the xy direction within Co region. Further density functional theory calculations and NO temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NO&#8208;TPD) results show that the surface dilatation strain on Cu@Co is helpful to enhance the NO adsorption and reduce energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH), thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction. To simultaneously realize NO exhaust gas removal, NH3 green synthesis, and electricity output, a Zn&#8208;NO battery with Cu@Co cathode is assembled with a power density of 3.08&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 273.37&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coccoliths are microscopic crystal&#8208;arrays created by unicellular organisms. Coccoliths display diverse and intricate structures that surpass what can be currently synthesized. This research reveals that the nuanced morphology of coccolith crystals is governed by a delicate interplay between transport&#8208;limited and reaction&#8208;limited growth, mirroring processes observed in snowflake formation.








Abstract
Biogenic crystals present a variety of complex morphologies that form with exquisite fidelity. In the case of the intricate morphologies of coccoliths, calcite crystals produced by marine algae, only a single set of crystallographic facets is utilized. It is unclear which growth process can merge this simple crystallographic habit with the species&#8208;specific architectures. Here, a suite of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electron microscopies is used to follow both the growth trajectories of the crystals ex&#160;situ, and the cellular environment in&#160;situ, in the species Emiliania huxleyi. It is shown that crystal growth alternates between a space filling and a skeletonized growth mode, where the crystals elongate via their stable crystallographic facets, but the final morphology is a manifestation of growth arrest. This process is reminiscent of the balance between reaction&#8208;limited and transport&#8208;limited growth regimes underlying snowflake formation. It is suggested that localized ion transport regulates the kinetic instabilities that are required for transport&#8208;limited growth, leading to reproducible morphologies.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing System for Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing chemistry, employing a thermally stable bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic Ru&#8208;carbene catalyst and a Cu(I) activator, addresses the thermal instability challenges of previous self&#8208;healing chemistries, enabling self&#8208;healing in a polydicyclopentadiene thermoset which is initially cured at &#8776;200 &#176;C via frontal polymerization.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing offers promise for addressing structural failures, increasing lifespan, and improving durability in polymeric materials. Implementing self&#8208;healing in thermoset polymers faces significant manufacturing challenges, especially due to the elevated temperature requirements of thermoset processing. To introduce self&#8208;healing into structural thermosets, the self&#8208;healing system must be thermally stable and compatible with the thermoset chemistry. This article demonstrates a self&#8208;healing microcapsule&#8208;based system stable to frontal polymerization (FP), a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing process with a self&#8208;propagating exothermic reaction (&#8776;200 &#176;C). A thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type complex bearing two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands addresses limitations in conventional G2&#8208;based self&#8208;healing approaches. Under FP's elevated temperatures, the catalyst remains dormant until activated by a Cu(I) co&#8208;reagent, ensuring efficient polymerization of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) upon damage to the polyDCPD matrix. The two&#8208;part microcapsule system consists of one capsule containing the thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type catalyst dissolved in the solvent, and another capsule containing a Cu(I) coagent blended with liquid DCPD monomer. Using the same chemistry for both matrix fabrication and healing results in strong interfaces as demonstrated by lap&#8208;shear tests. In an optimized system, the self&#8208;healing system restores the mechanical properties of the tough polyDCPD thermoset. Self&#8208;healing efficiencies greater than 90% via tapered double cantilever beam tests are observed.

         <title>Multiple H&#8208;Bonding Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Storage and Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymeric solid&#8211;solid phase change material with high latent heat storage and superior mechanical strength is developed for thermal energy storage (TES and management through the construction of multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions within the polymer. This study provides new guidance for combining high TES density, robust mechanical properties, and sound thermal stability in one material.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) are considered among the most promising candidates for thermal energy storage and management. However, the application of SSPCMs is consistently hindered by the canonical trade&#8208;off between high TES capacity and mechanical robustness. In addition, they suffer from poor recyclability due to chemical cross&#8208;linking. Herein, a straightforward but effective strategy for fabricating supramolecular SSPCMs with high latent heat and mechanical strength is proposed. The supramolecular polymer employs multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions as robust physical cross&#8208;links. This enables SSPCM with a high enthalpy of phase transition (142.5 J g&#8722;1), strong mechanical strength (36.9&#160;MPa), and sound shape stability (maintaining shape integrity at 120 &#176;C) even with a high content of phase change component (97 wt%). When SSPCM is utilized to regulate the operating temperature of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, it significantly diminishes the battery working temperature by 23 &#176;C at a discharge rate of 3 C. The robust thermal management capability enabled through solid&#8211;solid phase change provides practical opportunities for applications in fast discharging and high&#8208;power batteries. Overall, this study presents a feasible strategy for designing linear SSPCMs with high latent heat and exceptional mechanical strength for thermal management.

         <title>Nanodiamond&#8208;Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of paramagnetic centers in nanodiamonds drives effective reduction in longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and relaxation of neighboring water molecules, resulting in bright appearance on T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance images. , Using in vivo chicken embryos, it is confirmed nanodiamonds can provide high contrast to noise ratio for tracking and cell labeling over periods of time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
Nanodiamonds (ND) hold great potential for diverse applications due to their biocompatibility, non&#8208;toxicity, and versatile functionalization. Direct visualization of ND by means of non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques will open new venues for labeling and tracking, offering unprecedented and unambiguous detection of labeled cells or nanodiamond&#8208;based drug carrier systems. The structural defects in diamonds, such as vacancies, can have paramagnetic properties and potentially act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The smallest nanoscale diamond particles, detonation ND, are reported to effectively reduce longitudinal relaxation time T1 and provide signal enhancement in MRI. Using in vivo, chicken embryos, direct visualization of ND is demonstrated as a bright signal with high contrast to noise ratio. At 24 h following intravascular application marked signal enhancement is noticed in the liver and the kidneys, suggesting uptake by the phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and in vivo labeling of these cells. This is confirmed by visualization of nanodiamond&#8208;labeled macrophages as positive (bright) signal, in vitro. Macrophage cell labeling is not associated with significant increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines or marked cytotoxicity. These results indicate nanodiamond as a novel gadolinium&#8208;free contrast&#8208;enhancing agent with potential for cell labeling and tracking and over periods of time.

         <title>Split&#8208;Type Magnetic Soft Tactile Sensor with 3D Force Decoupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensor has a sandwich&#8208;like layered structure, the top layer of which is a centripetally magnetized flexible magnetic film. It can realize the self&#8208;decoupling measurement of 3D forces and be used as a human&#8211;machine interface to control a robot. After replacing the flexible substrate, the split&#8208;type sensor enables flow rate measurement for route calculation and navigation on the water.








Abstract
Tactile sensory organs for sensing 3D force, such as human skin and fish lateral lines, are indispensable for organisms. With their sensory properties enhanced by layered structures, typical sensory organs can achieve excellent perception as well as protection under frequent mechanical contact. Here, inspired by these layered structures, a split&#8208;type magnetic soft tactile sensor with wireless 3D force sensing and a high accuracy (1.33%) fabricated by developing a centripetal magnetization arrangement and theoretical decoupling model is introduced. The 3D force decoupling capability enables it to achieve a perception close to that of human skin in multiple dimensions without complex calibration. Benefiting from the 3D force decoupling capability and split design with a long effective distance (&gt;20&#160;mm), several sensors are assembled in air and water to achieve delicate robotic operation and water flow&#8208;based navigation with an offset &lt;1.03%, illustrating the extensive potential of magnetic tactile sensors in flexible electronics, human&#8210;machine interactions, and bionic robots.

         <title>Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticle Reporters for High&#8208;Precision Urinalysis of In Situ Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) are used to develop urinal reporters with defined ligand valence and spacing. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and membrane proteins (MPs) exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under fluid microenvironment, enabling reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measuring the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters.








Abstract
The expression of disease&#8208;specific membrane proteins (MPs) is a crucial indicator for evaluating the onset and progression of diseases. Urinalysis of in situ MPs has the potential for point&#8208;of&#8208;care disease diagnostics, yet remains challenging due to the lack of molecular reporter to transform the expression information of in situ MPs into the measurable urine composition. Herein, a series of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDFs) are employed as the cores of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) to direct the self&#8208;assembly of PAN reporters with defined ligand valence and spatial distribution. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and MPs exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under renal tubule&#8208;mimic fluid microenvironment, thus enabling high&#8208;fidelity conversion of MPs expression level into binding events and reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measurement of the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters. Such PAN reporter&#8208;mediated signal transformation mechanism empowers urinalysis of the onset of acute kidney injury at least 6&#8201;h earlier than the existing methods with an area under the curve of 100%. This strategy has the potential for urinalysis of a variety of in situ membrane proteins.

         <title>Highly Stable Layered Coordination Polymer Electrocatalyst toward Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT) is developed to stabilize Cu2+ through Cu2+ and ethylenedioxythiophene coordination, which has high electrochemical and structural stability in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Cu2+&#8208;based materials, a class of promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals, usually undergo inevitable and uncontrollable reorganization processes during the reaction, resulting in catalyst deactivation or the new active sites formation and bringing great challenges to exploring their structure&#8211;performance relationships. Herein, a facile strategy is reported for constructing Cu2+ and 3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) coordination to stabilize Cu2+ ions to prepare a novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT). CuPEDOT enables selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 with 62.7% Faradaic efficiency at the current density of 354&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, and the catalyst is stable for at least 15&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu2+&#8208;EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO2RR and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH4 instead of dimerization to C2 products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu2+ prevents the reduction of Cu2+ ions during CO2RR. The finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Solvent Engineered CsPbI2.77Br0.23 Ink for Large&#8208;Area and Scalable High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbI2.77I0.23 slot&#8208;die inks are developed via the colloidal engineering of scalable large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Eco&#8208;friendly solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and 2&#8208;methoxyethanol are used. Film growth is controlled by varying the solvent ratio. The cells based on films prepared by slot&#8208;die coating exhibit an efficiency of 19.05%.








Abstract
The performance of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been assessed for typical compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), using a blade coater, slot&#8208;die coater, solution shearing, ink&#8208;jet printing, and thermal evaporation. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films is not well developed. This study develops, for the first time, an eco&#8208;friendly solvent engineered all&#8208;inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile (ACN), 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME), or a mixture of ACN and 2&#8208;ME to fabricate large&#8208;area CsPbI2.77Br0.23 films with slot&#8208;die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50 &#176;C). The perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of prepared with different solvent ratios are thoroughly examined and they are correlated with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated CsPbI2.77Br0.23 perovskite film, which is prepared from the eco&#8208;friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile&#160;(0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintains &#8776;91% of its original PCE after 1 month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. It is believed that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Meta&#8208;Display: Photoluminescence and Pumping Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The originally proposed design strategy for light&#8208;emitting meta&#8208;display not only intriguingly enables simultaneous and independent encoding of fluorescence and pump light, but also expands encoding freedom of different incident wavevector directions. The design strategy, which extends the capability of light&#8208;emitting metasurface to meet diverse requirements, can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.








Abstract
The advent of intelligent display devices has given rise to diverse and complex demands for miniature light&#8208;emitting devices. Light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces have emerged as a practical and efficient means of achieving precise light modulation. However, their practicality is limited by certain constraints. First, there is a need for further exploration of the ability to manipulate both pumping and emitting light simultaneously. Second, there is currently no encoding freedom in multi&#8208;dimensional emitting light. To address these concerns, using meta&#8208;atoms is proposed to encode both fluorescence and pumping light independently, and expand the encoding freedom with different incident wavevector directions. A light&#8208;emitting metasurface with quad&#8208;fold multiplex encoding meta&#8208;displays, including dual scattering images and dual fluorescence images, is further demonstrated. This design strategy not only manipulates both pumping and fluorescence light but also broadens encoding freedom for comprehensive multi&#8208;functionality. This can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.

         <title>Microstructured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer&#8208;Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities and Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microstructured leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer is synthesized for ionotronic sensors, achieving a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1 and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. The broad sensing range of the sensor within the high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. A wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors are highly demanded for artificial tactile sensing. Using ionic conductors as the dielectric layer has enabled ionotronic pressure sensors with high sensitivities owing to giant capacitance of the electric double layer (EDL) formed at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface. However, conventional ionotronic sensors suffer from leakage, which greatly hinders long&#8208;term stability and practical applications. Herein, a leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer as the dielectric layer for ionotronic sensors is synthesized. The mechanical and electrical properties of the polyelectrolyte elastomer are optimized, a micropyramid array is constructed, and it is used as the dielectric layer for an ionotronic pressure sensor with marked performances. The obtained sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1, a high upper detecting limit on the order of 1&#160;MPa, a fast response/recovery speed of &#8776;6&#160;ms, and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. Notably, the sensor retains a high sensitivity of 4.96 kPa&#8722;1 at 500&#160;kPa, and its broad sensing range within high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. The applications of the sensor as a wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated. Durable and highly sensitive ionotronic sensors potentialize high&#8208;performance artificial skins for soft robots, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and beyond.

         <title>Terahertz Liquid Biosensor Based on A Graphene Metasurface for Ultrasensitive Detection with A Quasi&#8208;Bound State in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of metasurface with graphene, which enables liquid detection. The study opens new avenues for the advancement of metasurfaces by establishing them as potent candidates for optical sensors with real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free capabilities.








Abstract
The concept of a quasi&#8208;bound state in a continuum (QBIC) has garnered significant attention in various fields such as sensing, communication, and optical switching. Within metasurfaces, QBICs offer a reliable platform that enables sensing capabilities through potent interactions between local electric fields and matter. Herein, a novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of QBIC with graphene is reported, which enables multidimensional detection. The proposed biosensor is distinctive because of its ability to discern concentrations of ethanol and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone in a wide range from 100% to 0%, by monitoring the changes in the resonance intensity and maximum wavelet coefficient. This approach demonstrates an excellent linear fit, which ensures robust quantitative analysis. The remarkable sensitivity of our biosensor enables it to detect minute changes in low&#8208;concentration solutions, with the lowest detection concentration value (LDCV) of 0.21&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1. 2D wavelet coefficient intensity cards are effectively constructed through continuous wavelet transforms, which presents a more accurate approach for determining the concentration of the solution. Ultimately, the novel sensing platform offers a host of advantages, including heightened sensitivity and reusability. This pioneering approach establishes a new avenue for liquid&#8208;based terahertz biosensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Responsive Sliver Peroxide&#8208;Nanocarrier Serves as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase Inhibitor for Combating Severe Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;responsive nanovesicle, Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, capable of a broad&#8208;spectrum metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibition is developed to address pneumonia caused by MBL&#8208;producing bacteria. The efficacy of these nanovesicles is validated in two infection models, evidenced by significant reduction of bacterial loadings, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels, and the recruitment of immune cells. This innovative approach presents a promising strategy for combating infections of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria.








Abstract
Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) represent a prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, rendering last&#8208;line carbapenem&#8208;related antibiotics ineffective. Here, a bioresponsive sliver peroxide (Ag2O2)&#8208;based nanovesicle, named Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, is developed as a broad&#8208;spectrum MBL inhibitor for combating MBL&#8208;producing bacterial pneumonia. Ag2O2 nanoparticle is first orderly modified with bovine serum albumin and polydopamine to co&#8208;load meropenem (MER) and [5&#8208;(p&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;ureido]&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide (TPCA&#8208;1) and then encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) aimed to target inflammatory lung tissue specifically. The resultant Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM effectively abrogates MBL activity by displacing the Zn2+ cofactor in MBLs with Ag+ and displays potent bactericidal and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, specific targeting abilities, and great bioresponsive characteristics. After intravenous injection, the nanoparticles accumulate prominently at infection sites through MM&#8208;mediated targeting . Ag+ released from Ag2O2 decomposition at the infection sites effectively inhibits MBL activity and overcomes the resistance of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria to MER, resulting in synergistic elimination of bacteria in conjunction with MER. In two murine infection models of NDM&#8208;1+ Klebsiella pneumoniae&#8208;induced severe pneumonia and NDM&#8208;1+ Escherichia coli&#8208;induced sepsis&#8208;related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduce bacterial loading, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL&#8208;producing carbapenem&#8208;resistant bacteria.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage in Tungsten Bronze Dielectric Ceramics Through a Weakly Coupled Relaxor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining high energy storage performance in tetragonal tungsten bronze dielectric ceramics is challenging, owing to the complexity of composition design and crystal structure. This study focuses on enhancing the recoverable energy density in Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8722;1.5xSmxNb2O6 by creating weakly coupled polar nanoregions. The resulting system exhibits ultrahigh energy storage, surpassing the majority of counterparts in ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze structures.








Abstract
Dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, known for their ultrafast discharge time and high&#8208;power density, find widespread applications in high&#8208;power pulse devices. However, ceramics featuring a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure (TTBs) have received limited attention due to their lower energy&#8208;storage capacity compared to perovskite counterparts. Herein, a TTBs relaxor ferroelectric ceramic based on the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8208;1.5xSmxNb2O6 composition, exhibiting an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 9 J cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 84% under an electric field of 660&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 is reported. Notably, the energy storage performance of this ceramic shows remarkable stability against frequency, temperature, and cycling electric field. The introduction of Sm3+ doping is found to create weakly coupled polar nanoregions in the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485Nb2O6 ceramic. Structural characterizations reveal that the incommensurability parameter increases with higher Sm3+ content, indicative of a highly disordered A&#8208;site structure. Simultaneously, the breakdown strength is also enhanced by raising the conduction activation energy, widening the bandgap, and reducing the electric field&#8208;induced strain. This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs&#8208;based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high&#8208;power pulse device applications.

This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs-based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high-power pulse device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peeling&#8211;Stiffening Self&#8208;Adhesive Ionogel with Superhigh Interfacial Toughness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel with a working mechanism in stark contrast to conventional cured and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives is reported. The ionogel incorporates two ionophilic repeating units with different associating affinities, allowing it to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft liquid&#8208;like dissipating state, and upon peeling, to dramatically stiffen to a phase&#8208;separated glassy state for superstrong adhesion.








Abstract
Self&#8208;adhesive materials that can directly adhere to diverse solid surfaces are indispensable in modern life and technologies. However, it remains a challenge to develop self&#8208;adhesive materials with strong adhesion while maintaining its intrinsic softness for efficient tackiness. Here, a peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel that reconciles the seemingly contradictory properties of softness and strong adhesion is reported. The ionogel contains two ionophilic repeating units with distinct associating affinities, which allows to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft dissipating state for adhering, and to dramatically stiffen to the glassy state upon peeling. The corresponding modulus increases by 117 times driven by strain&#8208;rate&#8208;induced phase separation, which greatly suppresses crack propagation and results in a super high interfacial toughness of 8046 J m&#8722;2. The self&#8208;adhesive ionogel is also transparent, self&#8208;healable, recyclable, and can be easily removed by simple moisture treatment. This strategy provides a new way to design high&#8208;performance self&#8208;adhesive materials for intelligent soft devices.

         <title>Frank Partial Dislocations in Coplanar Ir/C Ultrathin Nanosheets Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets consisting of Ir nanoparticles with rich Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) and carbon in a coplanar structure (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) are synthesized first by using a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200&#160;&#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. The Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent catalytic performance due to ultrathin nanosheet structures with both FPDs and coplanar surfaces.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable acidic hydrogen evolution catalysts is of great significance and challenge for the long&#8208;term operation of commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this work, coplanar ultrathin nanosheets composed of rich&#8208;Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) are first synthesized. Ir nanoparticles and carbon (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) use a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200 &#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a remarkably high mass activity of 6.64 A mg&#8722;1 at 50 mV, which is among the best Ir&#8208;based catalysts.In addition, Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs are able to operate stably at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 200 h as a cathode in a PEM electrolyser, and the original coplanar ultrathin nanosheets structure are maintained after the test, demonstrating excellent stability against stacking and agglomeration. Geometrical phase analysis and theoretical calculations show that the FPDs produce a 4% compressive strain in the Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs, and the compressive strain weaken the adsorption of H* by Ir, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescence Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophore is synthesized and developed into a water&#8208;soluble activatable probe (CalCL) for in vivo imaging of drug&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has a high prevalence but is poorly managed for cancer patients due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques. Molecular optical imaging can provide a noninvasive way for real&#8208;time monitoring of CIPN; However, this is not reported, likely due to the absence of optical probes capable of imaging deep into the spinal canal and possessing sufficient sensitivity for minimal dosage through local injection into the dorsal root ganglia. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophore (MPBD) with a chemiluminescence quantum yield higher than other reported probes is synthesized and a NIR activatable chemiluminescent probe (CalCL) is developed for in vivo imaging of CIPN. CalCL is constructed by caging MPBD with calpain&#8208;cleavable peptide moiety while conjugating polyethylene glycol chain to endow water solubility. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue penetration of chemiluminescence and specific turn&#8208;on response of CalCL toward calpain (a hallmark of CIPN), it allows for sensitive detection of paclitaxel&#8208;mediated CIPN in living mice, which is unattainable by fluorescence imaging. This study thus not only develops a highly efficient chemiluminescent probe, but also presents the first optical imaging approach toward high&#8208;throughput screening of neurotoxic drugs.

         <dc:description>
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in harsh environments. A new&#8208;type hydrated eutectic electrolyte is developed to in situ form a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase, thereby improving the reversibility of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) encounters challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in battery performance under harsh environments. Here, a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O, ethylene glycol (EG), and InCl3 solution is introduced to effectively extend the lifespan of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the H2O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual&#8208;interaction, involving coordination with Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques reveal that HEE in situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation&#8208;reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase are further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy of nonepitaxial synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates is presented. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. The findings of this study provide a universal epitaxial platform for single&#8208;crystal 2D material production.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation nanodevices require 2D material synthesis on insulating substrates. However, growing high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene, on insulators is challenging owing to the lack of suitable metal catalysts, imperfect lattice matching with substrates, and other factors. Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high&#8208;quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies being explored. Herein, a universal strategy is introduced for the nonepitaxial synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. High&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area, single&#8208;crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single&#8208;crystal film production.

         <title>Longevous Cycling of Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by &#8220;Raisin&#8208;Bread&#8221; Cobalt Oxynitride/Porous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
The design of &#8220;Raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture for bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst enables the Zn&#8208;air battery to exhibit a longevous cyclability exceeding 1350&#160;h. It is realized through synergistic combination of (i) cobalt oxynitride as the protective shell, (ii) defect&#8208;rich active sites resulting from in&#8208;situ nitridation and strong coupling between cobalt raisin and surrounding 3D conductive bread, and (iii) enhanced mass and charge transportation via the boosted active surface and porosity.








Abstract
Developing commercially viable electrocatalyst lies at the research hotspot of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, but it is still challenging to meet the requirements of energy efficiency and durability in realistic applications. Strategic material design is critical to addressing its drawbacks in terms of sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions and limited battery lifespan. Herein, a &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture is designed for a hybrid catalyst constituting cobalt nitride as the core nanoparticle with thin oxidized coverings, which is further deposited within porous carbon aerogel. Based on synchrotron&#8208;based characterizations, this hybrid provides oxygen vacancies and Co&#8208;Nx&#8208;C sites as the active sites, resulting from a strong coupling between CoOxNy nanoparticles and 3D conductive carbon scaffolds. Compared to the oxide reference, it performs enhanced stability in harsh electrocatalytic environments, highlighting the benefits of the oxynitride. Furthermore, the 3D conductive scaffolds improve charge/mass transportation and boost durability of these active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduced N species into hybrid can synergistically tune the d&#8208;band center of cobalt and improve its bifunctional activity. As a result, the obtained air cathode exhibits bifunctional overpotential of 0.65&#160;V and a battery lifetime exceeding 1350 h, which sets a new record for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery reported so far.

         <title>Specific Propyne Trapping Sites within a Robust MOF for Efficient Propyne/Propadiene Separation with Record Propadiene Productivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust metal organic framework CuZrF6&#8208;TPA with specific propyne trapping sites and multiple supramolecular interactions is reported for benchmark propyne/propadiene separation with record productivity of pure propadiene (4.7 mol L&#8722;1).








Abstract
Separating propyne/propadiene to produce pure propadiene is extremely challenging in industry due to their similar properties. Herein, a novel ZrF62&#8722; anion pillared cage&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (termed as CuZrF6&#8208;TPA) for highly efficient propyne/propadiene separation is reported. It exhibits high propyne capacity (177.4/188.6 cm3/cm3 at 0.5/1.0 bar and 298 K), benchmark separation selectivity (6.0), and remarkable separation potential (5.7 mol L&#8722;1) simultaneously. Record propadiene productivity (&#8776;4.7 mol L&#8722;1) is achieved through a single adsorption process in breakthrough experiments with excellent recycle stability even under humid conditions. Based on the structure of propyne&#8208;loaded single crystals, two binding sites are identified, including a major propyne trapping site at the windows and a minor binding site located in the large cages. Modelling studies further confirm that the contracted cage windows surrounded with rotating Lewis basic F atoms and aromatic rings are the optimal bonding sites to capture propyne with multiple hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

         <title>&#8220;Soggy&#8208;Sand&#8221; Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8216;Soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes are designed for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By acting to decrease the water molecules' reactivity, aiding in uniform zinc deposition, and capturing anions to hasten Zn2+ transport, &#8216;soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes address several of the core challenges faced by conventional electrolytes. This work provides a new concept for activating the electrochemical properties of aqueous rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrites prevent the use of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte&#8208;insulator dispersions) are developed for achieving high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;ion batteries. How these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes is revealed. The oxide additions adsorb water molecules and trap anions, causing a network of space charge layers with increased Zn2+ transference number and reduced interfacial resistance. They beneficially modify the hydrogen bond network and solvation structures, thereby influencing the mechanical and electrochemical properties, and causing the Mn2+ in the solution to be oxidized. As a result, the best performing Al2O3&#8208;based &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolyte exhibits a long life&#160;of 2500 h in Zn||Zn cells. Furthermore, it increases the charging cut&#8208;off voltage for Zn/MnO2 cells to 2&#160;V, achieving higher specific capacities. Even with amass loading of 10 mgMnO2 cm&#8722;2, it yields a promising specific capacity of 189 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The concept of &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; chemistry provides a new approach to design powerful and universal electrolytes for aqueous batteries.

         <title>Enhancing Deep&#8208;Seated Melanoma Therapy through Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Microneedle Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch (termed F&#8208;MN patch) that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG), aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. The F&#8208;MN patch harnesses personal mechanical movements to generate electrical energy, driving delivered therapeutic drugs to deeper locations in the skin and achieving superior therapeutic efficacy in treating solid tumors in deep site.








Abstract
Effective treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors relies on enhanced drug penetration in transdermal drug delivery systems. While microneedles (MNs) and iontophoresis techniques have shown improved transdermal drug delivery efficiency, challenges such as skin elasticity, high electrical resistance of the stratum corneum, and external power supply requirements hinder their efficacy in treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. In this study, a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is presented, aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. MNs are composed of water&#8208;soluble materials mixed with negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with therapeutic drugs. The F&#8208;TENG harnesses personal mechanical movements generate electrical energy. Leveraging the advantages of both MNs and F&#8208;TENG, therapeutic NPs can penetrate deep skin locations upon MN patch insertion, releasing drugs rapidly in acidic tumor tissues. Owing to these features, a single administration of the integrated MN&#8208;patch in a mouse model with deep&#8208;seated melanoma exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting deep&#8208;located tumor compared to using the MN&#8208;patch alone, indicating promising potential for treating tumors at deep sites.

         <title>Negative Enthalpy Variation Drives Rapid Recovery in Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resilience of thermoplastic polyurethane continuously deteriorates during long&#8208;range deformation, mainly caused by the dynamics of the physical crosslink networks. This study clarifies the effect of negative enthalpy variation on long&#8208;range resilience through the construction elastomers with dual soft segments. This approach supplements the classic theory of entropy elasticity, which traditionally ignores intermolecular interactions.








Abstract
The mechanism behind the resilience of polymeric materials, typically attributed to the well&#8208;established entropy elasticity, often ignores the contribution of enthalpy variation (&#916;H), because it is based on the assumption of an ideal chain. However, this model does not fully account for the reduced resilience of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) during long&#8208;range deformation, which is mainly caused by the dynamics of physical crosslink networks. Such reduction is undesirable for long&#8208;range stretchable TPU considering its wide application range. Therefore, a negative &#916;H effect is established in this work to facilitate instant recovery in long&#8208;range stretchable TPU, achieved by constructing a reversible interim interface via strain&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the newly constructed dual soft segmental TPU shows resilience efficiency exceeding 95%, surpassing many synthetic high&#8208;performance TPUs with typical efficiencies below 80%, and comparable to biomaterials. Moreover, a remarkable hysteresis loop with a ratio exceeding 50%, makes it a viable candidate for applications such as artificial ligaments or buffer belts. The research also clarifies structural factors influencing resilience, including the symmetry of the dual soft segments and the content of hard segments, offering valuable insights for the design of highly resilient long&#8208;range stretchable elastomers.

         <title>Unconventional Synthesis of Hierarchically Twinned Copper as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrate&#8211;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is developed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical twin boundary networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. It is found that the HTBs can significantly promote the Cu&#8208;catalyzed reduction of nitrate to generate ammonia.








Abstract
Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites, and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, a surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is proposed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy, the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8211;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single&#8208;oriented TB and without TB. It is discovered that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO2*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and subsequent NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.

         <title>Thermal Disorder&#8208;Induced Strain and Carrier Localization Activate Reverse Halide Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) over light&#8208;induced strain can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient responsible for segregation. Simultaneously, dynamic disorder&#8208;inducing polaron localization significantly reduces excess carrier density, thereby mitigating the impact of light&#8208;induced strain. As a result, entropy dominates the system's free energy. These insights highlight the importance of strain homogenization for stable&#8208;phase, mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.








Abstract
The reversal of halide ions is studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localization of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) can be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice can mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder is estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#160;&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain is 0.23%. However, in situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increases the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Layered Perovskite Coated with In Situ Exsolved Core&#8208;Shell CuFe@FeOx Nanoparticles for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a new SOEC cathode material is reported for CO2 electrolysis, composed of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in both the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate and the FeOx shell facilitates the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE&#8208;PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeOx shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO2 into CO, reducing CO2 emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here a new SOEC cathode is reported for CO2 electrolysis consisting of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe alloy@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN&#8208;CFA@FeO cathode exhibit a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 for CO2 reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200 h under 0.75 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO2. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeOx shell, in contrast to conventional in situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB), thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Here a new SOEC cathode material is reported for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis, composed of high-entropy Pr&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;(CuFe)&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (HE-PSCFMMN) perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core-shell structured CuFe@FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in both the HE-PSCFMMN substrate and the FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; shell facilitates the extension of the triple-phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE-PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO, reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here a new SOEC cathode is reported for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis consisting of high-entropy Pr&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;(CuFe)&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (HE-PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core-shell structured CuFe alloy@FeO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE-PSCFMMN-CFA@FeO cathode exhibit a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200 h under 0.75 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE-PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; shell, in contrast to conventional in situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple-phase boundary (TPB), thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Growth of High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Crystal Twisted Bilayer Graphene on Liquid Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for single&#8208;crystal TBG with a wide range of twist angles on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, high crystallinity, thermal stability, stacking structure, growth mechanism, and electrical transport properties of as&#8208;grown TBG are investigated. This work provides a convenient avenue for investigating the physical properties of TBG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) generates significant attention in the fundamental research of 2D materials due to its distinct twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent properties. Exploring the efficient production of TBG with a wide range of twist angles stands as one of the major frontiers in moir&#233; materials. Here, the local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal TBG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176; on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, pristine interface, high crystallinity, and thermal stability of TBG are verified by using comprehensive characterization techniques including optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. The proportion of TBG in bilayer graphene reaches as high as 89%. In addition, the stacking structure and growth mechanism of TBG are investigated, revealing that the second graphene layer develops beneath the first one. A series of comparative experiments illustrates that the liquid copper surface, with its excellent fluidity, promotes the growth of TBG. Electrical measurements show the twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent electronic properties of as&#8208;grown TBG, achieving a room&#8208;temperature carrier mobility of 26640 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This work provides an approach for the in situ preparation of 2D twisted materials and facilitates the application of TBG in the fields of electronics.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Controlled Growth of rBN Crystalline Films with High Nonlinear Optical Conversion Efficiency up to 1%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stacking&#8208;controlled continuous precipitation strategy is proposed to synthesize uniform rBN crystalline films (lateral size of 2 &#215; 1 cm2, thickness of &gt;1&#160;&#181;m) on the vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal. The rBN films with parallel stacked layers exhibit ultrahigh nonlinear optical response with the record&#8208;high frequency conversion efficiency of 1% in the 2D&#8208;material family.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical crystals lie at the core of ultrafast laser science and quantum communication technology. The emergence of 2D&#160;materials provides a revolutionary potential for nonlinear optical crystals due to their exceptionally high nonlinear coefficients. However, uncontrolled stacking orders generally induce the destructive nonlinear response due to the optical phase deviation in different 2D layers. Therefore, conversion efficiency of 2D nonlinear crystals is typically limited to less than 0.01% (far below the practical criterion of &gt;1%). Here, crystalline films of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) with parallel stacked layers are controllably synthesized. This success is realized by the utilization of vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal, where both the unidirectional arrangement of BN grains into a single&#8208;crystal monolayer and the continuous precipitation of (B,N) source for thick layers are guaranteed. The preserved in&#8208;plane inversion asymmetry in rBN films keeps the in&#8208;phase second&#8208;harmonic generation field in every layer and leads to a record&#8208;high conversion efficiency of 1% in the whole family of 2D materials within the coherence thickness of only 1.6&#160;&#181;m. The work provides a route for designing ultrathin nonlinear optical crystals from 2D materials, and will promote the on&#8208;demand fabrication of integrated photonic and compact quantum optical devices.

         <title>Covert Scattering Control in Metamaterials with Non&#8208;Locally Encoded Hidden Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resilience of symmetry&#8208;based scattering control against reverse engineering is experimentally achieved in a programmable cable network metamaterial with non&#8208;locally encoded hidden symmetry. An application to secure wired communications and the observation of exceptional points of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states are achieved in complex metamaterials without apparent symmetry, including cases with non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms.








Abstract
Symmetries and tunability are of fundamental importance in wave scattering control, but symmetries are often obvious upon visual inspection, which constitutes a significant vulnerability of metamaterial wave devices to reverse&#8208;engineering risks. Here, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that a symmetry in the reduced basis of the &#8220;primary meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; that are directly connected to the outside world is sufficient; meanwhile, a suitable topology of non&#8208;local interactions between them, mediated by the internal &#8220;secondary&#8221; meta&#8208;atoms, can hide the symmetry from sight in the canonical basis. Covert symmetry&#8208;based scattering control in a cable&#8208;network metamaterial featuring a hidden parity (P$\mathcal {P}$) symmetry in combination with hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;preserving and hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking tuning mechanisms is experimentally demonstrated. Physical&#8208;layer security in wired communications is achieved using the domain&#8208;wise hidden P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry as a shared secret between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Within the approximation of negligible absorption, the first tuning of a complex scattering metamaterial without mirror symmetry to feature exceptional points (EPs) of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states, as well as quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum, is reported. These results are reproduced in metamaterials involving non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms, including the first observation of reflectionless EPs in a non&#8208;reciprocal&#160;system.

         <title>Indoor Photovoltaic Fiber with an Efficiency of 25.53% under 1500 Lux Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized indoor photovoltaic fiber is designed with a photoanode made from a hybrid TiO2 layer on Ti wire and a counter electrode composed of an aligned carbon nanotube sheet on metal fiber, showing a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. These IPVFs can supply electricity for wearables, providing a mobile power solution indoors.








Abstract
Photovoltaic devices represent an efficient electricity generation mode. Integrating them into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronic textiles&#8212;with the ultimate goal of supplying power for wearable technology&#8212;which is poised to change how electronic devices are designed. Many human activities occur indoors, so realizing indoor photovoltaic fibers (IPVFs) that can be woven into textiles to power wearables is critical, although currently unavailable. Here, a dye&#8208;sensitized IPVF is constructed by incorporating titanium dioxide nanoparticles into aligned nanotubes to produce close contact and stable interfaces among active layers on a curved fiber substrate, thus presenting efficient charge transport and low charge recombination in the photoanode. With the combination of highly conductive core&#8211;sheath Ti/carbon nanotube fiber as a counter electrode, the IPVF shows a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. Its performance variation is below 5% after bending, twisting, or pressing for 1000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient dye-sensitized indoor photovoltaic fiber is designed with a photoanode made from a hybrid TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer on Ti wire and a counter electrode composed of an aligned carbon nanotube sheet on metal fiber, showing a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. These IPVFs can supply electricity for wearables, providing a mobile power solution indoors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photovoltaic devices represent an efficient electricity generation mode. Integrating them into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronic textiles&#8212;with the ultimate goal of supplying power for wearable technology&#8212;which is poised to change how electronic devices are designed. Many human activities occur indoors, so realizing indoor photovoltaic fibers (IPVFs) that can be woven into textiles to power wearables is critical, although currently unavailable. Here, a dye-sensitized IPVF is constructed by incorporating titanium dioxide nanoparticles into aligned nanotubes to produce close contact and stable interfaces among active layers on a curved fiber substrate, thus presenting efficient charge transport and low charge recombination in the photoanode. With the combination of highly conductive core&#8211;sheath Ti/carbon nanotube fiber as a counter electrode, the IPVF shows a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. Its performance variation is below 5% after bending, twisting, or pressing for 1000 cycles. These IPVFs are&#160;further integrated with fiber batteries as self-charging power textiles, which are&#160;demonstrated to effectively supply electricity for wearables, solving the power supply problem in this important direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Contact engineering combined with continuous processing yields fiber&#8208;organic electrochemical transistors and neuromorphic devices with mobility greater than 45 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and &#956;C* product greater than 1500&#160;F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The latest developments in fiber design and materials science are paving the way for fibers to evolve from parts in passive components to functional parts in active fabrics. Designing conformable, organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) structures using poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) fibers has excellent potential for low&#8208;cost wearable bioelectronics, bio&#8208;hybrid devices, and adaptive neuromorphic technologies. However, to achieve high&#8208;performance, stable devices from PEDOT:PSS fibers, approaches are required to form electrodes on fibers with small diameters and poor wettability, that leads to irregular coatings. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS&#8208;fiber fabrication needs to move away from small batch processing to roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll or continuous processing. Here, it is shown that synergistic effects from a superior electrode/organic interface, and exceptional fiber alignment from continuous processing, enable PEDOT:PSS fiber&#8208;OECTs with stable contacts, high &#181;C* product (1570.5 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and high hole mobility over 45 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Fiber&#8208;electrochemical neuromorphic organic devices (fiber&#8208;ENODes) are developed to demonstrate that the high mobility fibers are promising building blocks for future bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. The fiber&#8208;ENODes demonstrate synaptic weight update in response to dopamine, as well as a form factor closely matching the neuronal axon terminal.

         <title>Spatially Selective Solvation Structure by Electronegative Micro&#8208;Arrays for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) exhibits a high Li+ binding energy of &#8722;5.99 eV. With nHA micro&#8208;arrays on the Cu foil, a locally Li+&#8208;rich region forms at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which can promote the generation of aggregates (AGGs) of anions. The decomposition efficiency of anions is significantly improved, leading to the formation of a more protective solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film.








Abstract
For electrolytes with conventional lithium salt concentration, it is not easy to generate sufficient anion&#8208;derived beneficial inorganic components to stabilize the electrolyte&#8208;lithium metal anode interface due to the repulsion of the free&#8208;state anions by the anode. In this study, the above issues are solved through the strong interaction between electronegative materials and lithium ions (Li+). A locally high Li+ concentration strategy is proposed by preparing micro&#8208;arrays of electronegative nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) on the Cu foil. It is found that the oxygen&#160;atoms in the phosphate group (&#8208;PO4) of the nHA can strongly adsorb Li+ to form a locally Li+&#8208;rich region, which increases the probability of anions interacting with Li+. The formation of more Li+&#8208;coordinated anions at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface can reduce the Li+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier, and enable the anions to completely decompose into lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium nitride (Li3N) on the Li metal anode. The interfacial transfer dynamics is accelerated and the Li dendrites are effectively suppressed. Under high current density, the anode exhibits a long lifespan with high Coulombic efficiency and small polarization voltage. The nHA micro&#8208;arrays achieve the targeted solvation structure at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface while ensuring conventional lithium salt concentration in the bulk electrolyte.

Abstract
The development of intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) with a high efficiency is of significance for practical application. However, their efficiencies lag far behind those of rigid or even flexible counterparts. To address this issue, an advanced top&#8208;illuminated OPV is designed and fabricated, which is intrinsically stretchable and has a high performance, through systematic optimizations from material to device. First, the stretchability of the active layer is largely increased by adding a low&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus elastomer of styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;propylene&#8208;styrene tri&#8208;block copolymer (SEPS). Second, the stretchability and conductivity of the opaque electrode are enhanced by a conductive polymer/metal (denoted as M&#8208;PH1000@Ag) composite electrode strategy. Third, the optical and electrical properties of a sliver nanowire transparent electrode are improved by a solvent vapor annealing strategy. High&#8208;performance is&#8208;OPVs are successfully fabricated with a top&#8208;illuminated structure, which provides a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.23%. Additionally, by incorporating 5&#8211;10% elastomer, a balance between the efficiency and stretchability of the is&#8208;OPVs is achieved. This study provides valuable insights into material and device optimizations for high&#8208;efficiency is&#8208;OPVs, with a low&#8208;cost production and excellent stretchability, which indicates a high potential for future applications of OPVs.

         <title>Vacancy Defects Inductive Effect of Asymmetrically Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Fe&#9472;N3S1 Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction with High Turnover Frequency and Mass Activity</title>

An innovative method for synthesizing carbon&#8208;supported asymmetrically coordinated single&#8208;atom catalysts with abundant vacancy defects is reported for promoting the oxygen reduction reaction with high intrinsic activity.








Abstract
The development of facile, efficient synthesis method to construct low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important, yet still challenging. Herein, an atomically dispersed N, S co&#8208;doped carbon with abundant vacancy defects (NSC&#8208;vd) anchored Fe single atoms (SAs) is reported and a vacancy defects inductive effect is proposed for promoting electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized catalyst featured of stable Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites exhibits excellent ORR activity with high turnover frequency and mass activity. In situ Raman, attenuated total reflectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveal the Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites exhibit different kinetic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline solutions. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra&#160;reveal the ORR activity of Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst in different electrolyte is closely related to the coordination structure. Theoretical calculation reveals the upshifted d band center of Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites facilitates the adsorption of O2 and accelerates the kinetics process of *OH reduction. The abundant vacancy defects around the Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites balance the OOH* formation and *OH reduction, thus synergetically promoting the electrocatalytic ORR process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of facile, efficient synthesis method to construct low-cost and high-performance single-atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important, yet still challenging. Herein, an atomically dispersed N, S co-doped carbon with abundant vacancy defects (NSC-vd) anchored Fe single atoms (SAs) is reported and a vacancy defects inductive effect is proposed for promoting electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized catalyst featured of stable Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; active sites exhibits excellent ORR activity with high turnover frequency and mass activity. In situ Raman, attenuated total reflectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveal the Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; active sites exhibit different kinetic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline solutions. Operando X-ray absorption spectra&#160;reveal the ORR activity of Fe SAs/NSC-vd catalyst in different electrolyte is closely related to the coordination structure. Theoretical calculation reveals the upshifted d band center of Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; active sites facilitates the adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and accelerates the kinetics process of *OH reduction. The abundant vacancy defects around the Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; active sites balance the OOH* formation and *OH reduction, thus synergetically promoting the electrocatalytic ORR process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Multimodal and Accurate Human&#8211;Machine Interaction System for Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes high&#8208;performance hydrogel sensors enabled multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction system to address the issue of weak signals in human&#8211;computer interaction from stroke or myasthenia patients, which can detect high&#8208;quality electromyogram and muscle deformation signals and couple them to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;accuracy interaction.








Abstract
Human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, this work develops a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel&#8208;based sensors and a self&#8208;designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multichannel EMG signals, the multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human&#8211;machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI&#8208;powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.

         <title>Platinum Prodrug Nanoparticles with COX&#8208;2 Inhibition Amplify Pyroptosis for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immune Activation of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic polymer (PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) incorporating a Pt(IV) prodrug and indomethacin (In) is developed here. PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In can further self&#8208;assemble to form Pt&#8208;In NP, which overcomes the chemoresistance and amplifies cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Overall, this platform holds great promise for improving the immune response of platinum drugs, which presents a generalizable strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, an emerging mechanism of programmed cell death, holds great potential to trigger a robust antitumor immune response. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents can induce pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 activation. However, these agents also enhance cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression in tumor tissues, leading to drug resistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and significantly limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Here, an amphiphilic polymer (denoted as PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) containing both indomethacin (In, a COX&#8208;2 inhibitor) and platinum(IV) prodrug (Pt(IV)) is developed, which is responsive to glutathione (GSH). This polymer self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&#8208;In NP) that can disintegrate in cancer cells due to the GSH responsiveness, releasing In to inhibit the COX&#8208;2 expression, hence overcoming the chemoresistance and amplifying cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, Pt&#8208;In NP significantly inhibit tumor growth and elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, when combined with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) treatment, Pt&#8208;In NP demonstrate the ability to completely suppress metastatic tumors, transforming &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;. Overall, the sustained release of Pt(IV) and In from Pt&#8208;In NP amplifies platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced pyroptosis to elicit long&#8208;term immune responses, hence presenting a generalizable strategy for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin within 2D Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D sub&#8208;nanoconfined annealed graphene oxide membranes are constructed for efficient synthesis of aspirin in directional flow. The reaction shows &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented short reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculation indicates the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure plays an important role in the efficient reaction.








Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.

3D Printing
3D printing of nematic self&#8208;assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers allows orientation control on the fly. This method enables the creation of intricate patterns which offer potential applications in functional structures with stiffness gradients and crack&#8208;mitigation strategies. This approach also facilitates the study and replication of nature&#8208;inspired patterns through extrusion 3D printing, such as the anisotropy formed by living organisms. More details can be found in article number 2307444 by Kunal Masania and co&#8208;workers.

Nanodiamond
In article number 2310109, Metin Sitti and co&#8208;workers demonstrate paramagnetic centers in nanodiamond to provide strong signal enhancement in magnetic resonance images (MRI). The use of nanodiamond addresses the need for alternative non&#8208;metal based T1&#8208;contrast agents and challenges associated with the use of gadolinium based contrast agents for cell labeling and tracking.

         <title>Heterojunction Engineering of Multinary Metal Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of advanced semiconductor photocatalyst is of great significance for the realization of efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) via water splitting. This review comprehensively summarizes the representative construction strategies of multinary&#8208;metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts in PHE application, which provides guidance for accelerate the development of solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen and PHE via overall water splitting.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) via water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective path to solve the current energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterojunction photocatalysts, containing two or more semiconductors, exhibit better PHE rates than those with only one semiconductor owing to the altered band alignment at the interface and stronger driving force for charge separation. Traditional binary metal sulfide (BMS)&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, such as CdS, MoS2, and PbS, demonstrate excellent PHE performance. However, the recently developed multinary metal sulfide (MMS)&#8208;based photocatalysts possess favorable chemical stability, tunable band structure, and flexible element compositions, and have considerable potential to realize higher PHE rates than those of BMSs. In this review article, the mechanism of PHE is first elucidated and then various single and heterojunction MMS&#8208;based photocatalysts and their charge transfer behaviors and PHE performances are systematically summarized. A perspective on potential future research directions in this field is concluded.

         <title>Recent Advances in Multi&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing: Active Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;photon 3D laser printing is a rapidly growing field of interest for the fabrication of nano&#8208; and microscale 3D structures. This review highlights recent progress, challenges, and perspectives in four core areas of application, namely microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics as well as life sciences with special emphasis on the implementation of new active materials.








Abstract
Since the pioneering work of Kawata and colleagues in 1997, multi&#8208;photon 3D laser printing, also known as direct laser writing, has made significant advancements in a wide range of fields. Moreover, the development and commercialization of photocurable inks for this technique have expanded rapidly. One of the current trends is the transition from static to active printable materials, often referred to as 4D microprinting, which enables a new degree of control in the printed systems. This review focuses on four primary application areas: microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics, and life sciences, highlighting recent progress and the crucial role of active materials, including liquid crystalline elastomers, hydrogels, shape memory polymers, and composites, among others. It also addresses ongoing challenges and provides insights into the future prospects in the different fields.

         <title>Understanding and Utilizing Droplet Impact on Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Phenomena, Mechanisms, Regulations, Applications, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of small droplets on nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces make invaluable contributions to the big world. This review summarizes the phenomena and mechanisms of droplet impact dynamics, demonstrates the regulation strategies using surface engineering, and discusses their utilization in diverse applications. Understanding and utilizing droplet impact is of vital significance for illuminating a sustainable future.








Abstract
Droplet impact is a ubiquitous liquid behavior that closely tied to human life and production, making indispensable impacts on the big world. Nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces provide a powerful platform for regulating droplet impact dynamics. The collision between classic phenomena of droplet impact and the advanced manufacture of superhydrophobic surfaces is lighting up the future. Accurately understanding, predicting, and tailoring droplet dynamic behaviors on superhydrophobic surfaces are progressive steps to integrate the droplet impact into versatile applications and further improve the efficiency. In this review, the progress on phenomena, mechanisms, regulations, and applications of droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces, bridging the gap between droplet impact, superhydrophobic surfaces, and engineering applications are comprehensively summarized. It is highlighted that droplet contact and rebound are two focal points, and their fundamentals and dynamic regulations on elaborately designed superhydrophobic surfaces are discussed in detail. For the first time, diverse applications are classified into four categories according to the requirements for droplet contact and rebound. The remaining challenges are also pointed out and future directions to trigger subsequent research on droplet impact from both scientific and applied perspectives are outlined. The review is expected to provide a general framework for understanding and utilizing droplet impact.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of biomaterials presenting glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an emerging field. Some of these biomaterials are applied for regenerative medicine but in vivo GAGs are highly diverse. Here, the methods employed to understand the complexity of GAGs are reviewed. High&#8208;throughput methods are focused on comparing multiple parameters in the same experiment.








Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving the understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspective, the scientific community is encouraged to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into inkjet printing's (IJP) potential for precise drug delivery and personalized medicine. It explores pharma&#8208;inks in IJP, their formulation, components, and substrates. Various drug delivery routes are covered, while discussing how hardware, software, and artificial intelligence integration could improve IJP's precision and efficiency. Nevertheless, additional exploration and optimization are needed to fully harness IJP's capabilities in healthcare.








Abstract
Inkjet printing (IJP) is an additive manufacturing process that selectively deposits ink materials, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, to create 3D objects or 2D patterns with precise control over their structure and composition. This technology has emerged as an attractive and versatile approach to address the ever&#8208;evolving demands of personalized medicine in the healthcare industry. Although originally developed for nonhealthcare applications, IJP harnesses the potential of pharma&#8208;inks, which are meticulously formulated inks containing drugs and pharmaceutical excipients. Delving into the formulation and components of pharma&#8208;inks, the key to precise and adaptable material deposition enabled by IJP is unraveled. The review extends its focus to substrate materials, including paper, films, foams, lenses, and 3D&#8208;printed materials, showcasing their diverse advantages, while exploring a wide spectrum of therapeutic applications. Additionally, the potential benefits of hardware and software improvements, along with artificial intelligence integration, are discussed to enhance IJP's precision and efficiency. Embracing these advancements, IJP holds immense potential to reshape traditional medicine manufacturing processes, ushering in an era of medical precision. However, further exploration and optimization are needed to fully utilize IJP's healthcare capabilities. As researchers push the boundaries of IJP, the vision of patient&#8208;specific treatment is on the horizon of becoming a tangible reality.

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Ionohydrogels towards Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multifunctional flexible electronics present tremendous opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital age. One potential avenue to realize this goal is the integration of polyoxometalates (POMs) and ionic liquid&#8208;based gels, but the challenge of macrophase&#8208;separation due to poor compatibility, especially caused by repulsion between like&#8208;charged units, poses a significant hurdle. Herein, we vastly expand the possibilities of producing diverse and homogenous POMs&#8208;containing ionohydrogels by nanoconfining POMs and ionic liquids within an elastomer&#8208;like polyzwitterionic hydrogel using a simple one&#8208;step random copolymerization method. The incorporation of polyzwitterions provides a nanoconfined microenvironment and effectively modulates excessive electrostatic interactions in POMs/ILs/H2O blending system, facilitating a phase transition from macrophase&#8208;separation to a submillimeter scale worm&#8208;like microphase&#8208;separation system. Moreover, combining POMs&#8208;reinforced ionohydrogels with a developed integrated self&#8208;powered sensing system utilizing strain sensors and Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors has enabled efficient energy storage and detection of external strain changes with high precision. This work not only provides guidelines for manipulating morphology within phase&#8208;separation gelation systems, but also paves the way for developing versatile POMs&#8208;based ionohydrogels for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart flexible electronics.

         <title>Electrical Doping of Metal Halide Perovskites by Co&#8208;evaporation and Application in PN Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrical doping of semiconductors is a revolutionary development that enabled many electronic and optoelectronic technologies. While doping of many inorganic and organic semiconductors has been well&#8208;established, controlled electrical doping of metal halide perovskites is yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we achieve efficient n&#8208; and p&#8208;type electrical doping of metal halide perovskites by co&#8208;evaporating the perovskite precursors alongside organic dopant molecules. We demonstrate that the Fermi level can be shifted by up to 500 meV towards the conduction band and by up to 400 meV towards the valence band by n&#8208; and p&#8208;doping, respectively, which increases the conductivity of the films. The doped layers were employed in PN and NP diodes, showing opposing trends in rectification. Demonstrating controlled electrical doping by a scalable, industrially relevant deposition method opens the route to developing perovskite devices beyond solar cells, such as thermoelectrics or complementary logic.

         <title>Building Stable Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) for SPMBs activates the potassium channels in the PEO chain; the functional ions in situ construct a stable interlayer. The ISPE exhibits high ionic conductivity, high K+ ion transference number, and high electrochemical stability voltage, exhibiting stable electrochemical performance. A novel strategy for electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance stable SPMB pouch cells is presented.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (SPMBs) are promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems for their low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, full SPMBs are not yet reported due to the K dendrites, interfacial incompatibility, and limited availability of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Here, stable SPMBs using a new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) are presented. The functional ions reconstruct ion transport channels, providing efficient potassium ion transport. ISPE shows a combination of high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial compatibility, and electrochemical stability. In situ alloying and iodinated interlayer increase K metal compatibility for prolonged cycling with low polarization. Moreover, the ISPE enables SPMBs with Prussian blue cathode stable operation at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V, a superior rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling over 3000 cycles (4.2&#160;V vs K+/K) with an ultra&#8208;high coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. More importantly, a classic solid&#8208;state potassium metal pouch cell achieves 4.2&#160;V stable cycling over 800 cycles with a high retention of 93.6%, presenting a new development strategy for secure and high&#8208;performance rechargeable solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries.

However, it is a challenge to design efficient and facile sensing materials for the detection of in&#8208;situ temperature of a working LIB. Herein, we develop a ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber and perform real&#8208;time temperature monitoring with a measurement accuracy of 0.12&#160;&#176;C, and the feasibility based on this polymer optical fiber composed of NaLaTi2O6:Yb/Er phosphors is verified in a pouch&#8208;type battery. During the charging and discharging cycles, the in&#8208;situ temperature is instantaneously converyed, revealing the internal situation of LIB. We further dwell on the thermal characteristics in constant current (CC) / constant voltage (CV) charging and CC discharging processes at different C&#8208;rates and the battery failure when operated at low temperature (0&#160;&#176;C). This work demonstrates an innovative strategy for operando solitary temperature monitoring conducted by ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber.

         <title>Topologically&#8208;protected quantum logic gates with valley&#8208;Hall photonic crystals</title>

Abstract
Topological photonics provide a promising way to realize more robust optical devices against some defects and environmental perturbations. Quantum logic gates are fundamental units of quantum computers, which are widely used in future quantum information processing. Thus, constructing robust universal quantum logic gates is an important way forward to practical quantum computing. However, the most important problem to be solved is how to construct the quantum&#8208;logic&#8208;gate&#8208;required 2&#215;2 beam splitter with topological protection. Here, we report the first experimental realization of the topologically&#8208;protected contra&#8208;directional coupler, which can be employed to realize the quantum logic gates, including control&#8208;NOT and Hadamard gates, on the silicon photonic platform. These quantum gates not only have high experimental fidelities but also exhibit a certain degree of tolerances against certain types of defects. Our work paves the way for the development of practical optical quantum computations and signal processing.

         <title>Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent Processable and High&#8208;density Photo&#8208;patternable Polymer Semiconductors Enabled by Incorporating Hydroxyl Groups in the Side Chains</title>

Abstract
Polymer semiconductors hold tremendous potential for applications in flexible devices, which is however hindered by the fact that they are usually processed by halogenated solvents rather than environmentally more friendly solvents. We herein present an effective strategy to boost the solubility of high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductors in non&#8208;halogenated solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) by appending hydroxyl groups in the side chains. The results show that hydroxyl groups, which can be easily incorporated into the side chains, can significantly improve the solubility of typical p&#8208; and n&#8208;types as well as ambipolar polymer semiconductors in THF. Meanwhile, the thin films of these polymer semiconductors from the respective THF solutions show high charge mobilities. With THF as the processing and developing solvents these polymer semiconductors with hydroxyl groups in the side chains can be well photo&#8208;patterned in the presence of the photo&#8208;crosslinker, and the charge mobilities of the patterned thin films are mostly maintained by comparing with those of the respective pristine thin films. Notably, we successfully utilized THF as the processing and developing solvents to achieve high density photo&#8208;patterning with &#8764;82000 device arrays/cm2 for polymer semiconductors in which hydroxyl groups are appended in the side chains.

         <title>Salt&#8208;assisted vapor&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid growth of one&#8208;dimensional van der Waals materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We introduce the method of salt&#8208;assisted vapor&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid (VLS) growth to synthesize one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures of trichalcogenide van der Waals (vdW) materials, exemplified by niobium trisulfide (NbS3). The method uses a unique catalyst consisting of an alloy of Au and an alkali metal halide (NaCl) to enable rapid and directional growth. We demonstrate high yields of two types of NbS3 1D nanostructures, nanowires and nanoribbons, each with sub&#8208;ten nanometer diameter, tens of micrometers length, and distinct 1D morphology and growth orientation. We present strategies to control the location, size, and morphology of growth, and extend the growth method to synthesize other transition metal trichalcogenides, NbSe3 and TiS3, as nanowires. Finally, we describe the role of the Au&#8208;NaCl alloy catalyst in guiding VLS synthesis and discuss the growth mechanism based on the relationships we measure between structure (growth orientation, morphology and dimensions) and growth conditions (catalyst volume and growth time). These results introduce opportunities to expand the library of emerging 1D vdW materials to make use of their unique properties through controlled growth at nanoscale dimensions.

         <title>Anchoring Active Li Metal in Nutrients Transport Channel by In&#8208;Situ Formed Nucleation Sites Enabling Durable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium metal is the ultimate anode material for pursuing the increased energy density of rechargeable batteries. However, fatal dendrites growth and huge volume change seriously hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, a lithium host that preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles on vertical carbon vascular tissues (VCVT/CoSe) is designed and fabricated to resolve these issues, which provides sufficient Li plating space with a robust framework, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. Their inherent N sites coupled with the in&#8208;situ formed lithiophilic Co sites loaded at the interface of VCVT not only anchor the initial Li nucleation seeds but also accelerate the Li+ transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the Li2Se originated from the CoSe conversion contributions to constructing a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with high ionic conductivity. This optimized Li/VCVT/CoSe composite anode exhibits a prominent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#160;h with a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a commercial nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathode, the full&#8208;cell presents substantially enhanced cycling performance with 81.7% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Thus, this work reveals the critical role of guiding Li deposition behavior to maintain homogeneous Li morphology and pave the way to stable LMBs.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of High&#8208;quality Ultrathin Ferroelectric Magnesium Molybdenum Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of ultrathin, stable ferroelectric materials is crucial for advancing high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power electronic devices. Nonetheless, ultrathin ferroelectric materials are rare due to the critical size effect. Here, we present a novel ferroelectric material, magnesium molybdenum oxide (Mg2Mo3O8). High&#8208;quality ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 crystals have been synthesized using chemical vapor deposition. Ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 has a wide bandgap (&#8764;4.4&#160;eV) and nonlinear optical response. Mg2Mo3O8 crystals of varying thicknesses exhibit out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties at room temperature, with ferroelectricity retained even at a 2&#160;nm thickness. The Mg2Mo3O8 exhibits a relatively large remanent polarization ranging from 33 to 52 &#956;C/cm2, which is tunable by changing its thickness. Notably, Mg2Mo3O8 possess a high Curie temperature (&gt;980&#160;&#176;C) across various thickness. Moreover, the as&#8208;grown Mg2Mo3O8 crystals display remarkable stability under harsh environments. This work introduces nolanites&#8208;type crystal into ultrathin ferroelectrics. The scalable synthesis of stable ultrathin ferroelectric Mg2Mo3O8 expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and may prosper applications of ferroelectrics.

Abstract
The integration of nanomedicine and immunotherapy has presented a promising opportunity for treatment of cancer and diverse diseases. However, achieving spatiotemporal controllable immunotherapy with excellent efficacy and safety performances remains a significant challenge. This study develops a biodegradable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal response polymer nanoparticle (PTEQ) system. This platform exhibits intrinsic immunostimulatory properties while concurrently delivering siRNA targeting the programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 gene (siPD&#8208;L1), leveraging enhanced immune responses and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for safe and effective cancer therapy. In the CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, PTEQ, as an immune stimulant, significantly boosted the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group not only initiated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy but also promoted the activation and infiltration of T cells, M1 macrophage polarization, and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the TME, resulting in the complete elimination of tumors in 7/10 cases a 100% survival rate. In another in vivo vaccine experiments, all tumors on the right side were completely eliminated in the PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group, reaching a 100% tumor eradication rate. These findings underscore the potential of this strategy to overcome the limitations of current immunotherapeutic limitations and achieve immune therapy normalization.

         <title>Van der Waals Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals (vdW) force has been regarded as a versatile and universal potential. Nevertheless, whether vdW force can be used as an attractive potential for the crystallization of colloids remains to be proven. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids can reconfigure vdW force to optimal range in terms of colloidal crystallizations.








Abstract
A general guiding principle for colloidal crystallization is to tame the attractive enthalpy such that it slightly overwhelms the repulsive interaction. As&#8208;synthesized colloids are generally designed to retain a strong repulsive potential for the high stability of suspensions, encoding appropriate attractive potentials into colloids has been key to their crystallization. Despite the myriad of interparticle attractions for colloidal crystallization, the van der Waals (vdW) force remains unexplored. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids and the resulting vdW force can reconfigure the pair potential well depth to the optimal range between &#8722;1 and &#8722;4 kBT at tens of nanometer&#8208;scale colloidal distances. As such, colloidal crystals with a distinct liquid gap can be formed, which is evidenced by photonic bandgap&#8208;based diffractive colorization.

         <title>General Design Concept of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects, electronic properties, support and interface effects, coordination environment of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) and SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts play an important role in the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship of SASCs in 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR are discussed by combining characterization techniques and theoretical calculation.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environment&#8208;friendly features. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalysts for the in&#8208;depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship. In this review, the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&#8722; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years, are summarized. First, the elementary steps of the two pathways and the roles of key intermediates (*OOH and *OH) in the reactions are systematically discussed. Next, the influence of the size effect, electronic structure regulation, the support/interfacial effect, the optimization of coordination microenvironments, and the SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts applied in 2e&#8722; ORR are systematically analyzed. Besides, the developments of SASCs in 2e&#8722; WOR are also overviewed. Finally, the research progress of H2O2 electrosynthesis on SASCs is concluded, and an outlook on the rational design of SASCs is presented in conjunction with the design strategies and characterization techniques.

         <title>Developing Hypoxia&#8208;Sensitive System via Designing Tumor&#8208;Targeted Fullerene&#8208;Based Photosensitizer for Multimodal Therapy of Deep Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ)&#160;is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds, which can target tumors and achieve specific drug release in tumors. The powerful nanotherapy system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy possesses satisfactory oncolytic efficacy for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD&#8208;SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C70 consuming O2 for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C70&#8208;mediated PDT and hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia&#8208;sensitive system&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD&#8208;SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene&#8208;based hypoxia&#8208;sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors can provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.

         <title>Physicochemical Targeting of Lipid Nanoparticles to the Lungs Induces Clotting: Mechanisms and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that lung&#8208;tropic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing either a cationic or a positive zeta potential conferring ionizable lipid, induce massive thrombosis. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen and activating platelets. Specific anticoagulation techniques and tuning of LNP physical properties are shown to ameliorate thrombosis while preserving lung tropism.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become the dominant drug delivery technology in industry, holding the promise to deliver RNA to up or down&#8208;regulate any protein of interest. LNPs have mostly been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting in which LNP&#8217;s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. Here lung&#8208;tropic LNPs are examined, whose organ tropism derives from containing either a cationic or ionizable lipid conferring a positive zeta potential. Surprisingly, these LNPs are found to induce massive thrombosis. Such thrombosis is shown in the lungs and other organs, and it is shown that it is greatly exacerbated by pre&#8208;existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non&#8208;LNP nanoparticles, and even by lung&#8208;tropic ionizable lipids that do not have a permanent cationic charge. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen, which then activates platelets and thrombin. Based on these mechanisms, multiple solutions are engineered that enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while ameliorating thrombosis. The findings illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re&#8208;engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.

Here lung-tropic LNPs are examined, whose organ tropism derives from containing either a cationic or ionizable lipid conferring a positive zeta potential. Surprisingly, these LNPs are found to induce massive thrombosis. Such thrombosis is shown in the lungs and other organs, and it is shown that it is greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles, and even by lung-tropic ionizable lipids that do not have a permanent cationic charge. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen, which then activates platelets and thrombin. Based on these mechanisms, multiple solutions are engineered that enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while ameliorating thrombosis. The findings illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fracture&#8208;Resistant Stretchable Materials: An Overview from Methodology to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article comprehensively reviews recent advances in fracture&#8208;resistant stretchable materials and highlights their applications across various fields.








Abstract
Stretchable materials, such as gels and elastomers, are attractive materials in diverse applications. Their versatile fabrication platforms enable the creation of materials with various physiochemical properties and geometries. However, the mechanical performance of traditional stretchable materials is often hindered by the deficiencies in their energy dissipation system, leading to lower fracture resistance and impeding their broader range of applications. Therefore, the synthesis of fracture&#8208;resistant stretchable materials has attracted great interest. This review comprehensively summarizes key design considerations for constructing fracture&#8208;resistant stretchable materials, examines their synthesis strategies to achieve elevated fracture energy, and highlights recent advancements in their potential applications.

         <title>Actuating Liquid Crystals Rapidly and Reversibly by Using Chemical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical energy (fuels) and catalysis are used to drive reversible microactuation of liquid crystals and microbeads dispersed within them. Surface catalyzed reactions between H2 and O2 on Pd/Au surfaces are shown to drive rapid (occur within a second) and reversible reorientation of LCs over many cycles, resulting in reversible microactuation of beads using LC elastic forces.








Abstract
Microtubules and catalytic motor proteins underlie the microscale actuation of living materials, and they have been used in reconstituted systems to harness chemical energy to drive new states of organization of soft matter (e.g., liquid crystals (LCs)). Such materials, however, are fragile and challenging to translate to technological contexts. Rapid (sub&#8208;second) and reversible changes in the orientations of LCs at room temperature using reactions between gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are catalyzed by Pd/Au surfaces are reported. Surface chemical analysis and computational chemistry studies confirm that dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Pd/Au films reduces preadsorbed O and generates 1 ML of adsorbed H, driving nitrile&#8208;containing LCs from a perpendicular to a planar orientation. Subsequent exposure to O2 leads to oxidation of the adsorbed H, reformation of adsorbed O on the Pd/Au surface, and a return of the LC to its initial orientation. The roles of surface composition and reaction kinetics in determining the LC dynamics are described along with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of microactuation of beads. These results provide fresh ideas for utilizing chemical energy and catalysis to reversibly actuate functional LCs on the microscale.

         <title>Insight into Multiple Intermolecular Coordination of Composite Solid Electrolytes via Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a simple and effective composite solid electrolyte with multiple coordination to stabilize high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries is discovered, and the interface formation mechanism is visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The multiple coordination prevents the continuous decomposition of the polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites and establishing stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through the preferential decomposition of anions, thereby ensuring the long&#8208;term cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Polymer/ceramic&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSE) are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SLBs), benefiting from the combined mechanical robustness of polymeric electrolytes and the high ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes. However, the interfacial instability and poorly understood interphases of CSE hinder their application in high&#8208;voltage SLBs. Herein, a simple but effective CSE that stabilizes high&#8208;voltage SLBs by forming multiple intermolecular coordination interactions between polyester and ceramic electrolytes is discovered. The multiple coordination between the carbonyl groups in poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and the fluorosulfonyl groups in anions with Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 nanoparticles is directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation. Importantly, the multiple coordination in CSE not only prevents the continuous decomposition of polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites but also establishes stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through preferential decomposition of anions. The stable CSE and its inorganic&#8208;rich interphases enable Li||Li symmetric cells with an exceptional lifespan of over 4800 h without dendritic shorting at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high&#8208;voltage SLB with LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode displays excellent cycling stability over 1100 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. This work reveals the underlying mechanism behind the excellent stability of coordinating composite electrolytes and interfaces in high&#8208;voltage SLBs.

2D MXene material is widely studied in flexible pressure sensing due to its excellent electrical, mechanical, hydrophilic properties, rich surface groups, and controllable elemental composition. In order to further promote the practical application of MXene in flexible pressure sensors, the sensing types and mechanisms, material selection and mixing, device structural design and optimization, preparation strategies, and various applications of MXene&#8208;based flexible sensors are overviewed.








Abstract
In the past decade, with the rapid development of wearable electronics, medical health monitoring, the Internet of Things, and flexible intelligent robots, flexible pressure sensors have received unprecedented attention. As a very important kind of electronic component for information transmission and collection, flexible pressure sensors have gained a wide application prospect in the fields of aerospace, biomedical and health monitoring, electronic skin, and human&#8211;machine interface. In recent years, MXene has attracted extensive attention because of its unique 2D layered structure, high conductivity, rich surface terminal groups, and hydrophilicity, which has brought a new breakthrough for flexible sensing. Thus, it has become a revolutionary pressure&#8208;sensitive material with great potential. In this work, the recent advances of MXene&#8208;based flexible pressure sensors are reviewed from the aspects of sensing type, sensing mechanism, material selection, structural design, preparation strategy, and sensing application. The methods and strategies to improve the performance of MXene&#8208;based flexible pressure sensors are analyzed in details. Finally, the opportunities and challenges faced by MXene&#8208;based flexible pressure sensors are discussed. This review will bring the research and development of MXene&#8208;based flexible sensors to a new high level, promoting the wider research exploitation and practical application of MXene materials in flexible pressure sensors.

         <title>Weak Electrostatic Force on K+ in Gel Polymer Electrolyte Realizes High Ion Transference Number for Quasi Solid&#8208;State Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups is revealed. Thus, a unique K&#8208;ion conducting in situ multilayered gel polymer electrolyte (K&#8208;ISMGPE), which can enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics and inhibit the dendrite growth, is designed. These properties endow it with high ionic conductivity and ion transference number at room temperature. Potassium&#8208;ion batteries using K&#8208;ISMGPE possess superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SSPIBs) are of great potential for commercial use due to the abundant reserves and cost&#8208;effectiveness of resources, as well as high safety. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport are necessary for SSPIBs. Here, the weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups in the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer chains, which can promote fast migration of free K+, is revealed. To further enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics, a multilayered GPE by in situ growth of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) on ETPTA (PVDF&#8208;HFP|ETPTA|PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed to improve the interface contact and provide sufficient K+ concentration in PVDF&#8208;HFP. A high ion transference number (0.92) and a superior ionic conductivity (5.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) are achieved. Consequently, the SSPIBs with both intercalation&#8208;type (PB) and conversion&#8208;type (PTCDA) cathodes show the best battery performance among all reported SSPIBs of the same cathode. These findings demonstrate that potassium&#8208;ion batteries have the potential to surpass Li/Na ion batteries in solid&#8208;state systems.

Thus, a unique K-ion conducting in situ multilayered gel polymer electrolyte (K-ISMGPE), which can enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics and inhibit the dendrite growth, is designed. These properties endow it with high ionic conductivity and ion transference number at room temperature. Potassium-ion batteries using K-ISMGPE possess superior electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-solid-state potassium-ion batteries (SSPIBs) are of great potential for commercial use due to the abundant reserves and cost-effectiveness of resources, as well as high safety. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport are necessary for SSPIBs. Here, the weak electrostatic force between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and electronegative functional groups in the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer chains, which can promote fast migration of free K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is revealed. To further enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics, a multilayered GPE by in situ growth of poly(vinylidenefluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) on ETPTA (PVDF-HFP|ETPTA|PVDF-HFP) is constructed to improve the interface contact and provide sufficient K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in PVDF-HFP. A high ion transference number (0.92) and a superior ionic conductivity (5.15 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved. Consequently, the SSPIBs with both intercalation-type (PB) and conversion-type (PTCDA) cathodes show the best battery performance among all reported SSPIBs of the same cathode. These findings demonstrate that potassium-ion batteries have the potential to surpass Li/Na ion batteries in solid-state systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Ultratough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels with Centimeter&#8208;Scale Fractocohesive Lengths via Inelastic Crack Blunting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractocohesive length measures the flaw sensitivity of materials. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant the material is. Synthetic soft materials have short fractocohesive lengths, often around 1 mm. Highly flaw&#8208;insensitive single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous network of distributed chain lengths are designed, demonstrating a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels.








Abstract
Fractocohesive length, defined as the ratio of fracture toughness to work of fracture, measures the sensitivity of materials to fracture in the presence of flaws. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant and crack&#8208;resistant the hydrogel. For synthetic soft materials, the fractocohesive length is short, often on the scale of 1&#8197;mm. Here, highly flaw&#8208;insensitive (HFI) single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous polymer network of widely distributed chain lengths are designed. The HFI hydrogels demonstrate a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length of 2.21&#160;cm, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels, and an unprecedented fracture toughness of &#8776;13&#160;300 J m&#8722;2. The uncommon flaw insensitivity results from the inelastic crack blunting inherent to the highly inhomogeneous network. When the HFI hydrogel is stretched, a large number of short chains break while coiled long chains can disentangle, unwind, and straighten, producing large inelastic deformation that substantially blunts the crack tip in a plastic manner, thereby deconcentrating crack&#8208;tip stresses and blocking crack extension. The flaw&#8208;insensitive design strategy is applicable to various hydrogels such as polyacrylamide and poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels and enables the development of HFI soft composites.

A feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs is proposed to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment. Under the catalysis of carboxylesterase, Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic ciprofloxacin derivative and chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
The presence of bacteria in tumor results in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and weakens the immune response in colorectal cancer. To overcome bacterium&#8208;induced chemotherapeutic drug resistance and potentiate antitumor immunity, herein a novel molecule Biotin&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;Cip&#8208;OH)&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;CPT)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Nap (Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap) is rationally designed containing four functional motifs (i.e., a biotin motif for targeting, Phe&#8208;Phe(&#8208;Nap) motif for self&#8208;assembly, ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) motif for antibacterial effect, and camptothecin (CPT) motif for chemotherapy). Using the designed molecule, a novel strategy of intracellular enzymatic nanofiber formation and synergistic antibacterium&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and immunotherapy is achieved. Under endocytosis mediated by highly expressed biotin receptor in colorectal cancer cell membrane and the catalysis of highly expressed carboxylesterase in the cytoplasm, this novel molecule can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic Cip&#8208;OH and chemotherapeutic drug CPT are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy towards colorectal cancer. This work offers a feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

         <title>Engineering Quantum Light Sources with Flat Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, precise sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift towards the utilization of &#8220;flat&#8221; optics with thickness at subwavelength scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness, scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate quantum light sources. Specifically, we&#160;explore the generation of entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down&#8208;conversion in nonlinear metasurfaces, as well as single photon emission from quantum emitters including quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials. The review covers theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. We&#160;discuss the diverse application range of these sources and highlight the current challenges and perspectives in the&#160;field.

Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices hold significant promise in wearable electronics owing to their capacity for green energy generation, temperature sensing, and comfortable wear. However, the simultaneous achievement of excellent multifunctional sensing and power generation poses a challenge in these devices. Here, ordered tellurium&#8208;based hetero&#8208;nanowire films are designed for flexible and multifunctional thermoelectric devices by optimizing the Seebeck coefficient and power factor. The obtained devices can efficiently detect both object and environment temperature, thermal conductivity, heat proximity, and airflow. Additionally, combining the thermoelectric units with radiative cooling materials exhibits remarkable thermal management capabilities, preventing device overheating and avoiding degradation in power generation. Impressively, this multifunctional electronics exhibits excellent resistance in extreme low Earth orbit environments. The fabrication of such thermoelectric devices provides innovative insights into multimodal sensing and energy harvesting.

         <title>Dendronized Polymer&#8208;Derived Nanomedicines for Mitochondrial Dynamics Regulation and Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The effects of dendron side chains in polymeric conjugates on tumor penetration and antigen presentation are systematically examined. Three polymer&#8208;gemcitabine (Gem) conjugates (pG0&#8208;Gem, pG1&#8208;Gem, pG2&#8208;Gem) are designed and prepared. The pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate uniquely binds to the mitochondria of tumor cells, thus regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The interaction between the pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate and the mitochondria promotes great penetration and accumulation of the conjugate at the tumor site, resulting in pronounced anti&#8208;tumor effects in an animal model. Such encouraging therapeutic effects can be ascribed to immune modulation since MHC&#8208;1 antigen presentation is significantly enhanced due to mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial metabolism alteration after pG2&#8208;Gem treatment. Crucially, the drug&#8208;free dendronized polymer, pG2, is identified to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and the regulation is independent of the conjugated Gem. Furthermore, the combination of pG2 or pG2&#8208;Gem with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in a remarkable tumor clearance rate of 87.5% and a prolonged survival rate of over 150 days, demonstrating the potential of dendronized polymers as an innovative nanoplatform for metabolic modulation and synergistic tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Giant Tunability of Rashba Splitting at Cation&#8208;Exchanged Polar Oxide Interfaces by Selective Orbital Hybrization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces exhibits extraordinary properties such as 2D superconductivity and ferromagnetism coupled to strongly&#8208;correlated electrons in narrow d&#8208;bands. In particular, 2DEGs in KTaO3 (KTO) with 5d t2g orbitals exhibit larger atomic spin&#8208;orbit coupling and crystal&#8208;facet&#8208;dependent superconductivity absent for 3d 2DEGs in SrTiO3 (STO). Herein, by tracing the interfacial chemistry, weak anti&#8208;localization magneto&#8208;transport behavior and electronic structures of (001), (110), and (111) KTO 2DEGs, we discovered unambiguously cation exchange across KTO interfaces. Therefore, the origin of the 2DEGs at KTO based interfaces dramatically different from the electronic&#160;reconstruction observed at STO interfaces. More importantly, as the interface polarization grows with the higher order planes in KTO case, the Rashba spin splitting becomes maximal for the superconducting (111) interfaces approximately twice that of the (001) interface. The larger Rashba spin splitting couples strongly to the asymmetric chiral texture of the orbital angular moment, and results mainly from the enhanced inter&#8208;orbital hopping of the t2g bands and more localized wave functions. Our finding has profound implications for the search for topological superconductors as well as the realization of efficient spin&#8208;charge interconversion for low&#8208;power spin&#8208;orbitronics based on (110) and (111) KTO interfaces.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Temperature Operated Ni&#8208;rich Cathode Stabilized by Thermal Barrier for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The pursuit of high energy density batteries has expedited the fast development of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation induced by local thermal accumulation and anisotropic lattice strain is posing great obstacles for its wide applications. Herein, we firstly report a highly&#8208;antioxidative BaZrO3 thermal barrier engineered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode through an In&#8208;situ construction strategy to circumvent the above issues. It is found that the Zr ions are incorporated to Ni&#8208;rich material lattice and influence on the topotactic lithiation as well as enhance the oxygen electronegativity through the rigid Zr&#8208;O bonds, which effectively alleviates the lattice strain propagation and decreases the excessive oxidization of lattice oxygen for charge compensation. More importantly, the BaZrO3 thermal barrier with an ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity validly impedes the fast heat exchange between electrode and electrolyte to mitigate the severe surface side reactions. This helps an ultra&#8208;high mass loading Li&#8208;ion pouch cell delivers a specific energy density of 690&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at active material level and an excellent capacity retention of 92.5% after 1400 cycles under 1C at 25 &#160;C. Tested at a high temperature of 55 &#160;C, the pouch type full&#8208;cell also exhibits 88.7% in capacity retention after 1200 cycles.

         <title>Octadecyl Gallate and Lipid&#8208;Modified MnSe2 Nanoparticles Enhance Radiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Promote Radioprotection in Normal Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using transcriptome data. Therefore, MnSe2&#8208;lipid with uniform sphere morphology and pH&#8208;responsive property is designed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosenstivity and Se element reduces side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a widely used therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is always limited by radioresistance of tumor tissues and side&#8208;effects on normal tissues. Herein, a signature based on four core genes of cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, is developed to predict prognosis and assess immune cell infiltration, indicating that the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in ESCC. A novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness is developed to simultaneously overcome radioresistance and reduce side&#8208;effects of radiation. The uniform MnSe2 encapsulated lipid effectively achieves tumor accumulation. Octadecyl gallate on surface of MnSe2 forming pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;phenolic covalent realizes rapid degradation in TME. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response by promoting secretion of cytokines and increasing white blood cells, and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy. Overall, this multifunctional remedy which is responsive to TME is capable of providing radiosensitivity by cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated immunostimulation and chemodynamic therapy, and radioprotection of normal tissues, is highlighted here to optimize ESCC treatment.

         <title>Interfacial Solar Evaporation: From Fundamental Research to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the development of interfacial solar evaporation technologies, covering the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance photothermal materials and solar evaporators, the energy nexus of 2D and 3D evaporation systems, and the corresponding energy management strategies, and the explored applications to solve practical issues. The summarized knowledge offers a perspective for future study and development of the field.








Abstract
In the last decade, interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG), powered by natural sunlight garnered significant attention due to its great potential for low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly clean water production in alignment with the global decarbonization efforts. This review aims to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements toward practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing the energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio&#8208;fouling issues in practical applications, are elucidated and contemporary methods are discussed to overcome these challenges. In the end, potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, are introduced, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. Based on the review and in&#8208;depth understanding of these aspects, the future research focuses are proposed to address potential issues in both fundamental research and practical applications.

         <title>Orbital Occupancy Modulation to Optimize Intermediate Absorption for Efficient Electrocatalysts in Water Electrolysis and Zinc&#8211;Ethanol&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the coordinating environment (coordinated atoms substitution and crystalline symmetry change) of the o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is successfully regulated to optimize its dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy. Additionally, the transformation of the ligand field caused by the reconstruction further modulates the spin configuration of the catalyst and the moderate dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy enhances the ethanol oxidiation.








Abstract
Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the metal d&#8208;orbital and the intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is prepared as pre&#8208;catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co3O4 is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites are introduced by Ni doping which enables the co&#8208;existence of four&#8208;coordinated sites and six&#8208;coordination sites in o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni. The dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy decreases after the atomic substitution, while increases after replacing the CoSe6&#8208;Oh field with CoSe6&#8208;Oh/CoSe4&#8208;Td. This work explores a new direction for the preparation of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis and innovative zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery.

Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o-c-CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni is prepared as pre-catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites are introduced by Ni doping which enables the co-existence of four-coordinated sites and six-coordination sites in o-c-CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni. The d&lt;i&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; + d&lt;i&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; orbital occupancy decreases after the atomic substitution, while increases after replacing the CoSe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; field with CoSe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. This work explores a new direction for the preparation of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis and innovative zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling&#8208;Mediated Sequential Drug Delivery Potentiates Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) to specifically remodel the tumor microenvironment by combining coagulation and hypoxia. Apitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3, a nanocarrier for immunotherapy, subsequently recognizes and targets tumor coagulation. Under hypoxia, IMDQ is selectively activated. This strategy boosts delivery efficacy and reduces systemic toxicity of IMDQ. It successfully eradicates 4T1 and CT26 tumors (500 mm3) without recurrence.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the de novo priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off&#8208;target toxicity. Here, this work describes a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4&#8208;NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide&#8208;decorated poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 conjugate, termed apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3). CA4&#8208;NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb&#8208;IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ is activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;&#8208;N3&#8221; to &#8220;&#8208;NH2&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirm their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8776;500 mm3 are eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Synthetic Sulfonamide&#8208;Based Solvent and Electrochemically Active Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are strategically designed by optimizing the electrolyte solvents and constructing stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine effectively mitigates the drawbacks of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane and facilitates the construction of a well&#8208;designed multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.








Abstract
Considering practical viability, Li&#8208;metal battery electrolytes should be formulated by tuning solvent composition similar to electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;ion batteries to enable the facile salt&#8208;dissociation, ion&#8208;conduction, and introduction of sacrificial additives for building stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Although 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane with a high&#8208;donor number enables the implementation of ionic compounds as effective interface modifiers, its ubiquitous usage is limited by its low&#8208;oxidation durability and high&#8208;volatility. Regulation of the solvation structure and construction of well&#8208;structured interfacial layers ensure the potential strength of electrolytes in both Li&#8208;metal and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). This study reports the build&#8208;up of multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by utilizing different electron&#8208;accepting tendencies of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBP), lithium nitrate, and synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine. Furthermore, a well&#8208;structured cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface from LiDFBP effectively addresses the issues with NCM811. The developed electrolyte based on a framework of highly&#8208; and weakly&#8208;solvating solvents with interface modifiers enables the operation of Li|NCM811 cells with a high areal capacity cathode (4.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 4.4&#160;V versus Li/Li+.

         <title>Femtosecond Electron Diffraction Reveals Local Disorder and Local Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and TDDFT&#8208;MD simulations, the local disorder and local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively, indicating a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel. The use of femtosecond electron diffraction is demonstrated to detect nonequilibrium structural dynamics in crystalline&#8208;disordered materials and reveal the intrinsic local disorder and local anharmonicity with femtosecond&#8208;picometer temporospatial resolution.








Abstract
In addition to long&#8208;range periodicity, local disorder, with local structures deviating from the average lattice structure, dominates the physical properties of phonons, electrons, and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials. Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such a local disorder and correlating it with advanced functions remains challenging. Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, the static local disorder and its local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively. The ultrafast structural dynamics reveal that the crystalline SnSe is composed of multiple locally correlated configurations dominated by the static off&#8208;symmetry displacements of Sn (&#8776;0.4 &#197;) and such a set of locally correlated structures is termed local disorder. Moreover, the anharmonicity of this local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs, indicating the signature of probable THz Einstein oscillators. The identified local disorder and local anharmonicity suggest a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel, which updates the fundamental insight into the long&#8208;debated ultralow thermal conductivity of SnSe. The method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the locally correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad interest in the construction of structure&#8211;property relationships in material science.

         <title>Viscoelasticity&#8208;Controlled Relaxation in Wrinkling Surface for Multistage Time&#8208;Resolved Optical Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; wrinkling system with controllable polymer interaction networks. By regulating the viscoelasticity of polymer interaction networks, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. Consequently, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved, which can be further utilized to develop a practical encryption label.








Abstract
As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity&#8208;controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time&#8208;resolved encryption materials in utilization potential. Besides, the dynamic hydrogen bond networks are extended to various dynamic interaction networks, demonstrating the versatility of the dynamic encryption strategy. This work not only provides an additional dimension for dynamic information encryption in daily practical use, but also offers theoretical guidance for the development of advanced optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and smart display materials in the future.

         <title>Platinum Nanoparticles Regulated V2C MXene Nanoplatforms with NIR&#8208;II Enhanced Nanozyme Effect for Photothermal and Chemodynamic Anti&#8208;infective Therapy</title>

Abstract
Given the challenge of multidrug resistance in antibiotics, non&#8208;antibiotic&#8208;dependent antibacterial strategies show promise for anti&#8208;infective therapy. V2C MXene&#8208;based nanomaterials have demonstrated strong biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) for photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the limitation of V2C MXene's laser irradiation to the near&#8208;infrared region I (NIR&#8208;I) restricts tissue penetration, making it difficult to achieve complete bacterial eradication with single&#8208;effect therapeutic strategies. To address this, Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) were attached to V2C, forming artificial nanoplatforms (Pt@V2C). Pt@V2C exhibited enhanced PCE (59.6%) and a longer irradiation laser (NIR&#8208;II) due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of Pt NPs and V2C. Notably, Pt@V2C displayed dual enzyme&#8208;like activity with chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and NIR&#8208;II enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;like activity. The biocatalytic mechanism of Pt@V2C was elucidated using density functional theory. In an in vivo animal model, Pt@V2C effectively eliminated methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus from deep&#8208;seated tissues in subcutaneous abscesses and bacterial keratitis environments, accelerating abscess resolution and promoting wound and cornea healing through the synergistic effects of PTT/CDT. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pt@V2C targeted inflammatory pathways, providing insight into its therapeutic mechanism. This study presents a promising therapeutic approach involving hyperthermia&#8208;amplified biocatalysis with Pt NPs and MXene nanocomposites.

         <title>Visualizing Nanoscale Interlayer Magnetic Interactions and Unconventional Low&#8208;Frequency Behaviors in Ferromagnetic Multi&#8208;shelled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Precise manipulation of van der Waals forces within two&#8208;dimensional atomic layers allows for exact control over electron&#8208;phonon coupling, leading to the exceptional quantum properties. However, applying this technique to diverse structures such as three&#8208;dimensional materials is challenging. Therefore, investigating new hierarchical structures and different interlayer forces is crucial for overcoming these limitations and discovering novel physical properties. In this work, a multi&#8208;shelled ferromagnetic material with controllable shell numbers is developed. By strategically regulating the magnetic interactions between these shells, the magnetic properties of each shell are fine&#8208;tuned. This approach reveals distinctive magnetic characteristics including regulated magnetic domain configurations and enhanced effective fields. The nanoscale magnetic interactions between the shells were observed and analyzed, which shed light on the modified magnetic properties of each shell, enhancing the understanding and control of ferromagnetic materials. The distinctive magnetic interaction significantly boosts electromagnetic absorption at low&#8208;frequency frequencies used by fifth&#8208;generation (5G) wireless devices, outperforming ferromagnetic materials without multilayer structures by several folds. The application of magnetic interactions in materials science reveals thrilling prospects for technological and electronic innovation.

         <title>Dendritic Polymer&#8208;Based Nanomedicines Remodel the Tumor Stroma: Improve Drug Penetration and Enhance Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in solid tumors, contributed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), hinders penetration of drugs and diminishes their therapeutic outcomes. We proposed a sequential treatment strategy of remodeling the ECM via a CAF modifier (dasatinib, DAS) to promote penetration of an immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (epirubicin, Epi) via apoptotic vesicles, ultimately enhancing the treatment efficacy against breast cancer. We developed dendritic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA)&#8208;based nanomedicines (P&#8208;DAS and P&#8208;Epi) for sequential delivery of DAS and Epi, respectively. P&#8208;DAS reprograms CAFs to reduce collagen by downregulating collagen anabolism and energy metabolism, thereby reducing the ECM deposition. The regulated ECM could enhance tumor penetration of P&#8208;Epi to strengthen its ICD effect, leading to an amplified anti&#8208;tumor immune response. In breast cancer&#8208;bearing mice, this approach alleviates the ECM barrier, resulting in reduced tumor burden and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and more encouragingly, synergizes effectively with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and preventing lung metastasis. Furthermore, systemic toxicity is barely detectable after sequential treatment with P&#8208;DAS and P&#8208;Epi. This approach opens a new avenue for treating desmoplastic tumors by metabolically targeting CAFs to overcome the ECM barrier.

         <title>Engineering Anomalously Large Electron Transport in Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anomalous transport of topological semimetals has generated significant interest for applications in optoelectronics, nanoscale devices, and interconnects. Understanding the origin of novel transport is crucial to engineering the desired material properties, yet their orders of magnitude higher transport than single&#8208;particle mobilities remain unexplained. This work demonstrates the dramatic mobility enhancements result from phonons primarily returning momentum to electrons due to phonon&#8208;electron dominating over phonon&#8208;phonon scattering. Proving this idea, proposed by Peierls in 1932, requires tuning electron and phonon dispersions without changing symmetry, topology, or disorder. This is achieved by combining de Haas &#8208; van Alphen (dHvA), electron transport, Raman scattering, and first&#8208;principles calculations in the topological semimetals MX2 (M = Nb, Ta and X = Ge, Si). Replacing Ge with Si brings the transport mobilities from an order magnitude larger than single particle ones to nearly balanced. This occurs without changing the crystal structure or topology and with small differences in disorder or Fermi surface. Simultaneously, Raman scattering and first&#8208;principles calculations establish phonon&#8208;electron dominated scattering only in the MGe2 compounds. Thus, this study proves that phonon&#8208;drag is crucial to the transport properties of topological semimetals and provides insight to engineer these materials&#160;further.

However, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by digital systems poses a significant threat to our society, potentially leading to a future crisis. While numerous efforts have been made to develop nanotechnological shielding systems to mitigate the detrimental effects of EMI, there has been limited focus on creating absorption&#8208;dominant shielding solutions. Achieving absorption&#8208;dominant EMI shields requires careful structural design engineering, starting from the smallest components and considering the most effective electromagnetic wave (EMW) attenuating factors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of shielding structures, emphasizing the critical elements of absorption&#8208;dominant shielding design, shielding mechanisms, limitations of both traditional and nanotechnological EMI shields, and common misconceptions about the foundational principles of EMI shielding science. This systematic review serves as a scientific guide for designing shielding structures that prioritize absorption, highlighting an often&#8208;overlooked aspect of shielding science.

         <title>Electrically Controlled All&#8208;antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions on Silicon with Large Room&#8208;temperature Magnetoresistance</title>

Abstract
Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are a pathway to spintronic memory and computing devices with unprecedented speed, energy efficiency, and bit density. Realizing this potential requires AFM devices with simultaneous electrical writing and reading of information, which are also compatible with established silicon&#8208;based manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) readout in epitaxial AFM tunnel junctions. However, these TMR structures were not grown using a silicon&#8208;compatible deposition process, and controlling their AFM order required external magnetic fields. Here we show three&#8208;terminal AFM tunnel junctions based on the noncollinear antiferromagnet PtMn3, sputter&#8208;deposited on silicon. The devices simultaneously exhibit electrical switching using electric currents, and electrical readout by a large room&#8208;temperature TMR effect. First&#8208;principles calculations explain the TMR in terms of the momentum&#8208;resolved spin&#8208;dependent tunneling conduction in tunnel junctions with noncollinear AFM electrodes.

         <title>Sequential Dual Alignments Introduce Synergistic Effect on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Platelets for Superior Thermal Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Planarly aligning two&#8208;dimensional (2D) platelets is challenging due to their additional orientational freedom compared to one&#8208;dimensional materials. This study reports a sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach, employing an extrusion printing&#8208;induced shear force and rotating magnetic field&#8208;induced force couple for platelet planarly alignment in a yield&#8208;stress support bath. It is hypothesized that the partial alignment induced by a directional shear force facilitates subsequent axial rotation of the platelets for planar alignment under an external force couple, resulting in a synergistic alignment effect. This sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach achieves better planar alignment of 2D modified hexagonal boron nitride (mhBN). Specifically, the thermal conductivity of the 40 wt% mhBN/epoxy composite is significantly higher (692%) than that of unaligned composites, surpassing the cumulative effect of individual methods (only 133%) with a five&#8208;time more synergistic effect. For 30, 40, and 50 wt% mhBN composites, the thermal conductivity values (5.9, 9.5, and 13.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) show considerable improvement compared to the previously reported highest values (5.3, 6.6, and 8.6&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Additionally, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mhBN/epoxy heat sink is printed and evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of device fabrication. The approach will enable the planar alignment of electrically or thermally conducting 2D fillers during 3D fabrication.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells: Defect Regulation and Emerging Applications in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as CsPbX3, have garnered considerable attention recently, as they exhibit superior thermodynamic and optoelectronic stabilities compared to the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PSCs. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbX3 PSCs is generally lower than that of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PSCs, as they contain higher defect densities at the interface and within the perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layers, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss. Consequently, defect regulation has been adopted as an important strategy to improve device performance and stability. This review aims to comprehensively summarize recent progresses on the defect regulation in CsPbX3 PSCs, as well as their cutting&#8208;edge applications in extreme scenarios. We first discuss the underlying fundamental mechanisms leading to the defect formation in the crystal structure of CsPbX3 PSCs, and provide an overview of literature&#8208;adopted defect regulation strategies in the context of interface, internal, and surface engineering. Cutting&#8208;edge applications of CsPbX3 PSCs in extreme environments such as outer space and underwater situations are highlighted. Finally, a summary and outlook are presented on future directions for achieving higher efficiencies and superior stability in CsPbX3 PSCs.

         <title>Binary Solvent Induced Stable Interphase Layer for Ultra&#8208;Long Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium foil, promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, faces reversibility challenges due to its inherent reactivity and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. In this study, we achieve a stable sodium metal battery by tuning the electrolyte solvation structure through the addition of co&#8208;solvent 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) to diglyme (Dig). The introduction of cyclic ether&#8208;based MTHF results in increased anion incorporation in the solvation structure, even at lower salt concentrations. Specifically, the anion stabilization capabilities of the environmentally sustainable MTHF co&#8208;solvent lead to a contact&#8208;ion pair&#8208;based solvation structure. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy analysis reveals that a shift toward an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure promotes the formation of a thin and uniform SEI layer. Consequently, employing a NaPF6&#8208;based electrolyte with a Dig:MTHF ratio of 50% (v/v) binary solvent yields an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.72% for 300 cycles in Cu||Na cell cycling. Remarkably, at a C/2 cycling rate, Na||Na symmetric cell cycling demonstrates ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability exceeding 7000 hours, and full cells with Na0.44MnO2 as a cathode retain 80% of their capacity after 500 cycles. This study systematically examines solvation structure, SEI layer composition, and electrochemical cycling, emphasizing the significance of MTHF&#8208;based binary solvent mixtures for high&#8208;performance sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Freezing Shrinkage Dynamics and Surface Dendritic Growth of Floating Refractory Alloy Droplets in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The freezing shrinkage and dendritic growth are of great importance for various alloys solidified from high temperature liquids to solids since they dominate microstructure patterns and follow&#8208;up processing. However, the microgravity freezing shrinkage dynamics is scarcely explored on the ground as it is hard to suppress the strong natural convection inside liquid alloys. Here, we conduct a series of in&#8208;orbit solidification experiments aboard China Space Station with a long&#8208;term stable 10&#8722;5 g0 microgravity condition. A highest temperature up to 2265 K together with substantial liquid undercoolings far from thermodynamically stable state are attained for both Nb82.7Si17.3 and Zr64V36 refractory alloys. Furthermore, we simulate the freezing shrinkage of a droplet without gravity to reveal the liquid&#8208;solid interface migration, temperature gradient, and flow field. It is found that microgravity solidification process leads to freezing shrinkage cavities and distinctive surface dendritic microstructure patterns. The combined effects of shrinkage dynamics and liquid surface flow in outer space result in the dendrites growing not only along the tangential direction but also along the normal direction to the droplet surface. These space experimental results contribute to a further understanding of solidification behavior of liquid alloys under a weaker convection condition, which is often masked by gravity on the ground.

         <title>Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging with ROS&#8208;Responsive Bilirubin Nanoparticles Enables Monitoring of Non&#8208;Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Progression to Cirrhosis</title>

Abstract
Despite the vital importance of monitoring the progression of non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non&#8208;alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we currently lack an efficient imaging modality that is readily available at hospitals. In this study, we present a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;based imaging modality that allows for efficient and longitudinal monitoring of NAFLD and NASH progression. Our imaging modality uses manganese ion (Mn2+)&#8208;chelated bilirubin nanoparticles (Mn@BRNPs) as a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive MRI imaging probe. We performed longitudinal T1&#8208;weighted MR imaging of NASH model mice after injecting Mn@BRNPs intravenously. The MR signal enhancement in the liver relative to muscle gradually increased up to 8 weeks of NASH progression, but decreased significantly as NASH progressed to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage at weeks 10 and 12. We developed a new dual input pseudo three&#8208;compartment model to provide information on NASH stage with a single MRI scan. We also demonstrated that our ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs can be used to monitor the efficacy of potential anti&#8208;NASH drugs with conventional MRI. Our findings suggest that our ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs have the potential to serve as an efficient MRI contrast for monitoring NASH progression and its transition to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Microsensors Inspired by Noctiluca Scintillans for Small&#8208;Defect Positioning and Electrical&#8208;Stress Visualization in Polymers</title>

Abstract
small defects induce concentrated electrical stress in dielectric polymers, leading to premature failure of materials. Existing sensing methods fail to effectively visualize these defects owing to the invisible&#8208;energy state of the electric field. Thus, it is necessary to establish a nondestructive method for the real&#8208;time detection of small defects in dielectric polymers. In this study, a self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by Noctiluca scintillans is designed to endow materials with the ability of self&#8208;detection for defects and electrical stress. The SRM leverages the energy of a nearby electric field to emit measurable fluorescence, enabling defect localization and diagnosis as well as electrical&#8208;stress visualization. A controllable dielectric microsphere is constructed to achieve an adjustable electroluminescence threshold for the SRM, thereby increasing its detection accuracy while decreasing the electroluminescence threshold. The potential degradation in the polymer performance owing to SRM implantation is addressed by assembling long molecular chains on the SRM surface to spontaneously generate an interpenetrating network. Results of finite element analyses and experiments demonstrate that the SRM can effectively realize nondestructive visualization and positioning of small defects and concentrated electrical stress in polymers, positioning it as a promising sensing method for monitoring the electric field and charge distribution in materials.

Catalyst/photocatalyst&#8211;aptamer hybrid conjugates provide effective model systems for native enzymes or photosystems. Aptamers conjugated to homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts, or photosensitizers yield &#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221;, &#8220;aptananozymes&#8221;, or &#8220;photoaptazymes&#8221;, emulating native enzymes and photosystems. Structure&#8211;function relationships in the hybrid systems are observed and diverse applications of the systems are addressed.








Abstract
Conjugation of aptamers to homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221;), heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts (&#8220;aptananozymes&#8221;), and photocatalysts (&#8220;photoaptazymes&#8221;) yields superior catalytic/photocatalytic hybrid nanostructures emulating functions of native enzymes and photosystems. The concentration of the substrate in proximity to the catalytic sites (&#8220;molarity effect&#8221;) or spatial concentration of electron&#8208;acceptor units in spatial proximity to the photosensitizers, by aptamer&#8211;ligand complexes, leads to enhanced catalytic/photocatalytic efficacies of the hybrid nanostructures. This is exemplified by sets of &#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221; composed of aptamers conjugated to the hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzymes or metal&#8211;ligand complexes as catalysts, catalyzing the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, oxygen&#8208;insertion into the Ar&#9472;H moiety of tyrosinamide and the subsequent oxidation of the catechol product into aminochrome, or the hydrolysis of esters or ATP. Also, aptananozymes consisting of aptamers conjugated to Cu2+&#8208; or Ce4+&#8208;ion&#8208;modified C&#8208;dots or polyadenine&#8208;stabilized Au nanoparticles acting as catalysts oxidizing&#160;dopamine or operating bioreactor biocatalytic cascades, are demonstrated. In addition, aptamers conjugated to the Ru(II)&#8211;tris&#8208;bipyridine photosensitizer or the Zn(II) protoporphyrin IX photosensitizer provide supramolecular photoaptazyme assemblies emulating native photosynthetic reaction centers. Effective photoinduced electron transfer followed by the catalyzed synthesis of NADPH or the evolution of H2 is demonstrated by the photosystems. Structure&#8211;function relationships dictate the catalytic and photocatalytic efficacies of the systems.

         <title>Nanozymes: Definition, Activity, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a historical perspective, the definition, catalytic activity, and mechanism of nanozymes are compared with enzymes. Immobilized catalysts and catalytic nanomaterials are two types of nanozymes, and the field has benefited from the name of nanozyme to endeavor replacement of enzymes with catalytic nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozyme&#8221; is used to describe various catalysts from immobilized inorganic metal complexes, immobilized enzymes to inorganic nanoparticles. Here, the history of nanozymes is dvescribed in detail, and they can be largely separated into two types. Type 1 nanozymes refer to immobilized catalysts or enzymes on nanomaterials, which&#160;were&#160;dominant in the first decade since 2004. Type 2 nanozymes, which rely on the surface catalytic properties of inorganic nanomaterials, are the dominating type in the past decade. The definition of nanozymes is evolving, and a definition based on the same substrates and products as enzymes are able to cover most currently claimed nanozymes, although they may have different mechanisms compared to their enzyme counterparts. A broader definition can inspire application&#8208;based research to replace enzymes with nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications. Comparison with enzymes also requires a clear definition of a nanozyme unit. Four ways of defining a nanozyme unit are described, with iron oxide and horseradish peroxidase activity comparison as examples in each definition. Growing work is devoted to understanding the&#160;catalytic mechanism of nanozymes, which provides a basis for further rational engineering of active sites. Finally, future perspective of the nanozyme field is discussed.

         <title>Approaches to Improving the Selectivity of Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes must be selective if they are to replace enzymes in sensing or catalysis. Mimicking enzymatic active sites and nanoconfined substrate channels provides an avenue to improving the selectivity of nanozymes. However, a purely biomimetic approach to nanozyme design limits the design of enzyme mimics. Therefore, designers endeavor to utilize all synthetic methods to make more selective nanozymes.








Abstract
Nanozymes mimic enzymes and that includes their selectivity. To achieve selectivity, significant inspiration for nanoparticle design can come from the geometric and molecular features that make enzymes selective catalysts. The two central features enzymes use are control over the arrangement of atoms in the active site and the placing of the active site down a nanoconfined substrate channel. The implementation of enzyme&#8208;inspired features has already been shown to both improve activity and selectivity of nanoparticles for a variety of catalytic and sensing applications. The tuning and control of active sites on metal nanoparticle surfaces ranges from simply changing the composition of the surface metal to sophisticated approaches such as the immobilization of single atoms on a metal substrate. Molecular frameworks provide a powerful platform for the implementation of isolated and discrete active sites while unique diffusional environments further improve selectivity. The implementation of nanoconfined substrate channels around these highly controlled active sites offers further ability to control selectivity through altering the solution environment and transport of reactants and products. Implementing these strategies together offers a unique opportunity to improve nanozyme selectivity in both sensing and catalysis.

         <title>The Nanozyme Revolution: Enhancing the Performance of Medical Biosensing Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances and current challenges of enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles and their use in biosensing are highlighted, with a special focus on point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices and their translational path for use in biomedical devices. These materials exhibit innate advantages compared to biological enzymes and nanoparticle probes currently utilized and hold great promise for implementation in biotechnology and clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
Nanozymes represent a class of nanosized materials that exhibit innate catalytic properties similar to biological enzymes. The unique features of&#160;these materials have positioned them as promising candidates for applications in clinical sensing devices, specifically those&#160;employed at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. They notably have found use as a means to amplify signals in nanosensor&#8208;based platforms and thereby improve sensor detection limits. Recent developments in the understanding of the fundamental chemistries underpinning these materials have enabled the development of highly effective nanozymes capable of sensing clinically relevant biomarkers at detection limits that compete with &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; techniques. However, there remain considerable hurdles that need to be overcome before these nanozyme&#8208;based sensors can be utilized in a platform ready for clinical use. An overview of the current understandings of nanozymes for disease diagnostics and biosensing applications and the unmet challenges that must be considered prior to their translation in clinical diagnostic tests is provided.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide to Polysulfide and Thiosulfate by a Carbon Nanozyme: Therapeutic Implications with an Emphasis on Down Syndrome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized carbon nanozymes catalytically oxidize hydrogen sulfide to polysulfides and thiosulfate in an oxygen&#8208;dependent manner. In this report the reaction kinetics of polysulfide and thiosulfate formation both in a cell&#8208;free setting and intracellularly and present the possible role of these nanozymes as a supportive therapy in Down Syndrome, a condition where hydrogen sulfide production is detrimentally elevated.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a noxious, potentially poisonous, but necessary gas produced from sulfur metabolism in humans. In Down Syndrome (DS), the production of H2S is elevated and associated with degraded mitochondrial function. Therefore, removing H2S from the body as a stable oxide could be an approach to reducing the deleterious effects of H2S in DS. In this report we describe the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to polysulfides (HS2+n&#8722;) and thiosulfate (S2O32&#8722;) by poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) and poly(ethylene glycol) oxidized activated charcoal (PEG&#8208;OACs), examples of oxidized carbon nanozymes (OCNs). We show that OCNs oxidize H2S to polysulfides and S2O32&#8722; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on O2 and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H2S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H2S exemplified by DS.

         <title>The Interaction of Amines with Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you wanted to know about the amine gold nanoparticle interaction and never dared to ask: mode and strength of binding, kinetics of the exchange of the amines, redox processes occurring at the surface and hints for preparation of robust semisynthetic nanozymes.








Abstract
Understanding the interactions between amines and the surface of gold nanoparticles is important because of their role in the stabilization of the nanosystems, in the formation of the protein corona, and in the preparation of semisynthetic nanozymes. By using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and molecular simulation,&#160;a detailed picture of these interactions is obtained. Herein, it is shown that amines interact with surface Au(0) atoms of the nanoparticles with their lone electron pair with a strength linearly correlating with their basicity corrected for steric hindrance. The kinetics of binding depends on the position of the gold atoms (flat surfaces or edges) while the mode of binding involves a single Au(0) with nitrogen sitting on top of it. A small fraction of surface Au(I) atoms, still present, is reduced by the amines yielding a much stronger Au(0)&#8211;RN.+ (RN., after the loss of a proton) interaction. In this case, the mode of binding involves two Au(0) atoms with a bridging nitrogen placed between them. Stable Au nanoparticles, as those required for robust semisynthetic nanozymes preparation, are better obtained when the protein is involved (at least in part) in the reduction of the gold ions.

         <title>Fibrous Zr&#8208;MOF Nanozyme Aerogels with Macro&#8208;Nanoporous Structure for Enhanced Catalytic Hydrolysis of Organophosphate Toxins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable macro&#8208;micro porous aerogel composites with high metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loadings. The hierarchically structured MOF nanozymes monolithic aerogel enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites for fast and efficient hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with Lewis acid catalytic sites, such as zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs), comprise a growing class of phosphatase&#8208;like nanozymes that can degrade toxic organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. Rationally engineering and shaping MOFs from as&#8208;synthesized powders into hierarchically porous monoliths is essential for their use in emerging applications, such as filters for air and water purification and personal protection gear. However, several challenges still limit the production of practical MOF composites, including the need for sophisticated reaction conditions, low MOF catalyst loadings in the resulting composites, and poor accessibility to MOF&#8208;based active sites. To overcome these limitations, a rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable monolithic aerogel composites with high MOF loadings. These composites contain Zr&#8208;MOF nanozymes embedded in the structure, and hierarchical macro&#8208;micro porosity enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites. This multifaceted rational design strategy, including the selection of a MOF with many catalytic sites, fine&#8208;tuning the coating morphology, and the fabrication of a hierarchically structured monolithic aerogel, renders synergistic effects toward the efficient continuous hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.

         <title>A Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme&#160;for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of defect engineering, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme is developed for combinational second near&#8208;infrared photothermal immunotherapy of cancer. This controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. Herein, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) is reported for combinational second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>A Manganese&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme of manganese&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and developed by mimicking the structural features of the natural counterparts. It exhibits extremely stable oxidase&#8208;like activity at both psychrophilic and mesophilic condition (0&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, a low&#8208;temperature antivirus strategy is innovatively established based on nMnBTC to inactive influenza virus H1N1 with high efficiency at &#8722;20 &#176;C.








Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on a manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and synthesized. The nMnBTC as an oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#160;&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#160;&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high&#8208;catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity, and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom Fe nanowires are designed to mimic peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The mechanism of phosphorus modulation via long&#8208;range interaction for increasing catalytic activity is fully analyzed. The designed single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits good sensitivity in an enzyme&#8208;cascade sensor platform for colorimetric acetylcholine sensing. This work provides a strategy for creating enzyme&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts and replacing natural enzymes in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the structure of natural peroxidase's active center. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SAC POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, a phosphorus (P) heteroatom is introduced to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs. A 1D&#160;carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8211;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and P atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the P&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one, with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can greatly enhance POD&#8208;like activity initially, but its effect becomes insignificant with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme integrating thrombolytic and reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities is developed for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the nanozyme binds fibrin in the thrombus, crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulates in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolongs the blood&#8208;circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide-templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self-assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide-templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched-on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prolongs the blood-circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide-templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half-life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembled Nanozyme for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by the antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, this work reports a biomimetic NiCo2O4 nanozyme with 3&#8208;level hierarchical architecture that can self&#8208;adaptively tune their hierarchical nanostructures to capture bacteria of various morphotypes. The intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanozyme promotes the generation of highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis.








Abstract
Along with the rapid development and ever&#8208;deepening understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology, nanomaterials hold promise to mimic the highly evolved biological exquisite nanostructures and sophisticated functions. Here, inspired by the ubiquitous antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, a NiCo2O4 nanozyme with self&#8208;adaptive hierarchical nanostructure is developed that can capture bacteria of various morphotypes via the physico&#8208;mechanical interaction between the nanostructure and bacteria. Moreover, the developed biomimetic nanostructure further exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which can catalytically generate highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis. Therefore, the mechano&#8208;catalytic coupling property of this NiCo2O4 nanozyme allows for an extensive and efficient antibacterial application, with no concerns of antimicrobial resistance. This work suggests a promising strategy for the rational design of advanced antibacterial materials by mimicking biological antibiosis.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes synthesized via the oxidation of coconut&#8208;derived activated charcoal afford markable protection against oxidative injury in an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury. By tuning the oxidation process, smaller, more homogeneous nanomaterials containing free&#8208;radical&#8208;quenching quinone active sites are targeted for enhanced bioactivity. Such findings highlight the features that drive the oxidative power of these nanozymes.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme&#8208;microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.








Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification can engineer charge transfer between Ru and ligands and facilitate intermediate radicals to react with colorimetric substrate, which significantly improves the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Ru nanozymes superior to horseradish peroxidase. Following such a mechanism, polystyrene&#8208;sulfonate&#8208;modified Ru nanozymes can be used as an enzyme alternative in enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay to improve detection sensitivity up to 140&#8208;fold, validated with human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein.








Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS&#8208;modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (1305&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;peroxidase&#160;nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzymes.

Bioinspired Artificial Nanozymes
Bioinspired by the antibacterial nanostructures on the wing surfaces of some insects, this work reports a biomimetic NiCo2O4 nanozyme with 3&#8208;level hierarchical architecture that can self&#8208;adaptively tune their hierarchical nanostructures to capture bacteria of various morphotypes. The intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the proposed nanozyme promotes the generation of highly reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis. More details can be found in article number 2210455 by Changbin Zhang, Minmin Liang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Based Therapeutic Antioxidants for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With their exceptional nature to quench reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, ceria nanoparticles have been investigated as therapeutic nanozymes to treat diseases in which the oxidative stress aggravates the pathological condition. This review introduces the mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of ceria nanoparticles and the exemplary studies that take advantage of it. Remaining challenges and future perspectives are also provided.








Abstract
The growing interest in nanomedicine over the last 20 years has carved out a research field called &#8220;nanocatalytic therapy,&#8221; where catalytic reactions mediated by nanomaterials are employed to intervene in disease&#8208;critical biomolecular processes. Among many kinds of catalytic/enzyme&#8208;mimetic nanomaterials investigated thus far, ceria nanoparticles stand out from others owing to their unique scavenging properties against biologically noxious free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), by exerting enzyme mimicry and nonenzymatic activities. Much&#160;effort has been made to utilize ceria nanoparticles as self&#8208;regenerating antioxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents for various kinds of diseases, given the detrimental effects of ROS and RNS therein that need alleviation. In this context, this review is intended to provide an overview as to what makes ceria nanoparticles merit attention in disease therapy. The introductory part describes the characteristics of ceria nanoparticles as an oxygen&#8208;deficient metal oxide. The pathophysiological roles of ROS and RNS are then presented, as well as their scavenging mechanisms by ceria nanoparticles. Representative examples of recent ceria&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics are summarized by categorization into organ and disease types, followed by the discussion on the remaining challenges and future research directions.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Nanozyme Design: Lessons from Materials and Engineered Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials. However, the design of new nanozymes remains challenging. Here, recent advancements in ML&#8208;assisted discovery and design of materials and engineered enzymes is summarized, along with a discussion as to how these successful cases can be implicated in addressing the current problems facing the nanozyme field. The prospective design of nanozymes based on ML technology is also proposed.








Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes, by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, as well as their biomedical applications, are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past have been obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficacy, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics of Nanozymes: Insights from Theory and Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A historic overview of how theory and computation promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities of nanomaterials is provided. It is expected to spark future ideas for screening or designing more stable and efficient enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials with fascinating application potential prior to experiments.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozymes&#8221; usually refers to inorganic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. The research into nanozymes is one of the hot topics on the horizon of interdisciplinary science involving materials, chemistry, and biology. Although great progress has been made in the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of nanozymes, the study of the underlying microscopic mechanisms and kinetics is still not straightforward. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations compute the potential energy surfaces along the reaction coordinates for chemical reactions, which can give atomistic&#8208;level insights into the micro&#8208;mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes. Therefore, DFT calculations have been playing an increasingly important role in exploring the mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes in the past years. The calculations either predict the microscopic details for the catalytic processes to complement the experiments or further develop theoretical models to depict the physicochemical rules. In this review, the corresponding research progress is summarized. Particularly, the review focuses on the computational studies that closely interplay with the experiments. The relevant experimental results without DFT calculations will be also briefly discussed to offer a historic overview of how the computations promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of nanozymes.

Multienzymic nanozymes are nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity. Multienzymic nanozymes have unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and responsive selectivity. The catalytic mechanism of multienzymic nanozymes is more complicated and elusive than single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the classification, regulating factors, rational design, and application of multienzymic nanozymes are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multienzymic nanozymes, and they&#160;have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multienzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multienzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the multienzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multienzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multicatalytic activities are systematically discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multienzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multienzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of Biologically Active Reducible Oxide Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducible metal oxide nanoparticles are increasingly being studied for biomedical and therapeutic applications. These materials are able to accomplish a broad range of catalytic surface reactions, as well as being amenable to designed enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities as nanozymes. Here, physicochemical properties and material compositions informing optimal nanozyme activities by reducible metal oxide nanomaterials are considered.








Abstract
Reducible metal oxide nanozymes (rNZs) are a subject of intense recent interest due to their catalytic nature, ease of synthesis, and complex surface character. Such materials contain surface sites which facilitate enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions via substrate coordination and redox cycling. Further, these surface reactive sites are shown to be highly sensitive to stresses within the nanomaterial lattice, the physicochemical environment, and to processing conditions occurring as part of their syntheses. When administered in vivo, a complex protein corona binds to the surface, redefining its biological identity and subsequent interactions within the biological system. Catalytic activities of rNZs each deliver a differing impact on protein corona formation, its composition, and in turn, their recognition, and internalization by host cells. Improving the understanding of the precise principles that dominate rNZ surface&#8208;biomolecule adsorption raises the question of whether designer rNZs can be engineered to prevent corona formation, or indeed to produce &#8220;custom&#8221; protein coronas applied either in vitro, and preadministration, or formed immediately upon their exposure to body fluids. Here, fundamental surface chemistry processes and their implications in rNZ material performance are considered. In particular, material structures which inform component adsorption from the application environment, including substrates for enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions are discussed.

         <title>Current Advances on the Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme and Its Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis approaches including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down strategies; catalysis modulation including central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8208;support interaction for activity and selectivity modulation of single&#8208;atom nanozymes; and bioapplications in the biosensing, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor fields are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes, a class of nanomaterials mimicking the function of enzymes, have aroused much attention as the candidate in diverse fields with the arbitrarily tunable features owing to the diversity of crystalline nanostructures, composition, and surface configurations. However, the uncertainty of their active sites and the lower intrinsic deficiencies of nanomaterial&#8208;initiated catalysis compared with the natural enzymes promote the pursuing of alternatives by imitating the biological active centers. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) maximize the atom utilization with the well&#8208;defined structure, providing an important bridge to investigate mechanism and the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. They have risen as the new burgeoning alternative to the natural enzyme from in vitro bioanalytical tool to in vivo therapy owing to the flexible atomic engineering structure. Here, focus is mainly on the three parts. First, a detailed overview of single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis strategies including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches is given. Then, according to the structural feature of single&#8208;atom nanocatalysts, the influence factors such as central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8211;support interaction are discussed and the representative biological applications (including antibacterial/antiviral performance, cancer therapy, and biosensing) are highlighted. In the end, the future perspective and challenge facing are demonstrated.

         <title>Modular Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal nanozymes facilitate in situ drug synthesis at disease sites through prodrug activation. This review investigates the role of nanomaterials in stabilizing and regulating transition metal catalysts (TMCs), emphasizing the modular design of nanomaterials and catalysts. It explores their synergistic engineering for efficient in situ uncaging of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.








Abstract
The incorporation of transition metal catalysts (TMCs) into nanoscaffolds generates nanocatalysts that replicate key aspects of enzymatic behavior. The TMCs can access bioorthogonal chemistry unavailable to living systems. These bioorthogonal nanozymes can be employed as in situ &#8220;factories&#8221; for generating bioactive molecules where needed. The generation of effective bioorthogonal nanozymes requires co&#8208;engineering of the TMC and the nanometric scaffold. This review presents an overview of recent advances in the field of bioorthogonal nanozymes, focusing on modular design aspects of both nanomaterial and catalyst and how they synergistically work together for in situ uncaging of imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Regulation of Cellular Metabolism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of nanozymes in the metabolic regulation of diverse cells, including mammalian cells, microbial cells, and plant cells is reviewed, and the applications of nanozyme&#8208;based metabolic regulation in disease treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture are highlighted. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future research are discussed.








Abstract
Metabolism is the sum of the enzyme&#8208;dependent chemical reactions, which produces energy in catabolic process and synthesizes biomass in anabolic process, exhibiting high similarity in mammalian cell, microbial cell, and plant cell. Consequently, the loss or gain of metabolic enzyme activity greatly affects cellular metabolism. Nanozymes, as emerging enzyme mimics with diverse functions and adjustable catalytic activities, have shown attractive potential for metabolic regulation. Although the basic metabolic tasks are highly similar for the cells from different species, the concrete metabolic pathway varies with the intracellular structure of different species. Here, the basic metabolism in living organisms is described and the similarities and differences in the metabolic pathways among mammalian, microbial, and plant cells and the regulation mechanism are discussed. The recent progress on regulation of cellular metabolism mainly including nutrient uptake and utilization, energy production, and the accompanied redox reactions by different kinds of oxidoreductases and their applications in the field of disease therapy, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture is systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of nanozymes in regulating cell metabolism are also discussed, which broaden their application scenarios.

         <title>A Perspective on Uniform Plating Behavior of Mg Metal Anode: Diffusion Limited Theory versus Nucleation Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective points out the &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; between &#8220;Kinetic&#8208;Control Region&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;, where the current density exceeds limited value, but time has not yet reached the Sand's time. In this buffer zone, dense and uniform Mg deposit layer is available, even the optimal deposit occurs in the vicinity of the boundary between &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;.








Abstract
Utilizing metal anode is the most attractive way to meet the urgent demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Unfortunately, the formation of dendrites, which is caused by uneven plating behavior, always threaten the safety of the batteries. To explore the origin of different plating behavior and predict the plating morphology of anode under a variety of operating conditions, multifarious models have been developed. However, abuse of models has led to conflictive views. In this perspective, to clarify the controversial reports on magnesium (Mg) metal plating behavior, the previously proposed models are elaborated that govern the plating process. Through linking various models and clarifying their boundary conditions, a scheme is drawn to illustrate the strategy for achieving the most dense and uniform plating morphology, which also explains the seemingly contradictory of diffusion limited theory and nucleation theory on uniform plating. This perspective will undoubtedly enhance the understanding on the metal anode plating process and provide meaningful guidance for the development of metal anode batteries.

         <title>Mechanical Properties of Conducting Printed Nanosheet Network Thin Films Under Uniaxial Compression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed thin film nanosheet networks show remarkable promise for a range of electrical applications. Their conductivity relies heavily on their morphology, which may be altered via compression. This work provides the first exploration of the compressive properties of printed networks of graphene and MoS2 to explore properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure, and sheet bending versus slippage.








Abstract
Thin film networks of solution processed nanosheets show remarkable promise for use in a broad range of applications including strain sensors, energy storage, printed devices, textile electronics, and more. While it is known that their electronic properties rely heavily on their morphology, little is known of their mechanical nature, a glaring omission given the effect mechanical deformation has on the morphology of porous systems and the promise of mechanical post processing for tailored properties. Here, this work employs a recent advance in thin film mechanical testing called the Layer Compression Test to perform the first in situ analysis of printed nanosheet network compression. Due to the well&#8208;defined deformation geometry of this unique test, this work is able to explore the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic, plastic, and creep deformation in these systems, extracting properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure and sheet bending vs. slippage under both out of plane uniaxial compression and tension. This work characterizes these for a range of networks of differing porosities and sheet sizes, for low and high compression, as well as the effect of chemical cross linking. This work explores graphene and MoS2 networks, from which the results can be extended to printed nanosheet networks as a whole.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active&#8208;transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

         <title>Ultraconfined Plasmons in Atomically Thin Crystalline Silver Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline silver structures of &lt;3 nm in thickness are fabricated by lighographically prepatterning a silicon wafer and subsequently depositing a few atomic layers of metal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The method has great flexibility regarding the size and morphology of the structures, which are demonstrated to sustain plasmon resonances with quality factors as high as ten.








Abstract
The ability to confine light down to atomic scales is critical for the development of applications in optoelectronics and optical sensing as well as for the exploration of nanoscale quantum phenomena. Plasmons in metallic nanostructures with just a few atomic layers in thickness can achieve this type of confinement, although fabrication imperfections down to the subnanometer scale hinder actual developments. Here, narrow plasmons are demonstrated in atomically thin crystalline silver nanostructures fabricated by prepatterning silicon substrates and epitaxially depositing silver films of just a few atomic layers in thickness. Specifically, a silicon wafer is lithographically patterned to introduce on&#8208;demand lateral shapes, chemically process the sample to obtain an atomically flat silicon surface, and epitaxially deposit silver to obtain ultrathin crystalline metal films with the designated morphologies. Structures fabricated by following this procedure allow for an unprecedented control over optical field confinement in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, which is here illustrated by the observation of fundamental and higher&#8208;order plasmons featuring extreme spatial confinement and high&#8208;quality factors that reflect the crystallinity of the metal. The present study constitutes a&#160;substantial improvement in the degree of spatial confinement and quality factor that should facilitate the design and exploitation of atomic&#8208;scale nanoplasmonic devices for optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum&#8208;physics&#160;applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tactile sensor, which integrates biomimetic slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors in a soft medium, enables self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at the contact surface. In robotic manipulation, the sensor can achieve the self&#8208;adaptive perception of material softness and enhance tactile perception by establishing two relevant deformation attributes (material softness and compliance) for an object.








Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), increases ion migration barrier, induces (100) facet perovskite grain growth, and yields defect&#8208;reduced, homogeneous films. The blade&#8208;coated PABA&#8208;based inverted PSC achieves an impressive PCE of 23.32% and maintains 93.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 75 &#176;C and 10% relative humidity.








Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects, is reported. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintain 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1&#160;000 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanorobot&#8208;Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. The robotic system improves the targeting rate and therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor treatment with the hierarchical targeting strategy spanning targeting scale from centimeters to nanometers.








Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8211;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery is reported. For primary targeting on macroscale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on microscale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients are conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to the hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Intelligent Size&#8208;Switchable Iron Carbide&#8208;Based Nanocapsules with Cascade Delivery Capacity for Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Deep Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.








Abstract
The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

         <title>Functionalized MXene Films with Substantially Improved Low&#8208;Voltage Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA)&#8208;functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain over three times and enhances the mechanical property and stability in air. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that the co&#8208;insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA ions with Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps&#160;causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low&#8208;voltage electrochemical actuators (ECAs) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in&#8208;plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here it is demonstrated that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co&#8208;insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps that causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1&#160;V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1&#160;V and hold it firmly under 0&#160;V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high&#8208;performance actuators with other nanomaterials.

         <title>Mid&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Activatable Full Spectrum LaB6 Plasmonic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic LaB6 photocatalyst can be excited by mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light and thermal radiation from hot/warm objects to generate reactive oxygen species and exert photodegradation of organic pollutants, as well as disinfection of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public areas/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8211;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8776;1265 nm. None of the existing photocatalysts can function during nighttime in the absence of external light. Herein, an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst is reported, which can absorb UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for the decomposition of organic pollutants, as well as kill multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (&#8776;2&#8211;50 &#181;m) is readily available from the natural environments via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth including human bodies, animals, furnances,&#160;hot/warm electrical devices, and buildings.

         <title>Deformation&#8208;Induced Photoprogrammable Pattern of Polyurethane Elastomers Based on Poisson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns with high aspect ratio on polyurethane elastomers is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and the distribution of internal stress. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in stretchable strain sensors, anticounterfeiting devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Elastomers with high aspect ratio surface patterns are a promising class of materials for designing soft machines in the future. Here, a facile method for fabricating surface patterns on polyurethane elastomer by subtly utilizing the Poisson effect and gradient photocrosslinking is demonstrated. By applying uniaxial tensile strains, the aspect ratio of the surface patterns can be optionally manipulated. At prestretched state, the pattern on the polyurethane elastomer can be readily constructed through compressive stress, resulting from the gradient photocrosslinking via selective photodimerization of an anthracene&#8208;functionalized polyurethane elastomer (referred to as ANPU). The macromolecular aggregation structures during stretching deformation significantly contribute to the fabrication of high aspect ratio surface patterns. The insightful finite element analysis well demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of internal stress in the ANPU elastomer can be regulated by selectively gradient crosslinking, leading to polymer chains migrate from the exposed region to the unexposed region, thereby generating a diverse array of surface patterns. Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.

Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel naked&#8208;eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio&#8208;inspired force&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano&#8208;iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self&#8208;healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.








Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieve its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites, or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device, and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221; is developed. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulates the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel feature fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8776;100&#160;&#181;m), and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10&#8211;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing material capability of sensing patches also ensure their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allows strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which is not yet achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors toward material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction, and smart devices.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.








Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

The ambient-printed FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Generic Strategy to Stabilize Wide Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key cause of phase segregation in WBG perovskites is identified as residual PbI2 at the interface, creating electrical potential variations between domain surfaces and boundaries, inducing ion migration and subsequent phase segregation. Applying a surface reaction strategy to eliminate surface PbI2 residue enhances bandgap stability and mitigates photovoltage deficits in complete devices.








Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, the root cause of halide segregation is investigated, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to potential electrical differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide (EDAI2) at proper temperature, it is possible to effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, a notable improvement of &#8776;100&#160;mV is achieved in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8211;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, efficiency of 26.1% is demonstrated in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Diagnosing the Electrostatic Shielding Mechanism for Dendrite Suppression in Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal anode for aqueous zinc batteries is highly susceptible to dendrites and side reactions. Engineering the electrolyte with additives can combat these negative traits. Operando transmission electron microscopy is used to explore how the inclusion of LiCl additive encourages the formation of blocky Zn electroplated deposits, which it is proposed is due to an electrostatic shielding mechanism.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode; yet, they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries; yet, the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, it is shown that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. Operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block&#8208;like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Structurally&#8208;Colored Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with a Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O2 concentration in triphase interface.








Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN&#8208;based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface can promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Reconstruction of Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers for Resolving Heterogeneity of Vesicles in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a vitro system composed of synaptic vesicle&#8208;sized vesicles coupled to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) nanorulers, which enables to selectively connect isolated vesicles to generate vesicle assemblies with controlled lateral distance (from 3 to 10 nm). Moreover, this work analyzes the state heterogeneity of vesicles (individual vesicle or vesicle clusters) in cells and vesicle release heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.








Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play a pivotal role in efficient interneuronal communications in vivo. However, the coexistence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. The high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, this work uses synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers program the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 to 10 nm. This work uses the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicle assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtain a larger proportion of complex events. This work resolves the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8776;0.1 ms. This work further analyzes the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. The results indicate that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters is critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has the potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of watermelon&#8208;like ZnSnO3@UCNPs (upconversion nanoparticles) heterostructure can effectively prevent the degradation of piezoelectric ZnSnO3 quantum dots in tumor environment, fully utilizing its piezoelectric catalytic effect as an antitumor carrier. Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high-efficiency magnetic switching. Such low-symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self-switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultrasmall Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach to enhance the efficiency of photothermal conversion while maintaining the excellent intrinsic catalytic reactivity for ultrasmall Co nanoparticles is demonstrated by integrating the &#8220;nano&#8208;greenhouse effect&#8221; with plasmonic coupling. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies.








Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g., the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, a synergistic strategy is developed for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4 nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol gCo&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

         <title>Slippery Porous&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Infused Porous Surface (SPIPS) with On&#8208;Demand Responsive Switching between &#8220;Defensive&#8221; and &#8220;Offensive&#8221; Antifouling Modes</title>

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Based Optical Logic Operators Driven by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact optical quantum logic operator based on multifunctional metasurfaces is implemented under a spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed strategy. Such a novel program for optical quantum computing is experimentally validated to achieve high fidelities (99.88%) for all four classical quantum logical gates at ultra&#8208;high operating speeds.








Abstract
In this paper, a novel optical logic operator based on the multifunctional metasurface driven by all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network is reported, which can perform four principal quantum logic operations (Pauli&#8208;X, Pauli&#8208;Y, Pauli&#8208;Z, and Hadamard gates). The two ground states |0&#10217;$|0 \rangle $ and |1&#10217;$|1 \rangle $&#8197;are characterized by two orthogonal linear polarization states. The proposed spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network only contains a hidden layer physically mapped as a metasurface with simple and compact unit cells, which dramatically reduces the volume and computing resources required for the system. The designed optical quantum operator is proven to achieve high fidelities for all four quantum logical gates, up to 99.96% numerically and 99.88% experimentally. The solution will facilitate the construction of large&#8208;scale optical quantum computing systems and scalable optical quantum devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

A free&#8208;standing film composed of titanium dioxide nanotube/silk fibroin is developed by an eco&#8208;friendly way. It is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use platform for capturing and profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells (CTCs) effectively and accurately from the unprocessed blood samples of patients, discriminating the CTCs with different surface biomarkers, showing the potential in molecular typing of breast cancer.








Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides toward cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, it can be tailored into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>Smart&#8208;Responsive HOF Heterostructures with Multiple Spatial&#8208;Resolved Emission Modes toward Photonic Security Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart&#8208;responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first realized based on the differentiated design on high&#8208;electronegative atoms of building blocks, which exhibit dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes, facilitating the construction of responsive photonic barcodes with multiple convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the function&#8208;oriented design of smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterosystem for advanced anticounterfeiting and information security applications.








Abstract
Luminescent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with the unique dynamics and versatile functional sites hold great potential application in information security, yet most of responsive HOFs focus on the single&#8208;component framework with restrained emission control, limiting further applications in advanced confidential information protection. Herein, the first smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterostructure with multiple spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes for covert photonic security platform is reported. The HOF heterostructures are prepared by integrating different HOFs into a single microwire based on a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth method. The distinct responsive behaviors of HOFs permit the heterostructure to simultaneously display the thermochromism via the framework transformation and the acidichromism via the protonation effect, thus generating multiple emission modes. The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes constitute the fingerprint of a heterostructure, and enable the establishment of the smart&#8208;responsive photonic barcode with multiple convert states, which further demonstrate the dynamic coding capability and enhanced security in anticounterfeiting label applications. These results offer a promising route to design function&#8208;oriented smart responsive HOF microdevices toward advanced anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, recognized for their efficient charge transport and high redox capacity, are considered a viable approach to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a double S&#8208;scheme heterojunction featuring spatial dual reduction sites is developed. This design enhances solar hydrogen production and yields a high apparent quantum efficiency. This work contributes a significant approach to the development of more effective S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Although S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis shows promise for photocatalytic hydrogen production, traditional methods often overly concentrate on a single reduction site. This limitation results in inadequate redox capability and inefficient charge separation, which hampers the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, a double S&#8208;scheme system is proposed that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. The design features a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic C3N4. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.2% at 365 nm. This enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is ascribed to the efficient charge separation and transport induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ) affirm the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. The findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;alkanediols with an optimal chain length are unveiled as highly potent low&#8208;volume concentration electrolyte additives to address the zinc anode rechargeability for the practical development of aqueous zinc batteries. A machine learning&#8208;based model that maps the performance relative to critical additive physicochemical descriptors is presented, which can lead the way for a rational approach to additive design and discoveries.








Abstract
The essential virtues of aqueous zinc battery chemistry stem from the energy&#8208;dense zinc metal anode and mild aqueous electrolytes. Yet, their incompatibility &#8211; as exposed by zinc's corrosion and associated dendrite problem &#8211; poses a challenge to achieving improved cycle life under practically relevant parameters. While electrolyte additives are a scalable strategy, additives that can function at low volume concentrations remain elusive. Here, through screening alkanol and alkanediol chemistries, 1,2&#8208;butanediol and pentanediol are unveiled as highly potent additives, which operate at a practical 1 volume% concentration owing to their ability to furnish dynamic solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase through pronounced interfacial filming. This unique mechanistic action renders effective corrosion and dendrite mitigation, resulting in up to five to twenty&#8208;fold zinc cyclability enhancement with a high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.9%) and improved full&#8208;cell performance under demanding conditions, including at elevated temperatures. A machine learning&#8208;based analysis is presented to rationalize the additive performance relative to critical physicochemical descriptors, which can pave the way for a rational approach to efficient additive discoveries.

&lt;p&gt;1,2-alkanediols with an optimal chain length are unveiled as highly potent low-volume concentration electrolyte additives to address the zinc anode rechargeability for the practical development of aqueous zinc batteries. A machine learning-based model that maps the performance relative to critical additive physicochemical descriptors is presented, which can lead the way for a rational approach to additive design and discoveries.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on CrN Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atomic layers catalysts with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites and epitaxial strain are successfully grown on low&#8208;cost CrN nanoparticles via a facile thermal ammonlysis method. The Pt atomic layers on CrN electrocatalyst deliver outstanding activity and durability for the formic acid oxidation reaction, guiding the development of low&#8208;cost Pt&#8208;based catalysts for various applications.








Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) is utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt atomic layers&#160;catalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibits excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 that is 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polypeptides containing semicarbazide moieties via direct polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) based monomers. These polypeptides can be further decorated with ketone/aldehyde&#8208;containing agents with the formation of pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages. The intracellular acidic pH&#8208;triggered release promotes drug escape from endolysosomes and enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, which can be also employed for highly sensitive detection of tumor lesions.








Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyester nanofiltration membrane for cation separation is prepared by interfacial polymerization of TET with TMC. The &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities in the TET confer the TET&#8208;TMC membrane with dense structures and positive surface charge, leading to MgCl2 retention (95.5%) significantly higher than other polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%).








Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designs a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer undergoes efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;offs (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4&#160;mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel NIR Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound FWHM Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:0.05Cr3+ exhibits impressive external quantum efficiency and output power. MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ undergoes a transition from ultra&#8208;narrowband to ultra&#8208;broadband emission as the Cr3+ concentration increased, driven by energy transfer between the three emitting centers.








Abstract
There is strong demand for ultraefficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;(LED)&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED (pc&#8208;LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

In this study, novel near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode&#160;(LED)-excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (MAGBO:Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), with three emission centers achieve ultra-narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra-broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature-dependent decay times. The ultra-broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra-broadband NIR pc-LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high-performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphors Based on CuInSe2 Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for Micro&#8208;LEDs Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors based on CuInSe2 quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaking from 750 to 1150&#160;nm and a high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.8% are reported. Notably, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an output power of 88.7mW@350&#160;mA and bright micro&#8208;LEDs arrays with diameters less than 5&#160;&#181;m are achieved based on these QDs.








Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent nanomaterials are urgently required for portable mini or micro phosphors&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). However, most existing NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors are generally restricted by their low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) or large particle size. Herein, a kind of highly efficient NIR nanophosphors is developed based on copper indium selenide quantum dots (CISe QDs). The PL peak of these QDs can be exquisitely manipulated from 750 to 1150&#160;nm by altering the stoichiometry of Cu/In and doping with Zn2+. Their absolute PLQY can be significantly improved from 28.6% to 92.8% via coating a ZnSe shell. By combining the phosphors with a commercial blue chip, an NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with remarkable photostability and a record&#8208;high radiant flux of 88.7 mW@350&#160;mA among the Pb/Cd&#8208;free QDs&#8208;based NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. Particularly, such QDs&#8208;based nanophosphors acted as excellent luminescence converter for NIR micro&#8208;LEDs with microarray diameters below 5&#160;&#181;m, which significantly exceeds the resolutions of current commercial inkjet display pixels. The findings may open new avenues for the exploration of highly efficient NIR micro&#8208;LEDs in a variety of applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

     alt="Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on-site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on-site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on-site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi-detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor-treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell-entry receptors conjugated to N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi-detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi-screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase is developed to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ induces extracellular bacterial ferroptosis via photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic properties and assists macrophages against intracellular bacteria via ferroportin&#8208;mediated bacterial ferroptosis and hunger&#8208;triggered AMPK pathway&#8208;mediated cell protection, elevating the biocompatibility of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated therapeutic strategies.








Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, this work has designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible paper&#8208;based scaffold exhibiting gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size is fabricated using an industrially compatible papermaking process. This triple&#8208;gradient design controls the Mg ion flux for bottom&#8208;up deposition, facilitating superior cyclability. The high flexibility and minimal thickness of the scaffold align well with the emerging demand for flexible and wearable electronics, signaling a robust pathway for their advancement.








Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform magnesium (Mg) nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design is achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers is meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enables the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual reinforcement of ferroptosis and antitumor immunity is a promising strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy. Effective interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;)&#160;delivery sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis induced by an ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanocarrier. Immunogenic cancer cell death and tumor microenvironment modulation evoke strong immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T cells released IFN&#947; in turn promotes ferroptosis occurrence.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN&#947;) (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery&#8208;induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Robust Ru&#8208;VO2 Bifunctional Catalysts for All&#8208;pH Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;VO2 catalysts containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles are synthesized, and it shows excellent water splitting performance in all&#8208;pH range. The in&#8208;situ characterizations and Theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that synergy of Ru Nanoparticles and Ru&#8208;doped VO2 breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly boosts the acidic oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Designing robust bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction in all&#8208;pH conditions for overall water splitting (OWS) is an effective way to achieve sustainable development. Herein, a composite Ru&#8208;VO2 containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized, and it shows a high OWS performance in full&#8208;pH range due to their synergist effect. In particular, the OER mass activities of Ru&#8208;VO2 at 1.53 V (vs RHE) in acidic, alkaline, and PBS solutions are &#8776;65, 36, and 235 times of commercial RuO2 in the same conditions. The &#8220;Ru&#8208;VO2 || Ru&#8208;VO2&#8221; two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.515 V (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic water splitting, which can operate stably for 125 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without significant voltage decay. In situ Raman spectra and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry prove that the OER of Ru&#8208;VO2 in acid follows the adsorption evolution mechanism. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the synergistic effect between Ru NP and Ru&#8208;doped VO2, which breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly enhances the OER activity. This work provides new insights into the design of novel bifunctional pH&#8208;universal catalysts for OWS.

Ultraconfined Plasmons
In article number 2302520, J. Enrique Ortega, F. Javier Garc&#237;a de Abajo, and co&#8208;workers present a new approach to fabricating ultrathin crystalline silver films consisting of a few atomic layers in thickness and featuring collective electron oscillations&#8212;plasmons&#8212;with an unprecedented combination of spatial confinement and long lifetimes. The image illustrates one of those structures, where bowtie pillars are carved from a silicon wafer, followed by a chemical and physical treatment that flattens the upper surface, and subsequent epitaxial deposition of a controlled number of silver (111) atomic layers. The resulting silver bowtie structures present confined plasmons at the gap region with a quality factor (spectral frequency&#8208;to&#8208;width ratio) approaching ten and a spatial footprint of a few tens of nanometers.

Intracranial Drug Delivery
In article number 2306876 by Niandong Jiao, Anhua Wu, Lianqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers, a marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. A magnetic catheter robot goes through a minimally invasive channel on the skull and enters deep into the brain along a curved path. The hollow catheter robot releases nanorobots when reaching the location of the brain tumor. Then the nanorobots further advance to the tumor and release the loaded drugs to kill the brain tumor.

Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers
In article number 2308344, Min Li, Xiaolei Zuo, and co&#8208;workers used synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. They demonstrate the amperometric monitoring of vesicle assemblies using nanoelectrode with high precision. The further application in vivo enables to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vesicle clusters in cells and release events heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.

Optical Quantum Computing
In article number 2308993, Xumin Ding, Shah Nawaz Burokur, Guangwei Hu, and co&#8208;workers report an optical quantum logic operator with high fidelity. The device is driven by an all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network, while combining polarization&#8208; and spatial&#8208;multiplexing strategies to achieve four classical quantum gates. This work substantially improves the integration and flexibility of quantum computing systems.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article critically summarizes the recent literature on 3D printable materials and structures with self&#8208;healing characteristics, emphasizing the intimate relationship between chemical and physical properties and printability, toward the design and fabrication of advanced components. Moreover, it highlights actual applications, envisaging future directions of investigation.








Abstract
This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. The review will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

         <title>Technology and Integration Roadmap for Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) can emulate neurological functions within a bionic computing architecture, enabling energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing. Identifying suitable techniques for integrating materials into integrated circuit platforms is imperative to advance the field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanism, structures, applications, and integration roadmap of OMs aiming to establish a connection between materials and OM systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large&#8208;scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power in&#8208;memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low&#8208;dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.

         <title>Engineered Synthetic Matrices for Human Intestinal Organoid Culture and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and delivery vehicles in therapeutic applications. 








Abstract
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling in vitro, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration and therapeutic advances in vivo. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and differentiation. These hydrogels allow for tuning the mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix, offering an advantage over biologically derived hydrogels such as Matrigel. Human intestinal organoids have been used for repopulating transplantable intestinal grafts and for in vivo delivery to an injured intestinal site. The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of 2D Graphene&#8208;Derived Ion Channels for Water&#8208;Based Green Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational materials selection/design and thorough mechanism research in water&#8208;based green energy conversion are essential scientific issues to be imminently discussed for future development of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) through interfacial assembly. Such review and prospects about 2D&#8208;GDIC from synthesis to applications including stability and functionalization would also provide a reference for other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels.








Abstract
The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D&#8208;GDICs are summarized and their ion transport properties are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of 2D graphene-derived ion channels (2D-GDICs) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D-GDICs are summarized and their ion transport properties are discussed. This review analyzes how particular structure and charge density/distribution of 2D-GDIC can be modulated to minimize internal resistance of ion/fluid transport and enhance energy conversion efficiency, and highlights stimuli-responsive functions and stability of 2D-GDIC and further examines the possibility of integrating 2D-GDIC with other energy conversion systems. Notably, the presented preparation and applications of 2D-GDIC also inspire and guide other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels for targeted applications. Finally, potential challenges in this field is analyzed and a prospect to future developments toward high-performance or large-scale real-word applications is offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Kirigami Frameworks Toward Real&#8208;World Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basic deformation mechanisms inherent to kirigami design, summarizes the most distinguished properties of kirigami induced by cutting and folding, and overviews how each property can be leveraged to tackle challenges across various domains. It envisions that this work will inspire further innovation in metamaterials and encourage the community to address the challenges posed by real&#8208;world&#160;applications.








Abstract
The surge in advanced manufacturing techniques has led to a paradigm shift in the realm of material design from developing completely new chemistry to tailoring geometry within existing materials. Kirigami, evolved from a traditional cultural and artistic craft of cutting and folding, has emerged as a powerful framework that endows simple 2D sheets with unique mechanical, thermal, optical, and acoustic properties, as well as shape&#8208;shifting capabilities. Given its flexibility, versatility, and ease of fabrication, there are significant efforts in developing kirigami algorithms to create various architectured materials for a wide range of applications. This review summarizes the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transformation of kirigami structures and elucidates how these mechanisms contribute to their distinctive properties, including high stretchability and adaptability, tunable surface topography, programmable shape morphing, and characteristics of bistability and multistability. It then highlights several promising applications enabled by the unique kirigami designs and concludes with an outlook on the future challenges and perspectives of kirigami&#8208;inspired metamaterials toward real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Strain Engineering in Perovskites: Mutual Insight on Oxides and Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide and halide perovskites play a key role in various energy conversion devices such as piezoelectric devices, catalysts, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors. This review covers the latest studies on strain engineering in both oxide and halide perovskites for energy conversion devices. The work provides a new insight that can lead breakthroughs for high performance energy conversion devices.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention over the past decades due to their applications, not only in electronic materials, such as dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and superconductors but also in optoelectronic devices like solar cells and light emitting diodes. This interest arises from their versatile combinations and physiochemical tunability. While strain engineering is a recognized powerful tool for tailoring material properties, its collaborative impact on both oxides and halides remains understudied. Herein, strain engineering in perovskites for energy conversion devices, providing mutual insight into both oxides and halides is discussed. The various experimental methods are presented for applying strain by using thermal mismatch, lattice mismatch, defects, doping, light illumination, and flexible substrates. In addition, the main factors that are influenced by strain, categorized as structure (e.g., symmetry breaking, octahedral distortion), bandgap, chemical reactivity, and defect formation energy are described. After that, recent progress in strain engineering for perovskite oxides and halides for energy conversion devices is introduced. Promising methods for enhancing the performance of energy conversion devices using perovskites through strain engineering are suggested.

         <title>Active Materials for Functional Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origami has emerged as a popular design strategy for engineering structures. Further, active materials can be integrated with origami for lightweight, programmable, self&#8208;deployable structures relevant to numerous aerospace, metamaterial, and biomedical applications. This review details active material actuation mechanisms, active origami applications, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods, as well as origami modeling, and provides insights into the future of active origami research.








Abstract
In recent decades, origami has been explored to aid in the design of engineering structures. These structures span multiple scales and have been demonstrated to be used toward various areas such as aerospace, metamaterial, biomedical, robotics, and architectural applications. Conventionally, origami or deployable structures have been actuated by hands, motors, or pneumatic actuators, which can result in heavy or bulky structures. On the other hand, active materials, which reconfigure in response to external stimulus, eliminate the need for external mechanical loads and bulky actuation systems. Thus, in recent years, active materials incorporated with deployable structures have shown promise for remote actuation of light weight, programmable origami. In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) and alloys (SMAs), hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), magnetic soft materials (MSMs), and covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.

         <title>Review&#8212;Extremely Thin Amorphous Indium Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high performance devices beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductors. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research are reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductor transistors have been a mature technology in display panels for upward of a decade, and have recently been considered as promising back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible channel materials for monolithic 3D applications. However, achieving high&#8208;mobility amorphous semiconductor materials with comparable performance to traditional crystalline semiconductors has been a long&#8208;standing problem. Recently it has been found that greatly reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high mobility, high drive current, high on/off ratio, and enhancement&#8208;mode operation at the same time, beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductor materials. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices are reviewed.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface.

&lt;p&gt;Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well-performing donor-dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor-dilute device concept.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge-transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO-4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7-Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor-dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top-electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low-bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO-4F-based OPVs with limited PTB7-Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8-series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light-utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
