         <title>Efficient Thermo&#8208;Spin Conversion in van der Waals Ferromagnet FeGaTe</title>

Abstract
Recent discovery of two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials has spurred progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in enhancing the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency for building spin&#8208;logic or spin&#8208;memory devices. Here, we&#160;systematically investigated the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects to uncover significant spin&#8208;conversion effects in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anomalous Hall effect demonstrated an efficient electric spin&#8208;charge conversion with a notable spin Hall angle over 6%. In addition, the anomalous Nernst effect produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature without a magnetic field, displaying unique temperature dependence with a maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient of 440 nV/K and a Nernst angle of approximately 62%. Such innovative thermoelectric signal arises from the efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion effect, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in the opposite directions under a temperature gradient. The present study highlights the potential of FeGaTe to enhance thermoelectric devices through efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion, without the need for a magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Hot&#8208;pressing Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks as Personal Protection Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Effective personal protection is crucial for controlling infectious disease spread. However, commonly used personal protective materials such as disposable masks lack antibacterial/antiviral function and may lead to cross infection. Herein, we proposed a polyethylene glycol assisted solvent&#8208;free strategy to rapidly synthesize a series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) (i.e., GZHMU&#8208;2, JNM&#8208;1 and JNM&#8208;2) under air atmosphere and henceforth extend it via in&#8208;situ hot&#8208;pressing process to prepare MCOFs based films with photocatalytic disinfect ability. Best of them, the newly designed GZHMU&#8208;2 has a wide absorption spectrum (200&#160;nm to 1500&#160;nm) and can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species under sunlight irradiation, achieving excellent photocatalytic disinfection performance. After in&#8208;situ hot&#8208;pressing as a film material, the obtained GZHMU&#8208;2/NMF can effectively kill E. coli (99.99%), S. aureus (99%), and H1N1 (92.5%), meanwhile possessing good reusability. Noteworthy, the long&#8208;term use of GZHMU&#8208;2/NWF based mask has verified no damage to the living body by measuring the expression of mouse blood routine, lung tissue and inflammatory factors at the in&#8208;vivo level.

         <title>Intracavitary Spraying of Nanoregulator&#8208;Encased Hydrogel Modulates Cholesterol Metabolism of Glioma&#8208;Supportive Macrophage for Postoperative Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notoriously resistant to immunotherapy due to its intricate tumor microenvironment (TME). Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is implicated in the immunosuppressive TME and promotes tumor progression. Here, we found that cholesterol levels in GBM tissues are abnormally high, and glioma&#8208;supportive macrophages (GSMs), an essential &#8220;cholesterol factory&#8221;, demonstrated aberrantly hyperactive cholesterol metabolism and efflux, providing cholesterol to fuel GBM growth and induce CD8+ T cells exhaustion. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis confirmed that high 7&#8208;dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) level in GBM tissues was concomitant with increased cholesterol biosynthesis, suppressed tumoricidal immune response, and poor patient survival, and DHCR7 expression level was significantly elevated in GSMs. Therefore, we reported an intracavitary sprayable nanoregulator&#8208;encased hydrogel system to modulate cholesterol metabolism of GSMs. The degradable nanoregulator mediated ablation of DHCR7 in GSMs effectively suppressed cholesterol supply and activated T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the combination of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonists significantly promoted GSMs polarization to antitumor phenotypes and ameliorated the immunosuppressive TME. Treatment with the hybrid system exhibited superior antitumor effects in orthotopic GBM tumor model and postsurgical recurrence model. Altogether, our findings unravel the role of GSMs DHCR7/cholesterol signaling in the regulation of immunosuppressive TME, presenting a potential GBM treatment strategy that warrants further clinical trials.

         <title>19.32% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by Fine&#8208;Tuning Stacking Modes of Y&#8208;Type Molecule Acceptors: Synergistic Bromine and Fluorine Substitution of the End Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking modes of Y&#8208;type small molecule acceptors are fine&#8208;tuned by synergistic bromine and fluorine substitution of the end groups for achieving high power conversion efficiencies of 18.34% and 19.32% in binary and ternary blend devices.








Abstract
The success of Y6&#8208;type nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be attributed to their unique honeycomb stacking style, which leads to favorable thin&#8208;film morphologies. The intermolecular interactions related to the crystallization tendency of these NF&#8208;SMAs is closely governed by their electron accepting end groups. For example, the high performance Y6 derivative L8&#8208;BO (BTP&#8208;4F) presents three types of stacking modes in contrast to two stacking modes of Y6. Hence, it is ultimately interesting to obtain more insight on the packing properties and the preferences influenced by chemical modifications such as end group engineering. This work designs and synthesizes asymmetric and symmetric L8&#8208;BO derivatives with brominated end groups and explores the stacking preferences in various modes. The asymmetric BTP&#8208;3FBr displays an optimized crystallization tendency and thin film morphology, leading to a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34% in binary devices and a top PCE of 19.32% in ternary devices containing 15 wt% IDIC as the second acceptor.

         <title>Atmospheric Humidity Underlies Irreproducibility of Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are infamous for their batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch and lab&#8208;to&#8208;lab irreproducibility in terms of stability and performance. Reproducible fabrication of PSCs is a critical requirement for market viability and practical commercialization. PSC irreproducibility plagues all levels of the community; from institutional research laboratories, start&#8208;up companies, to large established corporations. In this work, we unravel the critical function of atmospheric humidity to regulate the crystallization and stabilization of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites. We demonstrate that the humidity content during processing induces profound variations in perovskite stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability, and optoelectronic quality. Almost counterintuitively, we show that the presence of humidity is perhaps indispensable to reproduce phase stable and efficient FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

Abstract
Soft electronic circuits are crucial for wearable electronics, biomedical technologies and soft robotics, requiring soft conductive materials with high conductivity, high strain limit and stable electrical performance under deformation. Liquid metals (LMs) have become an attractive candidate with high conductivity and fluidic compliance, while effective manufacturing methods are demanded. Digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based projection lithography is a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput printing technique for primarily polymers and some metals. If LMs can be printed with DLP as well, the entire soft devices can be fabricated by one printer in a streamlined and highly&#8208;efficient process. Herein, we achieved fast and facile DLP&#8208;based liquid metal printing. Simply with 5&#8211;10 seconds of patterned UV&#8208;light exposure, a highly conductive and stretchable pattern can be printed using a photo&#8208;crosslinkable LM particle ink. The printed eutectic gallium indium traces feature high resolution (&#8764;20 &#956;m), conductivity (3.0&#215;106 S m&#8722;1), stretchability (&#8764;2500%) and excellent stability (consistent performance at different deformation). Various patterns have been printed in diverse material systems for broad applications, including stretchable displays, epidermal strain sensors, heaters, humidity sensors, conformal electrodes for electrography, and multi&#8208;layer actuators. The facile and scalable process, the excellent performance, diverse applications ensure its broad impact on soft electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Frank Partial Dislocations in Coplanar Ir/C Ultrathin Nanosheets Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets consisting of Ir nanoparticles with rich Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) and carbon in a coplanar structure (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) are synthesized first by using a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200&#160;&#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. The Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent catalytic performance due to ultrathin nanosheet structures with both FPDs and coplanar surfaces.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable acidic hydrogen evolution catalysts is of great significance and challenge for the long&#8208;term operation of commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this work, coplanar ultrathin nanosheets composed of rich&#8208;Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) are first synthesized. Ir nanoparticles and carbon (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) use a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200 &#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a remarkably high mass activity of 6.64 A mg&#8722;1 at 50 mV, which is among the best Ir&#8208;based catalysts.In addition, Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs are able to operate stably at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 200 h as a cathode in a PEM electrolyser, and the original coplanar ultrathin nanosheets structure are maintained after the test, demonstrating excellent stability against stacking and agglomeration. Geometrical phase analysis and theoretical calculations show that the FPDs produce a 4% compressive strain in the Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs, and the compressive strain weaken the adsorption of H* by Ir, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Chiral quantum materials: when chemistry meets physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental property of nature with relevance in biochemistry and physics, particularly in the field of catalysis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying chirality transfer is crucial for advancing our knowledge of chiral&#8208;related catalysis. Chiral quantum materials with intriguing chirality&#8208;dependent electronic properties, such as spin&#8208;orbital coupling and exotic spin/orbital angular momentum, open novel avenues for linking solid&#8208;state topologies with chiral catalysis. In this review, we describe the growth of topological homochiral crystals (THCs) and summarize their applications in heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen electrocatalysis, and asymmetric catalysis. A possible link between chirality&#8208;dependent electronic properties and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed. Finally, existing challenges in this field are highlighted, and a brief outlook on the impact of THCs on the overarching chemical&#8211;physical research is presented.

         <title>Elucidation of Protonation Cooperativity of a STING&#8208;Activating Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physicochemical investigation of a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer, PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PC7A, reveals a protonation cooperativity driven by nanophase transition. This pH&#8208;triggered cooperative system of PC7A highlights a binary proton distribution between disassembled cationic unimers and self&#8208;assembled neutral micelles. The implementation of molecular cooperativity of self&#8208;assembled nanosystems inspires an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing design principle to achieve spatiotemporal precision.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials have the potential to improve the performance and overcome existing barriers of conventional nanotherapeutics. Molecular cooperativity design in stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine can amplify physiological signals, enabling a cooperative response for improved diagnostic and therapeutic precision. Previously, this work reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer, PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PC7A, that possesses innate immune activating properties by binding to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through polyvalent phase condensation. This interaction enhances STING activation and synergizes with the endogenous STING ligand for robust cancer immunotherapy. Despite its successes in innate immune activation, the fundamental physicochemical and pH&#8208;responsive properties of PC7A require further investigation. Here, this study elucidates the protonation cooperativity driven by the phase transition of PC7A copolymer. The highly cooperative system displays an &#8220;all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing&#8221; proton distribution between highly charged unimer (all) and neutral micelle (nothing) states without gradually protonated intermediates. The binary protonation behavior is further illustrated in pH&#8208;precision&#8208;controlled release of a representative anticancer drug, &#946;&#8208;lapachone, by PC7A micelles over a noncooperative PE5A polymer. Furthermore, the bimodal distribution of protons is represented by a high Hill coefficient (nH&#160;&gt;&#160;9), featuring strong positive cooperativity. This study highlights the nanoscale pH cooperativity of an immune activating polymer, providing insights into the physicochemical characterization and design parameters for future nanotherapeutics development.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Like Tropisms in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant tropism, artificial muscles are developed that allow adaptive actuation in response to environmental humidity and temperature variations. The use of plant&#8208;like microstructural memories enables the yarn muscles to imitate the hydrotropism and thermotropism of plant tendrils. The developed muscle has the potential to perform on&#8208;demand autonomous work in applications including disaster response, autonomous surveying, and sensitive prosthetics.








Helical plants have the ability of tropisms to respond to natural stimuli, and biomimicry of such helical shapes into artificial muscles has been vastly popular. However, the shape&#8208;mimicked actuators only respond to artificially provided stimulus, they are not adaptive to variable natural conditions, thus being unsuitable for real&#8208;life applications where on&#8208;demand, autonomous operations are required. Novel artificial muscles made of hierarchically patterned helically wound yarns that are self&#8208;adaptive to environmental humidity and temperature changes are demonstrated here. Unlike shape&#8208;mimicked artificial muscles, a unique microstructural biomimicking approach is adopted, where the muscle yarns can effectively replicate the hydrotropism and thermotropism of helical plants to their microfibril level using plant&#8208;like microstructural memories. Large strokes, with rapid movement, are obtained when the individual microfilament of yarn is inlaid with hydrogel and further twisted into a coil&#8208;shaped hierarchical structure. The developed artificial muscle provides an average actuation speed of &#8776;5.2% s&#8722;1 at expansion and &#8776;3.1% s&#8722;1 at contraction cycles, being the fastest amongst previously demonstrated actuators of similar type. It is demonstrated that these muscle yarns can autonomously close a window in wet climates. The building block yarns are washable without any material degradation, making them suitable for smart, reusable textile and soft robotic devices.

         <title>High Entropy Oxides Modulate Atomic&#8208;Level Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are introduced as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) to address the electrostatic repulsion between Zn2+ and conventional oxides. Benefiting from the extended &#603;d band and robust structures, the optimized HEOs achieve outstanding rate capabilities (136.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term stability (115.3 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles) in AZIBs.








Abstract
The strong electrostatic interaction between high&#8208;charge&#8208;density zinc ions (112 C mm&#8722;3) and the fixed crystallinity of traditional oxide cathodes with delayed charge compensation hinders the development of high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to intrinsically promote electron transfer efficiency and improve lattice tolerance, a revolutionary family of high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) materials with multipath electron transfer and remarkable structural stability as cathodes for AZIBs is proposed. Benefiting from the unique &#8220;cock&#8208;tail&#8221; effect, the interaction of diverse type metal&#8208;atoms in HEOs achieves essentially broadened d&#8208;band and lower degeneracy than monometallic oxides, which contribute to convenient electron transfer and one of the best rate&#8208;performances (136.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) in AZIBs. In addition, the intense lattice strain field of HEOs is highly tolerant to the electrostatic repulsion of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density Zn2+, leading to&#160;the&#160;outstanding cycling stability in AZIBs. Moreover, the super selectability of elements in HEOs exhibits significant potential for AZIBs.

         <title>Mechanistic Computational Modeling of Implantable, Bioresorbable Drug Release Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mathematical treatment of polymer solidification, degradation, and diffusivity accurately predicts drug release profiles from a range of size and molecular weight. This mechanistic model offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on polymer degradation and drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for tailored release systems.








Abstract
Implantable, bioresorbable drug delivery systems offer an alternative to current drug administration techniques; allowing for patient&#8208;tailored drug dosage, while also increasing patient compliance. Mechanistic mathematical modeling allows for the acceleration of the design of the release systems, and for prediction of physical anomalies that are not intuitive and may otherwise elude discovery. This study investigates short&#8208;term drug release as a function of water&#8208;mediated polymer phase inversion into a solid depot within hours to days, as well as long&#8208;term hydrolysis&#8208;mediated degradation and erosion of the implant over the next few weeks. Finite difference methods are used to model spatial and temporal changes in polymer phase inversion, solidification, and hydrolysis. Modeling reveals the impact of non&#8208;uniform drug distribution, production and transport of H+ ions, and localized polymer degradation on the diffusion of water, drug, and hydrolyzed polymer byproducts. Compared to experimental data, the computational model accurately predicts the drug release during the solidification of implants over days and drug release profiles over weeks from microspheres and implants. This work offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for release systems to meet a patient specific clinical need.

         <title>Engineering Relaxor Behavior in (BaTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor&#8208;like behavior, typically associated with chemical inhomogeneity in solid solutions, is experimentally observed across a range of (BaTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n (n = 4&#8211;20 unit cells) superlattices. Bond&#8208;valence molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations suggest that relaxor&#8208;like behavior in shorter&#8208;period superlattices arises from temperature&#8208;driven size variations of antipolar stripe domains in contrast to more thermally stable dipolar configurations in longer&#8208;period superlattices.








Abstract
Complex&#8208;oxide superlattices provide a pathway to numerous emergent phenomena because of the juxtaposition of disparate properties and the strong interfacial interactions in these unit&#8208;cell&#8208;precise structures. This is particularly true in superlattices of ferroelectric and dielectric materials, wherein new forms of ferroelectricity, exotic dipolar textures, and distinctive domain structures can be produced. Here, relaxor&#8208;like behavior, typically associated with the chemical inhomogeneity and complexity of solid solutions, is observed in (BaTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n (n = 4&#8211;20 unit cells) superlattices. Dielectric studies and subsequent Vogel&#8211;Fulcher analysis show significant frequency dispersion of the dielectric maximum across a range of periodicities, with enhanced dielectric constant and more robust relaxor behavior for smaller period n. Bond&#8208;valence molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations predict the relaxor&#8208;like behavior observed experimentally, and interpretations of the polar patterns via 2D discrete&#8208;wavelet transforms in shorter&#8208;period superlattices suggest that the relaxor behavior arises from shape variations of the dipolar configurations, in contrast to frozen antipolar stripe domains in longer&#8208;period superlattices (n = 16). Moreover, the size and shape of the dipolar configurations are tuned by superlattice periodicity, thus providing a definitive design strategy to use superlattice layering to create relaxor&#8208;like behavior which may expand the ability to control desired properties in these complex systems.

         <title>Crystallization Control for Ambient Printed FA&#8208;Based Lead Triiodide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization dynamics of &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskites during ambient blade coating are manipulated by employing an additive 1&#8208;butylpyridine tetrafluoroborate (BPyBF4), resulting in the highly crystalline perovskite film with large grains, eliminated voids, and reduced defects. This enables the high power conversion efficiencies of 23.50% and 21.60% for a 0.09 cm2 area device and a 5&#160;cm &#215; 5 cm&#8208;area module, respectively.








Abstract
Upscalable printing of high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is highly desired for commercialization. However, the efficiencies of printed PSCs lag behind those of their lab&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coated counterparts owing to the lack of systematic understanding and control over perovskite crystallization dynamics. Here, the controlled crystallization dynamics achieved using an additive 1&#8208;butylpyridine tetrafluoroborate (BPyBF4) for high&#8208;quality ambient printed &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films are reported. Using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and optical diagnostics, the spontaneous formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from precursors during printing without the involvement of &#160;&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is demonstrated. The addition of BPyBF4 delays the crystallization onset of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhances the conversion from sol&#8208;gel to perovskite, and reduces stacking defects during printing. Therefore, the altered crystallization results in fewer voids, larger grains, and less trap&#8208;induced recombination loss within printed films. The printed PSCs yield high power conversion efficiencies of 23.50% and 21.60% for a&#160;0.09 cm&#8211;2area device and a 5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm&#8208;area module, respectively. Improved device stability is further demonstrated, i.e., approximately 94% of the initial efficiency is retained for over 2400&#160;h under ambient conditions without encapsulation. This study provides an effective crystallization control method for the ambient printing manufacture of large&#8208;area high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature van der Waals Ferromagnet Switching by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torques</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;torque (SOT) driven perpendicular magnetization switching in the van der Waals Fe3GaTe2 at room temperature is achieved with a relatively low critical current density of 1.3 &#215; 107 A cm&#8722;2. These results offer new opportunities to breakthrough the downscaled problem of SOT&#8208;magnetic random&#8208;access memory based on 3D ferromagnets.








Abstract
The emerging wide varieties of the van der Waals (vdW) magnets with atomically thin and smooth interfaces hold great promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, due to the lower Curie temperature of the vdW ferromagnets than room temperature, electrically manipulating its magnetization at room temperature has not been realized. In this work, it is demonstrated that the perpendicular magnetization of the vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 can be effectively switched at room temperature in the Fe3GaTe2/Pt bilayer by spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) with a relatively low current density of 1.3 &#215; 107A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high SOT efficiency of &#958;DL &#8776; 0.28 is quantitatively determined by harmonic measurements, which is higher than those in Pt&#8208;based heavy metal/conventional ferromagnet devices. The findings of room&#8208;temperature vdW ferromagnet switching by SOTs provide a significant basis for the development of vdW&#8208;ferromagnet&#8208;based spintronic applications.

         <title>Tuneable Anisotropic Plasmonics with Shape&#8208;Symmetric Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional anisotropic nanoantennas have asymmetric shape. In this work, symmetry is instead broken by straining of a conducting polymer, leading to an in&#8208;plane anisotropic plasma frequency. This enables circularly symmetric nanoantennas with polarization&#8208;dependent localized surface plasmon resonances. The polarization dependence is consistent with inverse changes of the effective mass and mobility of thecharge carriers along different in&#8208;plane directions.








Abstract
A wide range of nanophotonic applications rely on polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances, which usually requires metallic nanostructures that have anisotropic shape. This work demonstrates polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances instead by breaking symmetry via material permittivity. The study shows that molecular alignment of a conducting polymer can lead to a material with polarization&#8208;dependent plasma frequency and corresponding in&#8208;plane hyperbolic permittivity region. This result is not expected based only on anisotropic charge mobility but implies that also the effective mass of the charge carriers becomes anisotropic upon polymer alignment. This unique feature is used to demonstrate circularly symmetric nanoantennas that provide different plasmonic resonances parallel and perpendicular to the alignment direction. The nanoantennas are further tuneable via the redox state of the polymer. Importantly, polymer alignment could blueshift the plasma wavelength and resonances by several hundreds of nanometers, forming a novel approach toward reaching the ultimate goal of redox&#8208;tunable conducting polymer nanoantennas for visible light.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Erbium&#8208;Metallofullerenes toward Switchable Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescent property of monometallic cyanide clusterfullerenes is investigated. By encapsulating a triangular erbium (Er)&#8208;cyanide cluster into a C2(5)&#8208;C82 cage, photoluminescence of mono&#8208;Er&#8208;metallofullerene is switched on. Combined with three medium&#8208;bandgap di&#8208;erbium&#8208;metallofullerenes, the bandgap threshold for judging whether an Er&#8208;metallofullerenes is photoluminescent is determined to be between 0.83 and 0.74&#160;eV.








Abstract
Encapsulating photoluminescent lanthanide ions like erbium (Er) into fullerene cages affords photoluminescent endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). Few reported photoluminescent Er&#8208;EMFs are all based on encapsulation of multiple (two to three) metal atoms, whereas mono&#8208;Er&#8208;EMFs exemplified by Er@C82 are not photoluminescent due to its narrow optical bandgap. Herein, by entrapping an Er&#8208;cyanide cluster into various C82 cages to form novel Er&#8208;monometallic cyanide clusterfullerenes (CYCFs), ErCN@C82 (C2(5), Cs(6), and C2v(9)), the photoluminescent properties of CYCFs are investigated, and obvious near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence only is observed for ErCN@C2(5)&#8208;C82. Combined with a comparative photoluminescence study of three medium&#8208;bandgap di&#8208;Er&#8208;EMFs, including Er2@Cs(6)&#8208;C82, Er2O@Cs(6)&#8208;C82, and Er2C2@Cs(6)&#8208;C82, this study proposes that the optical bandgap can be used as a simple criterion for switching the photoluminescence of Er&#8208;EMFs, and the bandgap threshold is determined to be between 0.83 and 0.74&#160;eV. Furthermore, the photoluminescent patterns of these three di&#8208;Er&#8208;EMFs differ dramatically. It is found that the location of the Er atom within the same Cs(6)&#8208;C82 cage is almost fixed and independent on the endo&#8208;unit; thus the previous statement on the key role of metal position in photoluminescence of di&#8208;Er&#8208;EMFs seems erroneous, and the geometric configuration of the endo&#8208;unit, especially the bridging mode of two Er ions, is decisive instead.

         <title>KERS&#8208;Inspired Nanostructured Mineral Coatings Boost IFN&#8208;&#947; mRNA Therapeutic Index for Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytokines play an important role in tumor immunotherapy but are easily degraded. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy; however, its efficacy remains modest due to the low bioactivity of the recombinant cytokines used for TAM reprogramming. mRNA therapeutics are capable of generating fully functional proteins for various therapeutic purposes but accused for its poor sustainability. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS) is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycles nearly 40% expressed cytokines by capturing them onto the mineral coating to extend its therapeutic timeframe, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors. Notably, interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;) produced by CERS exhibits &#8776;42&#8208;fold higher biological activity than recombinant IFN&#8208;&#947;, remarkably decreasing the required IFN&#8208;&#947; dosage for TAM reprogramming. In tumor&#8208;bearing mice, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS effectively polarizes TAMs to inhibit osteosarcoma progression. When combined with the PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS significantly boosts antitumor immune responses, and substantially prevents malignant lung metastases. Thus, CERS&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery represents a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity for tumor treatment.

         <title>Synthesis of 2H/fcc&#8208;Heterophase AuCu Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2H/fcc&#8208;heterophase AuCu hierarchical nanostructures, i.e., Au99Cu1 and Au91Cu9, are synthesized via a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets show superior performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction toward the CO production at industrial current densities due to the unique structural features, including unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. 








Abstract
Structural engineering of nanomaterials offers a promising way for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts toward catalysis. However, the delicate modulation of thermodynamically unfavorable nanostructures with unconventional phases still remains a challenge. Here, the synthesis of hierarchical AuCu nanostructures is reported with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H&#8208;type)/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects (e.g., stacking faults, twin boundaries, and grain boundaries), and tunable Cu content. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets exhibit excellent performance for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO, outperforming the 2H/fcc Au91Cu9 and fcc Au99Cu1. The experimental results, especially those obtained by in&#8208;situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, suggest that the enhanced catalytic performance of 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 arises from the unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. Impressively, the 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 shows CO Faradaic efficiencies of 96.6% and 92.6% at industrial current densities of 300 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as good durability, placing it among the best CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for CO production. The atomically structural regulation based on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) provides an avenue for the rational design and preparation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various catalytic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8208;Free O3&#8208;Type Layered Oxyfluoride: A Promising Air&#8208;Stable Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A high&#8208;entropy approach is employed to design an advanced cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by combining elements of different traits to overcome the inhibitions of complex phase transition, inferior capacity, sluggish kinetics, and poor air stability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;based batteries, driven by an ever&#8208;growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;capacity cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, synthesized using a high&#8208;entropy approach. The high&#8208;entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long&#8208;term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is&#160;introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4&#160;V) and 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4.3&#160;V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high&#8208;entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high&#8208;entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Vaccine for Combating Fatal Bacterial Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and efficient vaccine adjuvant and carrier for the combating fatal bacterial pneumonia is reported based on STING activation through manganese ion and loading capacity of mesoporous silicate. Amino&#8208;decorated mesoporous manganese silicate nanoparticle loaded with rF1&#8208;V10 (rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN) confers complete protection to mice against aerosolized intratracheal challenge with a lethal dose of Yersinia pestis.








Abstract
Bacterial pneumonia is the leading cause of death worldwide among all infectious diseases. However, currently available vaccines against fatal bacterial lung infections, e.g., pneumonic plague, are accompanied by limitations, including insufficient antigen&#8208;adjuvant co&#8208;delivery and inadequate immune stimulation. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to develop next&#8208;generation vaccines to improve the interaction between antigen and adjuvant, as well as enhance the effects of immune stimulation. This study develops a novel amino&#8208;decorated mesoporous manganese silicate nanoparticle (AMMSN) loaded with rF1&#8208;V10 (rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN) to prevent pneumonic plague. These results suggest that subcutaneous immunization with rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN in a prime&#8208;boost strategy induces robust production of rF1&#8208;V10&#8208;specific IgG antibodies with a geometric mean titer of 315,844 at day 42 post&#8208;primary immunization, which confers complete protection to mice against 50 &#215; LD50 of Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) challenge via the aerosolized intratracheal route. Mechanistically, rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN can be taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promote DCs maturation through activation of the cyclic GMP&#8211;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and production of type I interferon. This process results in enhanced antigen presentation and promotes rF1&#8208;V10&#8208;mediated protection against Y. pestis infection. This manganese&#8208;based nanoparticle vaccine represents a valuable strategy for combating fatal bacterial pneumonia.

         <title>Extensible Integrated System for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Cardiovascular Physiological Signals and Limb Health</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensible integrated systems based on perovskite photodetector are very lightweight and have excellent shape adaptability, which not only can overcome the brittleness of rigid device, but also has good mechanical protection and electrical interconnection structure to adapt to disturbances caused by deformation. This work develops a promising approach for extracting pulse wave signals that can reflect human health status.








Abstract
In recent decades, the rapid growth in flexible materials, new manufacturing technologies, and wearable electronics design techniques has helped establish the foundations for noninvasive photoelectric sensing systems with shape&#8208;adaptability and &#8220;skin&#8208;like&#8221; properties. Physiological sensing includes humidity, mechanical, thermal, photoelectric, and other aspects. Photoplethysmography (PPG), an important noninvasive method for measuring pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen, uses the attenuated signal obtained by the light absorbed and reflected from living tissue to a light source to realize real&#8208;time monitoring of human health status. This work illustrates a patch&#8208;type optoelectronic system that integrates a flexible perovskite photodetector and all&#8208;inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) to realize the real&#8208;time monitoring of human PPG signals. The pulse rate of the human body and the swelling degree of finger joints can be extracted and analyzed using photodetectors, thus monitoring human health for the prevention and early diagnosis of certain diseases. Specifically, this work develops a 3D wrinkled&#8208;serpentine interconnection wire that increases the shape adaptability of the device in practical applications. The PPG signal sensor reported in this study has considerable potential for future wearable intelligent medical applications.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Liposomes Loaded with Monoclonal Antibodies Reduce Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation and Improve Behavioral Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>

The authors highlight a targeted drug delivery system for treating Parkinson's disease. By engineering brain&#8208;targeted liposomes with transferrin on the outer surface of the nanoparticles, and containing therapeutic antibodies, they achieve successful crossing of the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier and effective treatment of brain neurons. This approach reduces alpha&#8208;synuclein aggregation and neuroinflammation, showcasing its potential for delivering biologics in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold promise in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), although poor delivery to the brain hinders their therapeutic application. In the current study, it is demonstrated that brain&#8208;targeted liposomes (BTL) enhance the delivery of mAbs across the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and into neurons, thereby allowing the intracellular and extracellular treatment of the PD brain. BTL are decorated with transferrin to improve brain targeting through overexpressed transferrin&#8208;receptors on the BBB during PD. BTL are loaded with SynO4, a mAb that inhibits alpha&#8208;synuclein (AS) aggregation, a pathological hallmark of PD. It is shown that 100&#8208;nm BTL cross human BBB models intact and are taken up by primary neurons. Within neurons, SynO4 is released from the nanoparticles and bound to its target, thereby reducing AS aggregation, and enhancing neuronal viability. In vivo, intravenous BTL administration results in a sevenfold increase in mAbs in brain cells, decreasing AS aggregation and neuroinflammation. Treatment with BTL also improve behavioral motor function and learning ability in mice, with a favorable safety profile. Accordingly, targeted nanotechnologies offer a valuable platform for drug delivery to treat brain neurodegeneration.

         <title>Aqueous&#8208;Based Inorganic Colloidal Halide Perovskites Customizing Liquid Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of perovskite&#8208;mediated aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with the commercial scintillator AbLS is fabricated. PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their bright emission (photoluminescence quantum yield &gt; 90%), robust stability (100 days), robust radiation hardness (82.8 Gy), and conceptual potential applied in radiation detection from every angle of 360&#176;.








Abstract
Compared to solid scintillators and organic liquid scintillators, aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (AbLS) have more superiority in highly flexible scalability, yet are now limited by their low light yield (&#8776;100 photons MeV&#8722;1). Here, aqueous&#8208;based inorganic colloidal halide perovskites with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of three primary color luminescence up to 88.1% (red), 96% (green), and 81.8% (blue) are respectively synthesized, and a new generation of colloidal perovskite&#8208;mediated AbLS (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with the commercial scintillator AbLS is fabricated. This paper exhibits that the excellent PLQY and colloidal dispersion of halide perovskites benefit from poly(ethylene glycol) modification and this modification ensures the vacancy inhibition and formation of defect&#8211;free surfaces in an aqueous solution. Moreover, their high luminescent emission can be maintained for 100 days at low temperatures, and such modification also promises the heat&#8208;to&#8208;cold customization of operating temperature even in ice below 0 &#176;C. Finally, depending on the light yield of around 3058 and 8037 photons MeV&#8722;1 at room temperature and low temperature, PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their robust radiation hardness (dose rate as high as 23 mGy s&#8722;1) and conceptual application potential in high&#8208;energy ray radiation detection from every angle of 360&#176;.

         <title>3D Assembly of MXene Networks using a Ceramic Backbone with Controlled Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new material architecture where atomically thin 2D materials are arranged in 3D space within&#160;interconnected and open microscale pores of a freeze&#8208;cast porous ceramic backbone. This system allows large surfaces of the 2D materials to be exposed to the reactants, enabling new applications in energy storage, energy conversion, decarbonization, and steelmaking.








Transition metal carbides (MXenes) are novel 2D nanomaterials with exceptional properties, promising significant impact in applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and energy conversion. A major barrier preventing the widespread use of MXenes is the lack of methods for assembling MXene in 3D space without significant restacking, which degrades their performance. Here, this challenge is successfully overcome by introducing a novel material system: a 3D network of&#160;MXene formed on a porous ceramic backbone. The backbone dictates the network's 3D architecture while providing mechanical strength, gas/liquid permeability, and other beneficial properties. Freeze casting is used to fabricate a silica backbone with open pores and controlled porosity. Next, capilary flow is used to infiltrate MXene into the backbone from a dispersion. The system is then dried to conformally coat the pore walls with MXene, creating an interconnected 3D&#8208;MXene network. The fabrication approach is reproducible, and the MXene&#8208;infiltrated porous silica (MX&#8208;PS) system is highly conductive (e.g., 340 S m&#8722;1). The electrical conductivity of MX&#8208;PS is controlled by the porosity distribution, MXene concentration, and the number of infiltration cycles. Sandwich&#8208;type supercapacitors with MX&#8208;PS electrodes are shown to produce excellent areal capacitance (7.24 F cm&#8722;2) and energy density (0.32 mWh cm&#8722;2) with only 6% added MXene mass. This approach of creating 3D architectures of 2D nanomaterials will significantly impact many engineering applications.

         <title>Boosting Dye&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence by Enhanced Short&#8208;Range Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed to enhance the dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized upconversion emission by modifying the coordination sites on the conjugated structure of cyanine molecules. This strategy significantly improves the energy transfer efficiency between organic dyes and lanthanide ions Yb3+, and can be applied to both 808 and 730 nm dye&#8208;sensitization systems.








Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitization can enhance lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence, but is hindered by interfacial energy transfer from organic dye to lanthanide ion Yb3+. To overcome these limitations, modifying coordination sites on dye conjugated structures and minimizing the distance between fluorescence cores and Yb3+ in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are proposed. The specially designed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye, disulfo&#8208;indocyanine green (disulfo&#8208;ICG), acts as the antenna molecule and exhibits a 2413&#8208;fold increase in luminescence under 808&#160;nm excitation compared to UCNPs alone using 980&#160;nm irradiation. The significant improvement is attributed to the high energy transfer efficiency of 72.1% from disulfo&#8208;ICG to Yb3+ in UCNPs, with majority of energy originating from triplet state (T1) of disulfo&#8208;ICG. Shortening the distance between the dye and lanthanide ions increases the probability of energy transfer and strengthens the heavy atom effect, leading to enhanced T1 generation and improved dye&#8208;triplet sensitization upconversion. Importantly, this approach also applies to 730&#160;nm excitation Cy7&#8208;SO3 sensitization system, overcoming the spectral mismatch between Cy7 and Yb3+ and achieving a 52&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence. Furthermore, the enhancement of upconversion at single particle level through dye&#8208;sensitization is demonstrated. This strategy expands the range of NIR dyes for sensitization and opens new avenues for highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion systems.

         <title>A Mediator&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;Ply Biofuel Cell Using an Interfacial Assembly between Hydrophilic Enzymes and Hydrophobic Conductive Oxide Nanoparticles with Pointed Apexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a groundbreaking mediator&#8208;free hybrid biofuel cell that demonstrates exceptional performance is introduced. Through a multi&#8208;ply electrode design and an innovative assembly approach involving hydrophobic conductive oxide nanoparticles with distinct shapes and hydrophilic glucose oxidases, significant enhancements in power output and operation stability are achieved for cotton fiber&#8208;based biofuel cells.








Abstract
Biofuel cells (BFCs) based on enzymatic electrodes hold great promise as power sources for biomedical devices. However, their practical use is hindered by low electron transfer efficiency and poor operational stability of enzymatic electrodes. Here, a novel mediator&#8208;free multi&#8208;ply BFC that overcomes these limitations and exhibits both substantially high&#8208;power output and long&#8208;term operational stability is presented. The approach involves the utilization of interfacial interaction&#8208;induced assembly between hydrophilic glucose oxidase (GOx) and hydrophobic conductive indium tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) with distinctive shapes, along with a multi&#8208;ply electrode system. For the preparation of the anode, GOx and oleylamine&#8208;stabilized ITO NPs with bipod/tripod type are covalently assembled onto the host fiber electrode composed of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes and gold (Au)&#160;NPs. Remarkably, despite the contrasting hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, this interfacial assembly approach allows for the formation of nanoblended GOx/ITO NP film, enabling efficient electron transfer within the anode. Additionally, the cathode is prepared by sputtering Pt onto the host electrode. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;ply fiber electrode system exhibits unprecedented high&#8208;power output (&#8776;10.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and excellent operational stability (2.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, &#8776;49% after 60 days of continuous operation). The approach can provide a basis for the development of high&#8208;performance BFCs.

         <title>&#8220;Ice and Fire&#8221; Supramolecular Cell&#8208;Conjugation Drug Delivery Platform for Deep Tumor Ablation and Boosted Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ice cell &amp; fire nanomedicine&#8221; supramolecular cell conjugates are reported for combined photothermal/gas therapy/immunotherapy, allowing deep tumor tissue ablation and stimulation of immunity to suppress distant tumor and lung metastasis after only one treatment in vivo.








Abstract
Cancer recurrence and metastasis are two major challenges in the current clinical therapy. In this work, a novel diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based photothermal reagent (DCN) with unique J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced redshift is synthesized to achieve efficient tumor thermal ablation under safe power (0.33&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is co&#8208;loaded with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing DCN in amphiphilic polymers to realize heat&#8208;induced massive release of nitric oxide (NO), which can form oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) to active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby degrading the compact tumor extracellular matrix to improve the ablation depth and infiltration of immune cells. Through a facile supramolecular assembly method, the DCN/SNAP nanoparticles are anchored to liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;frozen cancer cells, achieving enhanced antitumor immune responses and effective inhibition of distant tumors and pulmonary metastases after only one treatment. The safety and effectiveness of this supramolecular cell&#8208;conjugation platform are verified by 2D/3D cellular experiments and bilateral tumor model, confirming the thermal&#8208;ablation&#8211;gas&#8208;permeation&#8211;antigen&#8208;presentation therapeutic mode has promising anticancer prospects.

         <title>Engineering the Intrinsic Chirality of Plasmonic Au@Pd Metamaterials for Highly Sensitive Chiroplasmonic Hydrogen Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the chiroplasmonic properties of helicoid Au nanoparticles and the sensing capability of Pd, helicoid Au@Pd nanoparticles with intrinsic chirality are constructed as metamaterials for chiroplasmonic hydrogen sensing. The helicoid Au@Pd nanoparticles display an unprecedented sensitivity exceeding all plasmonic hydrogen sensors in the visible range, as evidenced by substantial circular dichroism red&#8208;shift up to 206.1&#160;nm upon hydrogen uptake.








Abstract
Metal helicoid nanoparticles with intrinsic 3D chiral structures have emerged as a new class of plasmonic metamaterials with outstanding chiroplasmonic properties. Despite the considerable potential of metal helicoid nanoparticles in chiroplasmonic sensing, their sensing capabilities remain elusive, stressing the need for the rational chirality engineering of helicoid nanoparticles. In this report, Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles with engineered chiroplasmonic properties and integrated hydrogen sensing capabilities are rationally synthesized. As chiroplasmonic metamaterials, the Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity for hydrogen chiroplasmonic sensing in the visible range. A significant circular dichroism red&#8208;shift as large as 206.1&#160;nm can be achieved when they are exposed to hydrogen. Such a high sensitivity outperforms all the plasmonic hydrogen sensors in the visible range. Besides sensitivity, the chiroplasmonic sensing platform shows a good linear range of 1.5&#8211;6.0% hydrogen concentration with higher figure of merit, excellent selectivity, and good reusability. To further demonstrate its applicability, this chiroplasmonic hydrogen sensing platform is utilized to investigate hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics on Pd. This study heralds a new paradigm for plasmonic hydrogen sensing and highlights the tremendous potential of utilizing helicoid nanoparticles as chiroplasmonic sensing metamaterials by chirality engineering.

         <title>Engineered Hierarchical Microdevices Enable Pre&#8208;Programmed Controlled Release for Postsurgical and Unresectable Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfabrication concept, termed &#8220;Hierarchical Multiple Polymers Immobilization&#8221; (HMPI), is proposed to fabricate surface&#8208;erodible hierarchical microdevices, which enable any desired controlled release profile in situ in tumor beds according to clinical medication schedules. Specifically, hierarchical microdevices are tailored to implement multiple courses of single&#8208;drug and multi&#8208;drug controlled release and demonstrate promising alternative options for postsurgical and unresectable tumor control.








Abstract
Drug treatment is required for both resectable and unresectable cancers to strive for any meaningful improvement in&#160;patient outcomes. However, the clinical benefit of receiving conventional systemic administrations is often less than satisfactory. Drug delivery systems are preferable substitutes but still fail to meet diverse clinical demands due to the difficulty in programming drug release profiles. Herein, a microfabrication concept, termed &#8220;Hierarchical Multiple Polymers Immobilization&#8221; (HMPI), is introduced and biodegradable&#8208;polymer&#8208;based hierarchical microdevices (HMDs) that can pre&#8208;program any desired controlled release profiles are engineered. Based on the first&#8208;line medication of pancreatic and breast cancer, controlled release of single gemcitabine and the doxorubicin/paclitaxel combination in situ for multiple courses is implemented, respectively. Preclinical models of postsurgical pancreatic, postsurgical breast, and unresectable breast cancer are established, and the designed HMDs are demonstrated as well&#8208;tolerable and effective treatments for inhibiting tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis. The proposed HMPI strategy allows the creation of tailorable and high&#8208;resolution hierarchical microstructures for pre&#8208;programming controlled release according to clinical medication schedules, which may provide promising alternative treatments for postsurgical and unresectable tumor control.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Liquid&#8208;Repellent and Thermal&#8211;Wet Comfortable Membranes Using Triboelectric Nanostructured Nanofiber/Meshes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust strategy to synthesize an antisymmetric wetting nanoarchitectured meshwork via a novel electromeshing technique is reported. By combining the true nanoscale diameter (&#8776;22&#160;nm), small pore size, and high porosity, both high waterproofness and breathability for the membranes are achieved. Moreover, integration of hydrophilic wicking and triboelectric field polarization endows the materials with satisfactory water evaporation rate (0.64&#160;g h&#8722;1).








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like functional membranes with liquid resistance and moisture permeability are in growing demand in various applications. However, the membranes have been facing a long&#8208;term dilemma in balancing waterproofness and breathability, as well as resisting internal liquid sweat transport, resulting in poor thermal&#8211;wet comfort.

Moreover, the membranes can break large water clusters into small water molecules to promote sweat absorption and release by coupling hydrophilic wicking and triboelectric field polarization, exhibiting a satisfactory water evaporation rate (0.64&#160;g h&#8722;1) and thermal&#8211;wet comfort (0.7&#160;&#176;C cooler than the cutting&#8208;edge poly(tetrafluoroethylene) protective membranes).

&lt;p&gt;A robust strategy to synthesize an antisymmetric wetting nanoarchitectured meshwork via a novel electromeshing technique is reported. By combining the true nanoscale diameter (&#8776;22&#160;nm), small pore size, and high porosity, both high waterproofness and breathability for the membranes are achieved. Moreover, integration of hydrophilic wicking and triboelectric field polarization endows the materials with satisfactory water evaporation rate (0.64&#160;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Chirality Versus Symmetry: Electron's Spin Selectivity in Nonpolar Chiral Lead&#8211;Bromide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D chiral halide perovskites crystallizing in nonpolar enantiomorphic space groups present incomplete Rashba&#8208;like splittings of the bottom conduction and top valence bands, resulting in rare spin textures and chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. The electron's spin polarization in these stable thin films allows the fabrication of chiro&#8208;spintronic devices such as spin valves.








Abstract
In the last decade, chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the spin&#8208;selective electron transport through chiral molecules, has been described in a large range of materials, from insulators to superconductors. Because more experimental studies are desired for the theoretical understanding of the CISS effect, chiral metal&#8208;halide semiconductors may contribute to the field thanks to their chiroptical and spintronic properties. In this regard, this work uses new chiral organic cations S&#8208;HP1A and R&#8208;HP1A (HP1A = 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;propyl&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium) to prepare 2D chiral halide perovskites (HPs) which crystallize in the enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The fourfold symmetry induces antiferroelectricity along the stacking axis which, combined to incomplete Rashba&#8208;like splitting in each individual 2D polar layer, results in rare spin textures in the band structure. As revealed by magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, these materials show CISS effect with partial spin polarization (SP; &#177;40&#8211;45%). This incomplete effect is efficient enough to drive a chiro&#8208;spintronic device as demonstrated by the fabrication of spin valve devices with magnetoresistance (MR) responses up to 250 K. Therefore, these stable lead&#8211;bromide HP materials not only represent interesting candidates for spintronic applications but also reveal the importance of polar symmetry&#8208;breaking topology for spin selectivity.

         <title>Interlocking&#8208;Governed Ultra&#8208;Strong and Highly Conductive MXene Fibers Through Fluidics&#8208;Assisted Thermal Drawing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluidics&#8208;assisted thermal drawing stresses reduce the voids and align the MXene (Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx) nanosheets to directly achieve ultra&#8208;strong and highly conductive MXene fiber with tablet interfacial interlocks. Indeed, the interlocking&#8208;governed interfacial interaction significantly enhances the fundamental understanding of nanoscale material engineering.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance MXene fibers are always of significant interest for flexible textile&#8208;based devices. However, achieving high mechanical property and electrical conductivity remains challenging due to the uncontrolled loose microstructures of MXene (Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx) nanosheets. Herein, high&#8208;performance MXene fibers directly obtained through fluidics&#8208;assisted thermal drawing are demonstrated. Tablet interlocks are formed at the interface layer between the outer cyclic olefin copolymer and inner MXene nanosheets due to the thermal drawing induced stresses, resulting in thousands of meters long macroscopic compact MXene fibers with ultra&#8208;high tensile strength, toughness, and outstanding electrical conductivity. Further, large&#8208;scale woven textiles constructed by these fibers offer exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance with excellent durability and stability. Such an effective and sustainable approach can be applied to produce functional fibers for applications in both daily life and aerospace.

         <title>Scalable Electrodeposition of Liquid Metal from an Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Highly Integrated Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) is an attractive conductor for stretchable electronics but its high surface tension makes sub&#8208;micrometer patterning challenging. This limitation is overcome by electrodeposition, a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach that benefits from the resolution of mature nanofabrication methods. A record&#8208;high integration of EGaIn lines of 300 nm half&#8208;pitch is achieved. Moreover, vertical integration is enabled, leading to omnidirectionally stretchable 3D electronics.








Abstract
The advancement of highly integrated stretchable electronics requires the development of scalable sub&#8208;micrometer conductor patterning. Eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) is an attractive conductor for stretchable electronics, as its liquid metallic character grants it high electrical conductivity upon deformation. However, its high surface tension makes its patterning with sub&#8208;micrometer resolution challenging. In this work, this limitation is overcome by way of&#160;the electrodeposition of EGaIn. A non&#8208;aqueous acetonitrile&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high electrochemical stability and chemical orthogonality is used. The electrodeposited material leads to low&#8208;resistance lines that remain stable upon (repeated) stretching to a 100% strain. Because electrodeposition benefits from the resolution of mature nanofabrication methods used to pattern the base metal, the proposed &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach achieves a record&#8208;high density integration of EGaIn regular lines of 300&#160;nm half&#8208;pitch on an elastomer substrate by plating on a gold seed layer prepatterned by nanoimprinting. Moreover, vertical integration is enabled by filling high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio vias. This capability is conceptualized by the fabrication of an omnidirectionally stretchable 3D electronic circuit, and demonstrates a soft&#8208;electronic analog of the stablished damascene process used to fabricate microchip interconnects. Overall, this work proposes a simple route to address the challenge of metallization in highly integrated (3D) stretchable electronics.

         <title>A Counterion&#8208;Free Strategy for Chronic Metabolic Acidosis Based on an Orally Administered Gut&#8208;Restricted Inorganic Adsorbent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABC&#8208;350, an orally&#8208;administered gut&#8208;restricted adsorbent, is derived from bismuth subcarbonate annealing. It selectively adsorbs H+ and Cl&#8722; in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting HCO3&#8722; release into circulation to alleviate metabolic acidosis. This effect also delays renal damage, highlighting the potential for improved treatment outcomes.








Abstract
Chronic metabolic acidosis, arising as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), not only reduces patients&#8217; quality of life but also aggravates renal impairment. The only available therapeutic modality, involving intravenous infusion of NaHCO3, engenders undesirable sodium retention, thereby increasing hemodynamic load and seriously exacerbating the primary disease. This deleterious cascade extends to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, an orally administered, gut&#8208;restricted inorganic adsorbent that can effectively alleviate chronic metabolic acidosis without causing any electrolytic derangement or superfluous cardiovascular strain is developed. The genesis of ABC&#8208;350 entails the engineering of bismuth subcarbonate via annealing, thereby yielding a partially &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;doped (BiO)2CO3 biphasic crystalline structure framework enriched with atomic vacancies. ABC&#8208;350 can selectively remove chloride ions and protons from the gastrointestinal tract, mimicking the physiological response to gastric acid removal and resulting in increased serum bicarbonate. Owing to its gut&#8208;restricted nature, ABC&#8208;350 exhibits commendable biosafety, averting undue systemic exposure. In two rat models of metabolic acidosis, ABC&#8208;350 emerges not only as a potent mitigator of acidosis but also effects discernible amelioration concerning proximal tubular morphology, interstitial fibrosis, and the incendiary cascades incited by metabolic acidosis.

&lt;p&gt;ABC-350, an orally-administered gut-restricted adsorbent, is derived from bismuth subcarbonate annealing. It selectively adsorbs H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; release into circulation to alleviate metabolic acidosis. This effect also delays renal damage, highlighting the potential for improved treatment outcomes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic metabolic acidosis, arising as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), not only reduces patients&#8217; quality of life but also aggravates renal impairment. The only available therapeutic modality, involving intravenous infusion of NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, engenders undesirable sodium retention, thereby increasing hemodynamic load and seriously exacerbating the primary disease. This deleterious cascade extends to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, an orally administered, gut-restricted inorganic adsorbent that can effectively alleviate chronic metabolic acidosis without causing any electrolytic derangement or superfluous cardiovascular strain is developed. The genesis of ABC-350 entails the engineering of bismuth subcarbonate via annealing, thereby yielding a partially &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-doped (BiO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; biphasic crystalline structure framework enriched with atomic vacancies. ABC-350 can selectively remove chloride ions and protons from the gastrointestinal tract, mimicking the physiological response to gastric acid removal and resulting in increased serum bicarbonate. Owing to its gut-restricted nature, ABC-350 exhibits commendable biosafety, averting undue systemic exposure. In two rat models of metabolic acidosis, ABC-350 emerges not only as a potent mitigator of acidosis but also effects discernible amelioration concerning proximal tubular morphology, interstitial fibrosis, and the incendiary cascades incited by metabolic acidosis. ABC-350, as the translationally relevant material, provides a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microelectronic Morphogenesis: Smart Materials with Electronics Assembling into Artificial Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microelectronic morphogenesis, the creation and maintenance of complex functional structures by microelectronic information within shape&#8208;changing materials, is making large strides toward artificial electronic organisms. The fundamental breakthroughs that enable inheritable electronic information to control morphology and acquire self&#8208;awareness as well as sustainable energy and material autonomy are reviewed.








Abstract
Microelectronic morphogenesis is the creation and maintenance of complex functional structures by microelectronic information within shape&#8208;changing materials. Only recently has in&#8208;built information technology begun to be used to reshape materials and their functions in three dimensions to form smart microdevices and microrobots. Electronic information that controls morphology is inheritable like its biological counterpart, genetic information, and is set to open new vistas of technology leading to artificial organisms when coupled with modular design and self&#8208;assembly that can make reversible microscopic electrical connections. Three core capabilities of cells in organisms, self&#8208;maintenance (homeostatic metabolism utilizing free energy), self&#8208;containment (distinguishing self from nonself), and self&#8208;reproduction (cell division with inherited properties), once well out of reach for technology, are now within the grasp of information&#8208;directed materials. Construction&#8208;aware electronics can be used to proof&#8208;read and initiate game&#8208;changing error correction in microelectronic self&#8208;assembly. Furthermore, noncontact communication and electronically supported learning enable one to implement guided self&#8208;assembly and enhance functionality. Here, the fundamental breakthroughs that have opened the pathway to this prospective path are reviewed, the extent and way in which the core properties of life can be addressed are analyzed, and the potential and indeed necessity of such technology for sustainable high technology in society is discussed.

         <title>Over&#8208;Stoichiometric Metastabilization of Cation&#8208;Disordered Rock Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over&#8208;stoichiometric metastabilization of cation&#8208;disordered rock salts allows relaxation of the site balance constraint of rock salt structures. It stimulates more unlocked redox activity, induces more cation disordering, and changes the energy storage mechanisms. The route can greatly expand the synthesizable chemical space of cation disorder rock salts and allows new opportunities to explore higher electrochemical performance within the chemical space.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rock salts (DRXs) are well known for their potential to realize the goal of achieving scalable Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;free high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries. Unlike in most cathode materials, the disordered cation distribution may lead to more factors that control the electrochemistry of DRXs. An important variable that is not emphasized by research community is regarding whether a DRX exists in a more thermodynamically stable form or a more metastable form. Moreover, within the scope of metastable DRXs, over&#8208;stoichiometric DRXs, which allow relaxation of the site balance constraint of a rock salt structure, are particularly underexplored. In this work, these findings are reported in locating a generally applicable approach to &#8220;metastabilize&#8221; thermodynamically stable Mn&#8208;based DRXs to metastable ones by introducing Li over&#8208;stoichiometry. The over&#8208;stoichiometric metastabilization greatly stimulates more redox activities, enables better reversibility of Li deintercalation/intercalation, and changes the energy storage mechanism. The metastabilized DRXs can be transformed back to the thermodynamically stable form, which also reverts the electrochemical properties, further contrasting the two categories of DRXs. This work enriches the structural and compositional space of DRX families and adds new pathways for rationally tuning the properties of DRX cathodes.

         <title>Direct Operando Visualization of Metal Support Interactions Induced by Hydrogen Spillover During CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando electron energy loss spectroscopy in combination with a windowed gas cell and mass spectrometer is used to detect the dynamic formation of Ce3+ active sites within a Ni/CeO2 catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation. The detection of localized active site formation surrounding the Ni nanoparticles highlights the role that interfacial metal&#8211;support interactions play in preferencing reaction pathways.








Abstract
The understanding of catalyst active sites is a fundamental challenge for the future rational design of optimized and bespoke catalysts. For instance, the partial reduction of Ce4+ surface sites to Ce3+ and the formation of oxygen vacancies are critical for CO2 hydrogenation, CO oxidation, and the water gas shift reaction. Furthermore, metal nanoparticles, the reducible support, and metal support interactions are prone to evolve under reaction conditions; therefore a catalyst structure must be characterized under operando conditions to identify active states and deduce structure&#8208;activity relationships. In the present work, temperature&#8208;induced morphological and chemical changes in Ni nanoparticle&#8208;decorated mesoporous CeO2 by means of in situ quantitative multimode electron tomography and in situ heating electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively,&#160;are investigated. Moreover, operando electron energy loss spectroscopy is employed using a windowed gas cell&#160;and reveals the role of Ni&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover on active Ce3+ site formation and enhancement of the overall catalytic performance.

         <title>Organic Bilayer Heterostructures with Built&#8208;In Exciton Conversion for 2D Photonic Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial growth process, a stepwise seeded growth strategy for precise synthesis of organic bilayer heterostructures with tailored heterojunction surface areas is demonstrated. Furthermore, the relative position and length ratio of component microwires can be finely modulated by controlling the crystallization time of seeded crystals. Notably, these prepared organic heterostructures can be applied in two&#8208;dimensional photonic encryption.








Abstract
Organic multilayer heterostructures with accurate spatial organization demonstrate strong light&#8208;matter interaction from excitonic responses and efficient carrier transfer across heterojunction interfaces, which are considered as promising candidates toward advanced optoelectronics. However, the precise regulation of the heterojunction surface area for finely adjusting exciton conversion and energy transfer is still formidable. Herein, organic bilayer heterostructures (OBHs) with controlled face&#8208;to&#8208;face heterojunction via a stepwise seeded growth strategy, which is favorable for efficient exciton propagation and conversion of optical interconnects are designed and synthesized. Notably, the relative position and overlap length ratio of component microwires (LDSA/LBPEA = 0.39&#8211;1.15) in OBHs are accurately regulated by modulating the crystallization time of seeded crystals, resulting into a tailored heterojunction surface area (R = Loverlap/LBPEA = 37.6%&#8211;65.3%). These as&#8208;prepared OBHs present the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide behaviors for optical outcoupling characteristics with tunable emission colors and intensities, which are applied into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) photonic barcodes. This strategy opens a versatile avenue to purposely design OBHs with tailored heterojunctions for efficient energy transfer and exciton conversion, facilitating the application possibilities of advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>N&#8208;Methylquinuclidinium&#8208;Based Anion Exchange Membrane with Ultrahigh Alkaline Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance AEM based on a new cationic group, N&#8208;methylquinuclidinium, is prepared, which shows ultrahigh alkaline stability and dimensional stability in highly concentrated alkaline solution and at high temperature. A prototype water electrolyzer by sandwiching this AEM between two nickel&#8208;alloy electrodes exhibits superior current density (1.94&#160;A&#160;m&#8722;2) at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;m KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. However, the bottleneck of its development is the poor comprehensive performance of AEM, especially the stability at highly concentrated alkaline condition and temperature. Herein, a new cationic group N&#8208;methylquinuclidinium with enhanced alkaline stability is proposed and hereby a full&#8208;carbon chain poly(aryl quinuclidinium) AEM is prepared. Compared with reported AEMs, it shows ultrahigh comprehensive alkaline stability (no chemical decomposition, no decay of conductivity) in 10&#160;m NaOH aqueous solution at 80&#160;&#176;C for more than 1800&#160;h, excellent dimensional stability (swelling ratio: &lt;10% in pure water, &lt;2% in 10&#160;m NaOH) in OH&#8722; form at 80&#160;&#176;C, high OH&#8722; conductivity (&#8776;139.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#160;&#176;C), and high mechanical properties (tensile strength: 41.5&#160;MPa, elongation at break: 50%). The water electrolyzer using the AEM exhibits a high current density (1.94&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V) when assembled with nickel&#8208;alloy foam electrodes, and high durability when assembled with nickel foam electrodes.

         <title>Can We See SEI Directly by&#160;Naked Eyes?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film can be seen directly by&#160;naked eyes based on its intrinsic fluorescence signal, obtained by fluorescent tracers acting as SEI film&#8208;forming additives for electrolytes. This shining SEI allows direct observation and quantification of the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI and reveals SEI formation growth destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles, enriching the knowledge and understanding of SEI.








Abstract
Stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, there are still many puzzles about SEI film that have not been well explained, due to the complexity of electrochemical reactions involving in SEI formation and the absence of direct observation methods for SEI. Here, this work realizes the direct observation of SEI by skillfully designed fluorescent tracers acting as an SEI film&#8208;forming additive for electrolytes. These fluorescent tracers have three important moieties: an olefin group for polymerization on anode surface so as to participate in SEI film formation during charge/discharge cycles, a polar group for Li&#8208;ion conduction, and an AIEgen for fluorescent tracing. Therefore, the tracers participate in SEI film&#8208;forming and result in a shining SEI film. This shining SEI film with intrinsic fluorescence signal allows direct observation and quantification on the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI. These fluorescent tracers can also reveal the SEI formation growth destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles. Several summarized typical macro morphologies and evolution stages of SEI will enrich knowledge and understanding of SEI and help to gain insight into the interaction between electrolyte and anode, electrochemical performance, and cycle life of batteries.

         <title>Mesostructured Materials with Controllable Long&#8208;Range Orientational Ordering and Anisotropic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High and controllable degrees of macroscopic orientational ordering are demonstrated for mesostructured silica, titania, and carbon films. Judicious selection of synthesis conditions enables the control of the directions and relative rates of solvent removal, surfactant self&#8208;assembly, inorganic&#8208;oxide cross&#8208;linking, and the surfaces at which mesophases grow. The materials exhibit anisotropic properties for applications in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic mesophase materials provide a wide range of tunable properties, which are often highly dependent on their nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, or meso&#8208;scale compositions and structures. Among these are macroscopic orientational order and corresponding anisotropic material properties, the adjustability of which are difficult to achieve. This is due to the complicated transient and coupled transport, chemical reaction, and surface processes that occur during material syntheses. By understanding such processes, general criteria are established and used to prepare diverse mesostructured materials with highly aligned channels with uniform nanometer dimensions and controllable directionalities over macroscopic dimensions and thicknesses. This is achieved by using a micropatterned semipermeable poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp to manage the rates, directions, and surfaces at which self&#8208;assembling phases nucleate and the directions that they grow. This enables mesostructured surfactant&#8208;directed silica and titania composites, including with functional guest species, and mesoporous carbons to be prepared with high degrees of hexagonal order, as well as controllable orthogonal macroscopic orientational order. The resulting materials exhibit novel anisotropic properties, as demonstrated by the example of direction&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation, and are promising for enhancing the functionality of inorganic&#8211;organic nanocomposite materials in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Engineering Atomic&#8208;Scale Patterning and Resistive Switching in 2D Crystals and Application in Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning design provides extra degrees of freedom to realize tailored material properties and device functionality. This research demonstrates that scalable atomic&#8208;scale patterning and controllable resistive switching can be realized in 2D superionic cuprous telluride by using the bonding difference at nonequivalent sites, and proposes a compact model for mimicking the memristor dynamics that can be used for image processing.








Abstract
The ultrathin thickness of 2D layered materials affords the control of their properties through defects, surface modification, and electrostatic fields more efficiently compared with bulk architecture. In particular, patterning design, such as moir&#233; superlattice patterns and spatially periodic dielectric structures, are demonstrated to possess the ability to precisely control the local atomic and electronic environment at large scale, thus providing extra degrees of freedom to realize tailored material properties and device functionality. Here,&#160;the scalable atomic&#8208;scale patterning in superionic cuprous telluride by using the bonding difference at nonequivalent copper sites is reported. Moreover, benefitting from the natural coupling of ordered and disordered sublattices,&#160;controllable piezoelectricity&#8208;like multilevel switching and bipolar switching with the designed crystal structure and electrical contact is realized, and their application in image enhancement is demonstrated. This work extends the known classes of patternable crystals and atomic switching devices, and ushers in a frontier for image processing with memristors.

The optimized CuI thin film transistors show high hole mobility of 21.6 &#177; 4.5&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and successfully operate indium gallium zinc oxide&#8208;CuI complementary logic gates, demonstrating the device's applicability.








Abstract
Development of a novel high performing inorganic p&#8208;type thin film transistor could pave the way for new transparent electronic devices. This complements the widely commercialized n&#8208;type counterparts, indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO). Of the few potential candidates, copper monoiodide (CuI) stands out. It boasts visible light transparency and high intrinsic hole mobility (&gt;40 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and is suitable for various low&#8208;temperature processes. However, the performance of reported CuI transistors is still below expected mobility, mainly due to the uncontrolled excess charge&#8208; and defect&#8208;scattering from thermodynamically favored formation of copper and iodine vacancies. Here, a solution&#8208;processed CuI transistor with a significantly improved mobility is reported. This enhancement is achieved through a room&#8208;temperature vacancy&#8208;engineering processing strategy on high&#8208;k dielectrics, sodium&#8208;embedded alumina. A thorough set of chemical, structural, optical, and electrical analyses elucidates the processing&#8208;dependent vacancy&#8208;modulation and its corresponding transport mechanism in CuI. This encompasses defect&#8208; and phonon&#8208;scattering, as well as the delocalization of charges in crystalline domains. As a result, the optimized CuI thin film transistors exhibit exceptionally high hole mobility of 21.6 &#177; 4.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Further, the successful operation of IGZO&#8208;CuI complementary logic gates confirms the applicability of the device.

         <title>Central Core Substitutions and Film&#8208;Formation Process Optimization Enable Approaching 19% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel polymer acceptors based on quinoxaline units are synthesized. Central core substitutions are modified and achieve systemic adjustment of aggregation ability and interaction with polymer donor PM6, leading to different film&#8208;formation processes. As a result, PM6:PQx3&#8208;based devices deliver high power conversion efficiencies (18.06%, one of the highest values for binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells), excellent film&#8208;thickness tolerance, and superior stability.








Abstract
Molecular interactions and film&#8208;formation processes greatly impact the blend film morphology and device performances of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Molecular structure, such as the central cores of polymer acceptors, would significantly influence this process. Herein, the central core substitutions of polymer acceptors are adjusted and three quinoxaline (Qx)&#8208;fused&#8208;core&#8208;based materials, PQx1, PQx2, and PQx3 are synthesized. The molecular aggregation ability and intermolecular interaction are systematically regulated, which subsequently influence the film&#8208;formation process and determine the resulting blend film morphology. As a result, PQx3, with favorable aggregation ability and moderate interaction with polymer donor PM6, achieves efficient all&#8208;PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60%, which could be further improved to 18.06% after carefully optimizing device annealing and interface layer. This impressive PCE is one of the highest values for binary all&#8208;PSCs based on the classical polymer donor PM6. PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o is also involved in promoting light utilization, and the resulting ternary device shows an impressive PCE of 18.82%. In addition, PM6:PQx3&#8208;based devices exhibit high film&#8208;thickness tolerance, superior stability, and considerable potential for large&#8208;scale devices (16.23% in 1 cm2 device). These results highlight the importance of structure optimization of polymer acceptors and film&#8208;formation process control for obtaining efficient and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Silica Anode Achieving Intrinsic Zero&#8208;Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle of intrinsic zero&#8208;strain anodes (&#9312; large intracrystalline cavities and &#9313; strong bonds) is proposed, and silica with large intracrystalline cavities established by strong Si&#9472;O bonds ([SiO4] coordinate structures) is obtained achieving the intrinsic zero&#8208;strain feature first in silicon&#8208;based anodes and exhibiting high performance. The mechanism also is revealed.








Abstract
Si&#8208;based anodes have large intrinsic volume expansion, which hinders their practicality and commercialization. To address this challenge, the design principle of intrinsic zero&#8208;strain anodes (&#9312; large intracrystalline cavities and &#9313; strong bonds) is proposed, and silica with large intracrystalline cavities (SLIC) established by strong Si&#9472;O bonds ([SiO4] coordinate structures) is obtained and acts as an anode, achieving the intrinsic zero&#8208;strain feature first in silicon&#8208;based anodes. The phase structure of SLIC is maintained and the [SiO4] coordinate structure merely shows slight disorder during cycling. The feature stems from lithiation taking place by the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction rather than the conventional conversion/alloying addition reactions, because the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction for the SLIC has the lowest change in the Gibbs free energy. The SLIC anode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high initial Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;85%). Moreover, owing to the low working voltage (&#8776;0.28&#160;V) and relatively high specific capacity, the SLIC anode presents the highest gravimetric energy density among reported zero&#8208;/quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain anodes and high volumetric energy density (around twice as much as graphite). The universality of the designing principle is also validated. This work provides design guidelines for zero&#8208;strain anodes in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Healable Ionic Conductors with Extremely Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High Mechanical Strength Enabled by Hydrophobic Domain&#8208;Locked Reversible Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversibly cross&#8208;linked stretchable ionic conductors with extremely low&#8208;hysteresis, high mechanical strength, and toughness are fabricated by locking noncovalent interactions within hydrophobic domains. The ionic conductor can maintain its original strength and elasticity during 5000 cycles of uninterrupted loading&#8211;unloading tests at 200% strain. The fractured ionic conductors can be conveniently healed to restore their original mechanical properties and conductivity.








Abstract
Extremely low hysteresis, high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and excellent healability are essential for stretchable ionic conductors to enhance their reliability and meet for cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the fabrication of stretchable ionic conductors with such mutually exclusive properties remains challenging. Herein, extremely low&#8208;hysteresis and healable ionic conductors with a tensile strength of &#8776;8.9&#160;MPa and toughness of &#8776;23.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 are fabricated through the complexation of 4&#8208;carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (denoted as PVA&#8208;CBA) and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) followed by acidification and ion&#8208;loading steps. The acidification step generates the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors with in situ formed dynamic hydrophobic domains that lock and stabilize noncovalent interactions. This significantly minimizes the energy dissipation of the ionic conductors during cyclic mechanical loading (&#8804;200% strain), resulting in ionic conductors with extremely low hysteresis (&#8776;5%). The fractured ionic conductors can be healed at 60&#160;&#176;C to restore their original properties. Because of the extremely low hysteresis, the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors show a highly stable and reproducible electrical response over 5000 uninterrupted loading&#8211;unloading cycles at a strain of 200%. The ionic conductor based sensors exhibit a high sensitivity to a wide range of strains (1&#8211;500%).

         <title>Universal Polarization Transformations: Spatial Programming of Polarization Scattering Matrices Using a Deep Learning&#8208;Designed Diffractive Polarization Transformer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal polarization transformer based on a structured diffractive volume optimized using deep learning can synthesize a large set of arbitrarily&#8208;selected, complex&#8208;valued polarization scattering matrices between its input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view. This universal polarization transformation framework is experimentally validated in the terahertz spectrum by fabricating wire&#8208;grid polarizers and integrating them with 3D&#8208;printed diffractive layers to form a physical polarization transformer.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of optical fields having nonuniform polarization distributions presents a challenging task. Here, a universal polarization transformer is demonstrated that can synthesize a large set of arbitrarily&#8208;selected, complex&#8208;valued polarization scattering matrices between the polarization states at different positions within its input and output field&#8208;of&#8208;views (FOVs). This framework comprises 2D arrays of linear polarizers positioned between isotropic diffractive layers, each containing tens of thousands of diffractive features with optimizable transmission coefficients.

This universal polarization transformation framework is experimentally validated in the terahertz spectrum by fabricating wire&#8208;grid polarizers and integrating them with 3D&#8208;printed diffractive layers to form a physical polarization transformer.

This framework opens up new avenues for developing novel devices for universal polarization control and may find applications in, e.g., remote sensing, medical imaging, security, material inspection, and machine vision.

         <title>Molecular Imprinting Technology Enables Proactive Capture of Nitrogen for Boosted Ammonia Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular imprinting technology is adopted to construct an adlayer with abundant nitrogen imprints on the electrocatalyst to selectively recognize and proactively aggregate high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen at the interface while hindering access to overwhelming water simultaneously. Threefold improvements in both ammonia production rate and Faradaic efficiency are achieved by a metal&#8208;free catalyst compared with the bare one.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a burgeoning field for green and sustainable ammonia production, in which numerous potential catalysts emerge endlessly. However, satisfactory performances are still not realized under practical applications due to the limited solubility and sluggish diffusion of nitrogen at the interface. Herein, molecular imprinting technology is adopted to construct an adlayer with abundant nitrogen imprints on the electrocatalyst, which is capable of selectively recognizing and proactively aggregating high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen at the interface while hindering the access of overwhelming water simultaneously. With this favorable microenvironment, nitrogen can preferentially occupy the active surface, and the NRR equilibrium can be positively shifted to facilitate the reaction kinetics. Approximately threefold improvements in both ammonia production rate (185.7&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (72.9%) are achieved by a metal&#8208;free catalyst compared with the bare one. It is believed that the molecular imprinting strategy should be a general method to find further applicability in numerous catalysts or even other reactions facing similar challenges.

         <title>Nonflammable Polyfluorides&#8208;Anchored Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Safe Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Pouch Cells without Thermal Runaway</title>

         <dc:description>
The present work proposes a flame&#8208;retardant polyfluorinated hexafluorobutyl acrylate (HFBA) as the monomer for implementing an in situ radical polymerization with pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) crosslinker to convert the liquid electrolyte into a quasi&#8208;solid system. The as&#8208;constructed quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte eliminates the intrinsic flammability due to the synergistic gas&#8208;phase radical scavenging effect of HFBA and the condensed&#8208;phase flame&#8208;retardant effect of PETEA.








Abstract
The safe operation of rechargeable batteries is crucial because of numerous instances of fire and explosion mishaps. However, battery chemistry involving metallic lithium (Li) as the anode is prone to thermal runaway in flammable organic electrolytes under abusive conditions. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is proposed to construct nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes through the radical polymerization of a hexafluorobutyl acrylate (HFBA) monomer and a pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) crosslinker. The quasi&#8208;solid system eliminates the inherent flammability of ether electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time owing to the gas&#8208;phase radical capturing ability of HFBA. Additionally, the graphitized carbon layer generated during the decomposition of PETEA at high temperatures obstructs the heat and oxygen required for combustion. When coupled with Au&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide anodic current collectors and lithium sulfide cathodes, the assembled anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal cell based on the quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte exhibits no signs of cell expansion or gas generation during cycling, and thermal runaway is eliminated under multiple mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse scenarios and even rigorous strikes. This nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid configuration with gas&#8208; and condensed&#8208;phase flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms can drive a technological leap in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal pouch cells and secure the practical applications necessary to power this society in a safe manner.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Charged Defects with Multiple Active Sited Macrocyclic Valinomycin for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a macrocyclic material valinomycin (VM) with multiple &#9472;C&#9552;O, &#9472;NH, and &#9472;O&#9472; groups is utilized to manage charged defects by passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ and compensating formamidine vacancy at perovskite surface. VM modification also induces a favorable energy band bending. These advances boost the power conversion efficiency from 21.97% to 24.06% for inverted perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The unavoidably positively and negatively charged defects at the interface between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) often lead to severe surface recombination and unfavorable energy level alignment in inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Inserting interlayers at this interface is an effective approach to eliminate charged defects. Herein, the macrocyclic molecule valinomycin (VM) with multiple active sites of &#9472;C&#9552;O, &#9472;NH, and &#9472;O&#9472; is employed as an interlayer at the perovskite/ETL contact to simultaneously eliminate positively and negatively charged defects. Combined with a series of theoretical calculations and experimental analyzes, it is demonstrated that the &#9472;C&#9552;O and &#9472;O&#9472; groups in VM can immobilize the uncoordinated Pb2+ to manage the positively charged defect and the formation of N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding can recompense the formamidine vacancies to eliminate the negatively charged defect. In addition, the VM interlayer induces a favorable downshift band bending at the perovskite/ETL interface, facilitating charge separation and boosting charge transfer. Thanks to the reduced charged defects and favorable energy level alignment, the fabricated inverted PerSC delivers an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 24.06% with excellent long&#8208;term ambient and thermal stability. This work demonstrates that managing charged defects via multiple functional groups and simultaneously regulating energy level alignment is a reliable strategy to boost the performance of PerSCs.

         <title>Embedded Host/Guest Alloy Aggregations Enable High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate molecular aggregations are critical to ternary organic solar cells. In this work, a versatile embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregation in the ternary matrix is reported and the primary driving forces to regulate guest distributions are outlined. With optimized molecular packing and exciton/charge properties, exceptional fill factors over 81% are realized from Y6&#8208;free ternary devices, and 19.2% efficiencies are recorded based on Y6&#8208;family acceptors.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been intensively studied to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Thereinto, the location of the guest component plays a critical role, but few reports have been devoted to this concern. Hereon, the distribution of LA1 as a guest acceptor in a variety of ternary scenarios is reported and the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes are outlined. Governed by the appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT&#8208;4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1&#8208;involved alloy structures, and with the Y6&#8208;family acceptor as the host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% is received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ternary strategy has been intensively studied to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Thereinto, the location of the guest component plays a critical role, but few reports have been devoted to this concern. Hereon, the distribution of LA1 as a guest acceptor in a variety of ternary scenarios is reported and the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes are outlined. Governed by the appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy-like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT-4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1-involved alloy structures, and with the Y6-family acceptor as the host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% is received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The challenge with aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) lies in the&#160;design of suitable cathode materials. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional topological Bi2Se3 with acceptable cation vacancies for ZIBs cathode is constructed through one&#8208;step hydrothermal process, which exhibits both enhanced ion and electron transport capability. The remarkable reversible charge storage capacity points to its promising strategy for achieving high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The challenge with aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) lies in finding suitable cathode materials that can provide high capacity and fast kinetics. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional topological Bi2Se3 with acceptable Bi&#8208;vacancies for ZIBs cathode (Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3) is constructed through one&#8208;step hydrothermal process accompanied by Cu heteroatom introduction. The cation&#8208;deficient Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 nanosheets (&#8776;4&#160;nm) bring improved conductivity from large surface topological metal states contribution and enhanced bulk conductivity. Besides, the increased adsorption energy and reduced Zn2+ migration barrier demonstrated by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the decreased Coulombic ion&#8208;lattice repulsion of Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3. Therefore, Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 exhibits both enhanced ion and electron transport capability, leading to more carrier reversible insertion proved by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). These features endow Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 with sufficient specific capacity (320&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate performance (97&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and reliable cycling stability (70&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles). Furthermore, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped ZIBs employing the Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 cathode demonstrate respectable performance and superior flexibility even under high mass loading. This work implements a conceptually innovative strategy represented by cation defect design in topological insulator cathode for achieving high&#8208;performance battery electrochemistry.

Stretchable Electronics
Eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) is an attractive conductor for stretchable electronics but its high surface energy makes sub&#8208;micrometer patterning challenging. In article number 2305967, Francisco Molina&#8208;Lopez, Jan Fransaer, and co&#8208;workers overcome this limitation by electrodeposition, a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach that benefits from the resolution of mature nanofabrication methods. A record&#8208;high integration of EGaIn lines of 300 nm half&#8208;pitch is achieved. Moreover, vertical integration is enabled, leading to omnidirectionally&#8208;stretchable 3D electronics.

mRNA Therapeutics
In article number 2304296, Wenguo Cui, Xiaohua Yu, Zhaoming Ye, and co&#8208;workers report a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS), inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycles nearly 40% expressed cytokines IFN&#8208;&#947;, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors.

Brain&#8208;Targeted Liposomes
In article number 2304654, Avi Schroeder and co&#8208;workers describe a targeted nanotechnology drug delivery system for treating Parkinson's disease. Brain&#8208;targeted liposomes&#8212;nanoparticles engineered with transferrin on their surface and carry therapeutic antibodies, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and effectively treat brain neurodegeneration. This approach reduces pathological alpha&#8208;synuclein aggregation and improves motor skills, demonstrating its potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Based Functional Platforms for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With excellent optical/electrical properties, tunable performance, and good biosafety, MXenes and their derivatives show great prospects in application of tumor therapy. This review summarizes the recent progress of MXenes and MXenes&#8208;derived materials in the construction of functional platforms for precise and effective antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Recently, 2D transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitrides (MXenes) materials stand out in the field of tumor therapy, particularly in the construction of functional platforms for optimal antitumor therapy due to their high specific surface area, tunable performance, strong absorption of near&#8208;infrared light as well as preferable surface plasmon resonance effect. In this review, the progress of MXene&#8208;mediated antitumor therapy is summarized after appropriate modifications or integration procedures. The enhanced antitumor treatments directly performed by MXenes, the significant improving effect of MXenes on different antitumor therapies, as well as the MXene&#8208;mediated imaging&#8208;guided antitumor strategies are discussed in detail. Moreover, the existing challenges and future development directions of MXenes in tumor therapy are presented.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Inorganic Materials with Optical Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>

Y. Duan, S. Che
The study of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials and their optical chiral response is emerging as a remarkably active area and full of challenges and opportunities. Recent advances in experiments and the mechanistic origin of the optical chiral response are reviewed. A fabrication strategy for the realization of chiral structures in inorganic materials with achiral space groups is briefly presented.








Fabricating chiral inorganic materials and revealing their unique quantum confinement&#8208;determined optical chiral responses are crucial tasks in the multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics, and biology. The field of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials started from the synthesis of individual nanocrystals and evolved to include their assembly from metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and inorganic salts endowed with various chiral structures ranging from atomic to micron scales. This tutorial review highlights the recent research on chiral mesostructured inorganic materials, especially the novel expression of mesostructured chirality and endowed optical chiral response, and it may inspire us with new strategies for the design of chiral inorganic materials and new opportunities beyond the traditional applications of chirality. Fabrication methods for chiral mesostructured inorganic materials are classified according to chirality type, scale, and symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanism. Special attention is given to highlight systems with original discoveries, exceptional phenomena, or unique mechanisms of optical chiral response for left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness.

     alt="Chiral Mesostructured Inorganic Materials with Optical Chiral Response"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y. Duan, S. Che&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials and their optical chiral response is emerging as a remarkably active area and full of challenges and opportunities. Recent advances in experiments and the mechanistic origin of the optical chiral response are reviewed. A fabrication strategy for the realization of chiral structures in inorganic materials with achiral space groups is briefly presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabricating chiral inorganic materials and revealing their unique quantum confinement-determined optical chiral responses are crucial tasks in the multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics, and biology. The field of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials started from the synthesis of individual nanocrystals and evolved to include their assembly from metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and inorganic salts endowed with various chiral structures ranging from atomic to micron scales. This tutorial review highlights the recent research on chiral mesostructured inorganic materials, especially the novel expression of mesostructured chirality and endowed optical chiral response, and it may inspire us with new strategies for the design of chiral inorganic materials and new opportunities beyond the traditional applications of chirality. Fabrication methods for chiral mesostructured inorganic materials are classified according to chirality type, scale, and symmetry-breaking mechanism. Special attention is given to highlight systems with original discoveries, exceptional phenomena, or unique mechanisms of optical chiral response for left- and right-handedness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Broadband Emission Origin in Metal Halide Perovskites: Are Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons or Ions?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broadband emission origin of single&#8208;component metal halide perovskites is now recognized as from self&#8208;trapped excitons and/or ns2 ions, whose fundamentals and recent advances are summarized. A clear and comprehensive understanding is offered to meet the design requirements toward highly efficient materials and devices.








Abstract
It has always been a goal to realize high efficiency and broadband emission in single&#8208;component materials. The appearance of metal halide perovskites makes it possible. Their soft lattice characteristics and significant electron&#8211;phonon coupling synergistically generate self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), contributing to a broadband emission with a large Stokes shift. Meanwhile, their structural/compositional diversity provides suitable active sites and coordination environments for doping of ns2 ions, allowing 3Pn(n=0,1,2)&#8594;1S0 transitions toward broadband emission. The ns2 ions emission is phenomenologically similar to that of STE emission, hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of their emission origin, and leading to failure to meet the design requirements for practical applications. In this scenario, herein, the fundamentals and development of such two emission mechanisms are summarized to establish a clear and comprehensive understanding of the broadband emission phenomenon, which may pave the way to an ideal customization of broadband&#8208;emission metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Computing: Materials, Devices, and Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable neuromorphic computing strives for bridging the gap between discrete intelligent paradigms. Developments about reconfigurable neuromorphic computing are systematically overviewed, in which the state&#8208;of&#8208;art strides from the material, device, and integration aspects are included, highlighting their significance in motivating the prosperity of general&#8208;purposed intelligent computing. Perspective on the trends and obstacles of reconfigurable neuromorphic computing is also outlined.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention due to superior energy efficiency, with great promise to promote the next wave of artificial general intelligence in the post&#8208;Moore era. Current approaches are, however, broadly designed for stationary and unitary assignments, thus encountering reluctant interconnections, power consumption, and data&#8208;intensive computing in that domain. Reconfigurable neuromorphic computing, an on&#8208;demand paradigm inspired by the inherent programmability of brain, can maximally reallocate finite resources to perform the proliferation of reproducibly brain&#8208;inspired functions, highlighting a disruptive framework for bridging the gap between different primitives. Although relevant research has flourished in diverse materials and devices with novel mechanisms and architectures, a precise overview remains blank and urgently desirable. Herein, the recent strides along this pursuit are systematically reviewed from material, device, and integration perspectives. At the material and device level, one comprehensively conclude the dominant mechanisms for reconfigurability, categorized into ion migration, carrier migration, phase transition, spintronics, and photonics. Integration&#8208;level developments for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing are also exhibited. Finally, a perspective on the future challenges for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing is discussed, definitely expanding its horizon for scientific communities.

         <title>Toward Sustainable All Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Metal Batteries: Perspectives on Battery Technology and Recycling Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) show promising potential for using in future energy storage devices. However, underexplored recycling aspects for ASSLMBs greatly restrict their sustainable development. Here, recent advancements in recycling technology and potentially viable recycling concepts for ASSLMBs are summarized, along with a discussion on recycling&#8208;oriented battery design. Future directions and perspectives for sustainable ASSLMBs operation are discussed.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;based batteries are gradually evolving from the liquid to the solid state in terms of safety and energy density, where all solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered the most promising candidates. This is demonstrated by the Bluecar electric vehicle produced by the Bollor&#233; Group, which is utilized in car&#8208;sharing services in several cities worldwide. Despite impressive progress in the development of ASSLMBs, their avenues for recycling them remain underexplored, and combined with the current explosion of spent Li&#8208;ion batteries, they should attract widespread interest from academia and industry. Here, the potential challenges of recycling ASSLMBs as compared to Li&#8208;ion batteries are analyzed and the current progress and prospects for recycling ASSLMBs are summarized and analyzed. Drawing on the lessons learned from Li&#8208;ion battery recycling, it is important to design sustainable recycling technologies before ASSLMBs gain widespread market adoption. A battery&#8208;recycling&#8208;oriented design is also highlighted for ASSLMBs to promote the recycling rate and maximize profitability. Finally, future research directions, challenges, and prospects are outlined to provide strategies for achieving sustainable development of ASSLMBs.

First, the fundamental classification, design, characterization, and structural reconstruction of MAECs are outlined. Then, the electrocatalytic merits and modulation strategies of recent breakthroughs for noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;structured MAECs are thoroughly discussed, such as solid solution alloys, intermetallic alloys, and single&#8208;atom alloys. Particularly, unique insights into the bond interactions, theoretical understanding, and operando techniques for mechanism disclosure are given. Thereafter, the current states of diverse MAECs with a unique focus on structural property&#8208;reactivity relationships, reaction pathways, and performance comparisons are discussed. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for MAECs are systematically discussed. It is believed that this comprehensive review can offer a substantial impact on stimulating the widespread utilization of metal alloys&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Organic Sonodynamic Materials for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with sonodynamic therapy for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. This review summarizes the recent progress of organic sonodynamic materials for combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights their synergistic antitumor effects originating from organic sonosensitizer&#8208;mediated SDT and immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;induced immune pathway modulation.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising non&#8208;invasive therapeutic modality to treat deep&#8208;seated tumors owing to the good tissue penetration ability and spatiotemporal controllability of ultrasound (US); however, the low sonodynamic activity and potential side effects greatly limit its clinical translation. Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with SDT for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. In this review, the convergence of SDT with cancer immunotherapy to exert their merits and break through the limitations of combination cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are discussed. The focus is on the development and construction of organic materials with high sonodynamic activity and immunotherapeutic efficiency. These organic materials not only induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor immunogenicity via SDT but also activate antitumor immunity via immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;mediated immune pathway modulation. The combination of various immuno&#8208;oncology drugs with organic sonosensitizers is categorized and discussed along with the prospects and challenges for clinical translation.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Enables mRNA Delivery for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for&#160;mRNA delivery, including component screening, internal ratio optimization, surface modification, and route of administration. Then, the applications of mRNA&#8208;LNP in cancer therapy are reviewed, including vaccines, antibodies, cytokines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;based cell therapy, tumor suppressors, and genome editing. Finally, current challenges and future directions of this field are discussed.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) has received great attention in the prevention and treatment of various diseases due to the success of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19)&#160;mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax). To meet the therapeutic purpose, it is required that mRNA must enter the target cells and express sufficient proteins. Therefore, the development of effective delivery systems is necessary and crucial. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) represents a remarkable vehicle that has indeed accelerated mRNA applications in humans, as several mRNA&#8208;based therapies have already been approved or are in clinical trials. In this review, the focus is on mRNA&#8208;LNP&#8208;mediated anticancer therapy. It summarizes the main development strategies of mRNA&#8208;LNP formulations, discusses representative therapeutic approaches in cancer, and points out current challenges and possible future directions of this research field. It is hoped that these delivered messages can help further improve the application of mRNA&#8208;LNP technology in cancer therapy.

         <title>Stability Issues in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances in Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses the stability issues in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), covering the fundamental understanding on the destabilization mechanisms from electrocatalyst degradation to microenvironment evolution, and effective strategies to enhance the CO2RR stability from designing the robust electrocatalysts, optimizing the electrolysis system to manipulating the operation conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle and store intermittent renewable energy in fuels or chemicals. On the path to commercializing this technology, achieving the long&#8208;term operation stability is a central requirement but still confronts challenges. This motivates to organize the present review to systematically discuss the stability issue of CO2RR. This review starts from the fundamental understanding on the destabilization mechanisms of CO2RR, with focus on the degradation of electrocatalyst and change of reaction microenvironment during continuous electrolysis. Subsequently, recent efforts on catalyst design to stabilize the active sites are summarized, where increasing atomic binding strength to resist surface reconstruction is highlighted. Next, the optimization of electrolysis system to enhance the operation stability by maintaining reaction microenvironment especially mitigating flooding and carbonate problems is demonstrated. The manipulation on operation conditions also enables to prolong CO2RR lifespan through recovering catalytically active sites and mass transport process. This review finally ends up by indicating the challenges and future opportunities.

         <title>Fiber Crossbars: An Emerging Architecture of Smart Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 51, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber crossbars (FCs), constructed by two crossing fibers, have become an emerging architecture of smart electronic textiles. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the structure design, material selections, assembly techniques, and applications of FC&#8208;based devices. Challenges, potential solutions, and future perspectives for FC&#8208;based systems are also discussed for their future development in scale&#8208;up production and commercialization.








Abstract
Smart wearables have a significant impact on people's daily lives, enabling personalized motion monitoring, realizing the Internet of Things, and even reshaping the next generation of telemedicine systems. Fiber crossbars (FCs), constructed by crossing two fibers, have become an emerging architecture among the accessible structures of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart electronic textiles. The mechanical, chemical, and electrical interactions between crossing fibers result in extensive functionalities, leading to the significant development of innovative electronic textiles employing FCs as their basic units. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the structure designs, material selections, and assembly techniques of FC&#8208;based devices. The recent advances in FC&#8208;based devices are summarized, including multipurpose sensing, multiple&#8208;mode computing, high&#8208;resolution display, high&#8208;efficient power supply, and large&#8208;scale textile systems. Finally, current challenges, potential solutions, and future perspectives for FC&#8208;based systems are discussed for their further development in scale&#8208;up production and commercial applications.

         <title>Saltwater&#8208;Induced Rapid Gelation of Photoredox&#8208;Responsive Mucomimetic Hydrogels</title>

Abstract
Shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels represent an important class of injectable soft materials that are often used in a wide range of biomedical applications. Typically, the hydrogel network is formed prior to injection and &#8220;heals&#8221; once the shearing forces have been removed. However, creation of new shear&#8208;thinning materials often requires that factors such as viscosity, injection rate/force, and needle gauge be evaluated to achieve efficient delivery, while simultaneously protecting potentially sensitive cargo (e.g., cells). Here, a new approach to establishing shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels is reported where a host&#8208;guest crosslinked network initially remains soluble in deionized water but is kinetically trapped as a viscous hydrogel once exposed to a high ionic strength solution. The shear&#8208;thinning properties of the viscous hydrogel may then be &#8220;switched on&#8221; in response to heating or exposure to visible light. These hydrogels consist of polynorbornene&#8208;based bottlebrush copolymers with porphyrin&#8208; and oligoviologen&#8208;containing side chains that are crosslinked through the reversible formation of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8211;adamantane host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes. The resultant viscous hydrogels displayed broad adhesive properties across polar and non&#8208;polar substrates, mimicking that of natural mucous and thus making it easier to distribute onto a wide range of surfaces. Additional control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties (storage/loss moduli) and performance (adhesion) was achieved post&#8208;injection using a low&#8208;energy (blue light) photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process. We envision these injectable copolymers and corresponding multimodal viscous hydrogels can serve as versatile next&#8208;generation biomaterials capable of light&#8208;based mechanical manipulation post&#8208;injection.

Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries has received wide attention owing to its potential for resource reuse and environmental benefits. The repair effect of direct regeneration methods undergoing heterogeneous repair process is usually inferior, while homogenous repair process plays a vital role to achieve satisfactory repair results. However, the practical applications of current homogeneous repair methods are challenged by the complex operations and relatively high costs owing to the requirement of additional heating or pressurization. Herein, we propose a simple strategy to achieve homogeneous repair of spent cathode materials under relatively mild conditions by uniformly pre&#8208;coating lithium source at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Followed by annealing, highly degraded LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 with severe Li deficiency and irreversible phase transition was repaired to have an initial capacity of 181.6 mAh g&#8208;1 and capacity retention of 80.7% after 150 cycles at 0.5 C. The lithium source used in this strategy is from the spent lithium anode. Moreover, this strategy is suitable for the direct regeneration of various layer oxide cathode materials with different failure degrees. This work provides both theoretical guidance and practical examples for the straightforward, effective and universally applicable direct regeneration methods.

&lt;p&gt;Direct regeneration of spent lithium-ion batteries has received wide attention owing to its potential for resource reuse and environmental benefits. The repair effect of direct regeneration methods undergoing heterogeneous repair process is usually inferior, while homogenous repair process plays a vital role to achieve satisfactory repair results. However, the practical applications of current homogeneous repair methods are challenged by the complex operations and relatively high costs owing to the requirement of additional heating or pressurization. Herein, we propose a simple strategy to achieve homogeneous repair of spent cathode materials under relatively mild conditions by uniformly pre-coating lithium source at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Transport&#8208;Limited Growth of Coccolith Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coccoliths are microscopic crystal&#8208;arrays created by unicellular organisms. Coccoliths display diverse and intricate structures that surpass what can be currently synthesized. This research reveals that the nuanced morphology of coccolith crystals is governed by a delicate interplay between transport&#8208;limited and reaction&#8208;limited growth, mirroring processes observed in snowflake formation.








Abstract
Biogenic crystals present a variety of complex morphologies that form with exquisite fidelity. In the case of the intricate morphologies of coccoliths, calcite crystals produced by marine algae, only a single set of crystallographic facets is utilized. It is unclear which growth process can merge this simple crystallographic habit with the species&#8208;specific architectures. Here, a suite of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electron microscopies is used to follow both the growth trajectories of the crystals ex&#160;situ, and the cellular environment in&#160;situ, in the species Emiliania huxleyi. It is shown that crystal growth alternates between a space filling and a skeletonized growth mode, where the crystals elongate via their stable crystallographic facets, but the final morphology is a manifestation of growth arrest. This process is reminiscent of the balance between reaction&#8208;limited and transport&#8208;limited growth regimes underlying snowflake formation. It is suggested that localized ion transport regulates the kinetic instabilities that are required for transport&#8208;limited growth, leading to reproducible morphologies.

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of a Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retention of individual gold nanoparticles on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining, is enabled via a simple and versatile strategy. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single&#8208;nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano&#8208;optics, and catalysis.

         <title>Highly Stable Layered Coordination Polymer Electrocatalyst toward Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT) is developed to stabilize Cu2+ through Cu2+ and ethylenedioxythiophene coordination, which has high electrochemical and structural stability in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Cu2+&#8208;based materials, a class of promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals, usually undergo inevitable and uncontrollable reorganization processes during the reaction, resulting in catalyst deactivation or the new active sites formation and bringing great challenges to exploring their structure&#8211;performance relationships. Herein, a facile strategy is reported for constructing Cu2+ and 3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) coordination to stabilize Cu2+ ions to prepare a novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT). CuPEDOT enables selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 with 62.7% Faradaic efficiency at the current density of 354&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, and the catalyst is stable for at least 15&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu2+&#8208;EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO2RR and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH4 instead of dimerization to C2 products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu2+ prevents the reduction of Cu2+ ions during CO2RR. The finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Multiple H&#8208;Bonding Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Storage and Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymeric solid&#8211;solid phase change material with high latent heat storage and superior mechanical strength is developed for thermal energy storage (TES and management through the construction of multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions within the polymer. This study provides new guidance for combining high TES density, robust mechanical properties, and sound thermal stability in one material.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) are considered among the most promising candidates for thermal energy storage and management. However, the application of SSPCMs is consistently hindered by the canonical trade&#8208;off between high TES capacity and mechanical robustness. In addition, they suffer from poor recyclability due to chemical cross&#8208;linking. Herein, a straightforward but effective strategy for fabricating supramolecular SSPCMs with high latent heat and mechanical strength is proposed. The supramolecular polymer employs multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions as robust physical cross&#8208;links. This enables SSPCM with a high enthalpy of phase transition (142.5 J g&#8722;1), strong mechanical strength (36.9&#160;MPa), and sound shape stability (maintaining shape integrity at 120 &#176;C) even with a high content of phase change component (97 wt%). When SSPCM is utilized to regulate the operating temperature of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, it significantly diminishes the battery working temperature by 23 &#176;C at a discharge rate of 3 C. The robust thermal management capability enabled through solid&#8211;solid phase change provides practical opportunities for applications in fast discharging and high&#8208;power batteries. Overall, this study presents a feasible strategy for designing linear SSPCMs with high latent heat and exceptional mechanical strength for thermal management.

This work presents a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch (termed F&#8208;MN patch) that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG), aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. The F&#8208;MN patch harnesses personal mechanical movements to generate electrical energy, driving delivered therapeutic drugs to deeper locations in the skin and achieving superior therapeutic efficacy in treating solid tumors in deep site.








Abstract
Effective treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors relies on enhanced drug penetration in transdermal drug delivery systems. While microneedles (MNs) and iontophoresis techniques have shown improved transdermal drug delivery efficiency, challenges such as skin elasticity, high electrical resistance of the stratum corneum, and external power supply requirements hinder their efficacy in treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. In this study, a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is presented, aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. MNs are composed of water&#8208;soluble materials mixed with negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with therapeutic drugs. The F&#8208;TENG harnesses personal mechanical movements generate electrical energy. Leveraging the advantages of both MNs and F&#8208;TENG, therapeutic NPs can penetrate deep skin locations upon MN patch insertion, releasing drugs rapidly in acidic tumor tissues. Owing to these features, a single administration of the integrated MN&#8208;patch in a mouse model with deep&#8208;seated melanoma exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting deep&#8208;located tumor compared to using the MN&#8208;patch alone, indicating promising potential for treating tumors at deep sites.

         <title>Waterproof and Flexible Perovskite Photodetector Enabled By P&#8208;type Organic Molecular Rubrene with High Moisture and Mechanical Stability</title>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite films have gained significant attention because of their remarkable optoelectronic performances. However, their poor stability upon the severe environment appears to be one of the main facets that impedes their further commercial applications. Herein, a method to improve the stability of flexible photodetectors under water and humidity environment without encapsulation is reported. The devices were fabricated using the physical vapor deposition method (Pulse Laser Deposition &amp; Thermal Evaporation) under high&#8208;vacuum conditions. An amorphous organic Rubrene film with low molecular polarity and high elastic modulus serves as both a protective layer and hole transport layer. After immersed in water for 6000&#160;min, the photoluminescence intensity attenuation of films only decreased by a maximum of 10%. The demonstrator device, based on Rubrene/CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction confirms that our strategy not only enhances device moisture and mechanical stability but also achieves high sensitivity in optoelectronic detection. In self&#8208;powered mode, it has a fast response time of 79.4 &#956;s /207.6 &#956;s and a responsivity 124&#160;mA/W. Additionally, the absence of encapsulation simplifies the fabrication of complex electrodes, making it suitable for various applications. This study highlights the potential use of amorphous organic films in improving the stability of perovskite&#8208;based flexible devices.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Magnetic Topological Insulator Trilayers of Hundred&#8208;Nanometer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic topological states refer to a class of exotic phases in magnetic materials with their non&#8208;trivial topological property determined by magnetic spin configurations. An example of such states is the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, which is a zero magnetic field manifestation of the quantum Hall effect1. Current research in this direction focuses on QAH insulators with a thickness of less than 10&#160;nm (Refs.1&#8211;9). The thick QAH insulators in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) regime are limited, largely due to inevitable bulk carriers being introduced in thick magnetic TI samples. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to synthesize magnetic TI trilayers with a thickness of up to &#8764;106&#160;nm. We find these samples exhibit well&#8208;quantized Hall resistance and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. By varying the magnetic dopants, gate voltages, temperature, and external magnetic fields, we examine the properties of these thick QAH insulators and demonstrate the robustness of the 3D QAH effect. The realization of the well&#8208;quantized 3D QAH effect indicates that the nonchiral side surface states of our thick magnetic TI trilayers are gapped and thus do not affect the QAH quantization. The 3D QAH insulators of hundred&#8208;nanometer thickness provide a promising platform for the exploration of fundamental physics, including axion physics and image magnetic monopole10, and the advancement of electronic and spintronic devices to circumvent Moore's law.

         <title>Constructing Fully&#8208;Active and Ultra&#8208;Active Sites in High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoclusters for Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Electrolytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production requires high operating voltages (&gt;1.23&#8201;V) and electricity cost, encumbering its large&#8208;scale applications. The development of more high&#8208;efficiency systems and sufficiently effective catalysts for hydrogen production is of great significance but challenging. Here, we innovatively construct high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoclusters (HEANCs) with full&#8208;active sites and super&#8208;active sites for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted electrolytic hydrogen production. The HEANCs show an average size of only 7 atomic layers (1.48&#160;nm) and uniform distribution on carbon supports. As the catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction, the HEANC/C exhibits the best&#8208;level performance among reported electrocatalysts. Especially, the HEANC/C achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of 12.85 A mg&#8722;1noble metals at &#8208;0.07&#160;V and overpotential of only 9.5&#160;mV for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for alkaline HER. Furthermore, with HEANC/C as both anode and cathode catalysts, an overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer shows a record mass activity of 250.2&#160;mA mg&#8722;1catalysts at 0.1&#160;V, and only requires working voltages of 0.025 and 0.181&#160;V to reach 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming those of overall water&#8208;splitting system and other reported chemicals&#8208;assisted hydrogen production systems. Active site libraries including 72 sites on HEANC surface were originally constructed by theoretical calculations, revealing that all sites on HEANC surface are effectively active sites for OHzS, especially some are super&#8208;active sites, endowing the best&#8208;level performance of HEANC/C. This work not only highlights HEANCs as sufficiently effective bifunctional catalysts in practical OHzS systems, but also opens up a new avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;activity catalysts in energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Design of A Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, we engineer a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design&#8208;build&#8208;test&#8208;learn cycle, we wire the modules according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. We design a 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that could perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and could be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.

         <title>Spontaneous Modulation Doping in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated Polymers Leads to High Conductivity at Low Doping Concentration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The possibility to control the charge carrier density through doping is one of the defining properties of semiconductors. For organic semiconductors, the doping process is known to come with several problems associated with the dopant compromising the charge carrier mobility by deteriorating the host morphology and/or introducing Coulomb traps. While for inorganic semiconductors these factors can be mitigated through (top&#8208;down) modulation doping, this concept has not been employed in organics. Here, we show that properly chosen host/dopant combinations can give rise to spontaneous, bottom&#8208;up modulation doping, in which the dopants preferentially sit in an amorphous phase, while the actual charge transport occurs predominantly in a crystalline phase with an unaltered microstructure, spatially separating dopants and mobile charges. Combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that this leads to exceptionally high conductivities at relatively low dopant concentrations.

Here, we show that properly chosen host/dopant combinations can give rise to spontaneous, bottom-up modulation doping, in which the dopants preferentially sit in an amorphous phase, while the actual charge transport occurs predominantly in a crystalline phase with an unaltered microstructure, spatially separating dopants and mobile charges. Combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that this leads to exceptionally high conductivities at relatively low dopant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing System for Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing chemistry, employing a thermally stable bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic Ru&#8208;carbene catalyst and a Cu(I) activator, addresses the thermal instability challenges of previous self&#8208;healing chemistries, enabling self&#8208;healing in a polydicyclopentadiene thermoset which is initially cured at &#8776;200 &#176;C via frontal polymerization.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing offers promise for addressing structural failures, increasing lifespan, and improving durability in polymeric materials. Implementing self&#8208;healing in thermoset polymers faces significant manufacturing challenges, especially due to the elevated temperature requirements of thermoset processing. To introduce self&#8208;healing into structural thermosets, the self&#8208;healing system must be thermally stable and compatible with the thermoset chemistry. This article demonstrates a self&#8208;healing microcapsule&#8208;based system stable to frontal polymerization (FP), a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing process with a self&#8208;propagating exothermic reaction (&#8776;200 &#176;C). A thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type complex bearing two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands addresses limitations in conventional G2&#8208;based self&#8208;healing approaches. Under FP's elevated temperatures, the catalyst remains dormant until activated by a Cu(I) co&#8208;reagent, ensuring efficient polymerization of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) upon damage to the polyDCPD matrix. The two&#8208;part microcapsule system consists of one capsule containing the thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type catalyst dissolved in the solvent, and another capsule containing a Cu(I) coagent blended with liquid DCPD monomer. Using the same chemistry for both matrix fabrication and healing results in strong interfaces as demonstrated by lap&#8208;shear tests. In an optimized system, the self&#8208;healing system restores the mechanical properties of the tough polyDCPD thermoset. Self&#8208;healing efficiencies greater than 90% via tapered double cantilever beam tests are observed.

         <title>2D Materials Beyond Post&#8208;AI Era: Smart Fibers, Soft Robotics, and Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three emerging applications of 2D materials in the post&#8208;artificial intelligence (AI) era. 2D&#8208;based smart fibers demonstrate diverse functionalities, ranging from healthcare monitoring to antipathogenic protection in a wearable manner. Soft robotics addresses the limitations of conventional robotics by introducing 2D&#8208;hybridized soft actuators and sensors. Single atom catalysts supported on 2D materials contribute sustainable energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Recent consecutive discoveries of various 2D materials have triggered significant scientific and technological interests owing to their exceptional material properties, originally stemming from 2D confined geometry. Ever&#8208;expanding library of 2D materials can provide ideal solutions to critical challenges facing in current technological trend of the fourth industrial revolution. Moreover, chemical modification of 2D materials to customize their physical/chemical properties can satisfy the broad spectrum of different specific requirements across diverse application areas. This review focuses on three particular emerging application areas of 2D materials: smart fibers, soft robotics, and single atom catalysts (SACs),&#160;which hold immense potentials for academic and technological advancements in the post&#8208;artificial intelligence (AI) era. Smart fibers showcase unconventional functionalities including healthcare/environmental monitoring, energy storage/harvesting, and antipathogenic protection in the forms of wearable fibers and textiles. Soft robotics aligns with future trend to overcome longstanding limitations of hard&#8208;material based mechanics by introducing soft actuators and sensors. SACs are widely useful in energy storage/conversion and environmental management, principally contributing to low carbon footprint for sustainable post&#8208;AI&#160;era. Significance and unique values of 2D materials in these emerging applications are highlighted, where the research group has devoted research efforts for more than a decade.

         <title>Covert Scattering Control in Metamaterials with Non&#8208;Locally Encoded Hidden Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resilience of symmetry&#8208;based scattering control against reverse engineering is experimentally achieved in a programmable cable network metamaterial with non&#8208;locally encoded hidden symmetry. An application to secure wired communications and the observation of exceptional points of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states are achieved in complex metamaterials without apparent symmetry, including cases with non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms.








Abstract
Symmetries and tunability are of fundamental importance in wave scattering control, but symmetries are often obvious upon visual inspection, which constitutes a significant vulnerability of metamaterial wave devices to reverse&#8208;engineering risks. Here, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that a symmetry in the reduced basis of the &#8220;primary meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; that are directly connected to the outside world is sufficient; meanwhile, a suitable topology of non&#8208;local interactions between them, mediated by the internal &#8220;secondary&#8221; meta&#8208;atoms, can hide the symmetry from sight in the canonical basis. Covert symmetry&#8208;based scattering control in a cable&#8208;network metamaterial featuring a hidden parity (P$\mathcal {P}$) symmetry in combination with hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;preserving and hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking tuning mechanisms is experimentally demonstrated. Physical&#8208;layer security in wired communications is achieved using the domain&#8208;wise hidden P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry as a shared secret between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Within the approximation of negligible absorption, the first tuning of a complex scattering metamaterial without mirror symmetry to feature exceptional points (EPs) of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states, as well as quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum, is reported. These results are reproduced in metamaterials involving non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms, including the first observation of reflectionless EPs in a non&#8208;reciprocal&#160;system.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Controlled Growth of rBN Crystalline Films with High Nonlinear Optical Conversion Efficiency up to 1%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stacking&#8208;controlled continuous precipitation strategy is proposed to synthesize uniform rBN crystalline films (lateral size of 2 &#215; 1 cm2, thickness of &gt;1&#160;&#181;m) on the vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal. The rBN films with parallel stacked layers exhibit ultrahigh nonlinear optical response with the record&#8208;high frequency conversion efficiency of 1% in the 2D&#8208;material family.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical crystals lie at the core of ultrafast laser science and quantum communication technology. The emergence of 2D&#160;materials provides a revolutionary potential for nonlinear optical crystals due to their exceptionally high nonlinear coefficients. However, uncontrolled stacking orders generally induce the destructive nonlinear response due to the optical phase deviation in different 2D layers. Therefore, conversion efficiency of 2D nonlinear crystals is typically limited to less than 0.01% (far below the practical criterion of &gt;1%). Here, crystalline films of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) with parallel stacked layers are controllably synthesized. This success is realized by the utilization of vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal, where both the unidirectional arrangement of BN grains into a single&#8208;crystal monolayer and the continuous precipitation of (B,N) source for thick layers are guaranteed. The preserved in&#8208;plane inversion asymmetry in rBN films keeps the in&#8208;phase second&#8208;harmonic generation field in every layer and leads to a record&#8208;high conversion efficiency of 1% in the whole family of 2D materials within the coherence thickness of only 1.6&#160;&#181;m. The work provides a route for designing ultrathin nonlinear optical crystals from 2D materials, and will promote the on&#8208;demand fabrication of integrated photonic and compact quantum optical devices.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Responsive Sliver Peroxide&#8208;Nanocarrier Serves as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase Inhibitor for Combating Severe Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;responsive nanovesicle, Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, capable of a broad&#8208;spectrum metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibition is developed to address pneumonia caused by MBL&#8208;producing bacteria. The efficacy of these nanovesicles is validated in two infection models, evidenced by significant reduction of bacterial loadings, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels, and the recruitment of immune cells. This innovative approach presents a promising strategy for combating infections of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria.








Abstract
Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) represent a prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, rendering last&#8208;line carbapenem&#8208;related antibiotics ineffective. Here, a bioresponsive sliver peroxide (Ag2O2)&#8208;based nanovesicle, named Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, is developed as a broad&#8208;spectrum MBL inhibitor for combating MBL&#8208;producing bacterial pneumonia. Ag2O2 nanoparticle is first orderly modified with bovine serum albumin and polydopamine to co&#8208;load meropenem (MER) and [5&#8208;(p&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;ureido]&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide (TPCA&#8208;1) and then encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) aimed to target inflammatory lung tissue specifically. The resultant Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM effectively abrogates MBL activity by displacing the Zn2+ cofactor in MBLs with Ag+ and displays potent bactericidal and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, specific targeting abilities, and great bioresponsive characteristics. After intravenous injection, the nanoparticles accumulate prominently at infection sites through MM&#8208;mediated targeting . Ag+ released from Ag2O2 decomposition at the infection sites effectively inhibits MBL activity and overcomes the resistance of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria to MER, resulting in synergistic elimination of bacteria in conjunction with MER. In two murine infection models of NDM&#8208;1+ Klebsiella pneumoniae&#8208;induced severe pneumonia and NDM&#8208;1+ Escherichia coli&#8208;induced sepsis&#8208;related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduce bacterial loading, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL&#8208;producing carbapenem&#8208;resistant bacteria.

&lt;p&gt;A bio-responsive nanovesicle, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@BP-MT@MM, capable of a broad-spectrum metallo-&#946;-lactamase (MBL) inhibition is developed to address pneumonia caused by MBL-producing bacteria.

         <title>Novel Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D SbBi Alloy Structure with Precise Regulation Ratio Enables Long&#8208;Stable Potassium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D thin&#8208;layer binary SbBi alloy is designed, which displays superior 2D structural stability, highly reversible alloying/dealloying, fast K/Li storage kinetics, and ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycle stability in potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs).








Abstract
The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of 2D Sb or Bi limit their applications in high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;stability potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high&#8208;capacity Sb and high&#8208;stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one&#8208;step co&#8208;replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode exhibits high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode has a high&#8208;stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 (&#8776;87.8% retention) and an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling stability of 1000 cycles (0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism is revealed by kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra&#8208;stable structure and synergistic interaction within the 2D&#8208;binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K+ adsorption energy, and decreases the K+ diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D&#8208;Bi or 2D&#8208;Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Regulation of Pt Strain Derived from Pt3Ga Intermetallic for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by altering the symmetry of the PtGa&#8208;intermetallic structure, the stress environment in the surface Pt layer is precisely modified. By increasing strain, the key intermediate desorption step accelerates, resulting Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{\it 3}$m) with high symmetry exhibiting 10 times higher mass activity than commercial PtC and other samples with stretched surface.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based fuel cell catalysts with excellent activity and stability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been developed through strain regulation in recent years. Herein, this work demonstrates that symmetry&#8208;induced strain regulation of Pt surface of PtGa intermetallic compounds can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With the strain environment varies derived from the lattice mismatch of analogous PtGa core but different symmetry, the Pt surface of the PtGa alloy and the Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) precisely realize 0.58% and 2.7% compressive strain compared to the Pt3Ga (P4/mmm). Experimental and theoretical results reveal that when the compressive stress of the Pt lattice increases, the desorption process of O* intermediates becomes accelerated, which is conducive to oxygen reduction. The Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) with high symmetry and compressive Pt surface exhibit the highest mass and specific activities of 2.18 A mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.36 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, which are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This work demonstrates that material symmetry can be used to precisely modulate Pt surface stress to enhance the ORR, as well as provide a distinct platform to investigate the relationship between Pt compressibility and catalytic activity.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Multimodal and Accurate Human&#8211;Machine Interaction System for Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes high&#8208;performance hydrogel sensors enabled multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction system to address the issue of weak signals in human&#8211;computer interaction from stroke or myasthenia patients, which can detect high&#8208;quality electromyogram and muscle deformation signals and couple them to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;accuracy interaction.








Abstract
Human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, this work develops a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel&#8208;based sensors and a self&#8208;designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multichannel EMG signals, the multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human&#8211;machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI&#8208;powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.

         <title>&#8220;Soggy&#8208;Sand&#8221; Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes are designed for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By acting to decrease the water molecules' reactivity, aiding in uniform zinc deposition, and capturing anions to hasten Zn2+ transport, &#8216;soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes address several of the core challenges faced by conventional electrolytes. This work provides a new concept for activating the electrochemical properties of aqueous rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrites prevent the use of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte&#8208;insulator dispersions) are developed for achieving high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;ion batteries. How these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes is revealed.

     alt="&#8220;Soggy-Sand&#8221; Chemistry for High-Voltage Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Soggy-sand&#8217; electrolytes are designed for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. By acting to decrease the water molecules' reactivity, aiding in uniform zinc deposition, and capturing anions to hasten Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, &#8216;soggy-sand&#8217; electrolytes address several of the core challenges faced by conventional electrolytes. This work provides a new concept for activating the electrochemical properties of aqueous rechargeable batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrites prevent the use of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy-sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte-insulator dispersions) are developed for achieving high-voltage Zn-ion batteries. How these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes is revealed. The oxide additions adsorb water molecules and trap anions, causing a network of space charge layers with increased Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number and reduced interfacial resistance. They beneficially modify the hydrogen bond network and solvation structures, thereby influencing the mechanical and electrochemical properties, and causing the Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the solution to be oxidized. As a result, the best performing Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based &#8220;soggy-sand&#8221; electrolyte exhibits a long life&#160;of 2500 h in Zn||Zn cells. Furthermore, it increases the charging cut-off voltage for Zn/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells to 2&#160;V, achieving higher specific capacities. Even with amass loading of 10 mg&lt;sub&gt;MnO2&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it yields a promising specific capacity of 189 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles.

         <title>Platinum Prodrug Nanoparticles with COX&#8208;2 Inhibition Amplify Pyroptosis for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immune Activation of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic polymer (PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) incorporating a Pt(IV) prodrug and indomethacin (In) is developed here. PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In can further self&#8208;assemble to form Pt&#8208;In NP, which overcomes the chemoresistance and amplifies cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Overall, this platform holds great promise for improving the immune response of platinum drugs, which presents a generalizable strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, an emerging mechanism of programmed cell death, holds great potential to trigger a robust antitumor immune response. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents can induce pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 activation. However, these agents also enhance cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression in tumor tissues, leading to drug resistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and significantly limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Here, an amphiphilic polymer (denoted as PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) containing both indomethacin (In, a COX&#8208;2 inhibitor) and platinum(IV) prodrug (Pt(IV)) is developed, which is responsive to glutathione (GSH). This polymer self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&#8208;In NP) that can disintegrate in cancer cells due to the GSH responsiveness, releasing In to inhibit the COX&#8208;2 expression, hence overcoming the chemoresistance and amplifying cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, Pt&#8208;In NP significantly inhibit tumor growth and elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, when combined with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) treatment, Pt&#8208;In NP demonstrate the ability to completely suppress metastatic tumors, transforming &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;. Overall, the sustained release of Pt(IV) and In from Pt&#8208;In NP amplifies platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced pyroptosis to elicit long&#8208;term immune responses, hence presenting a generalizable strategy for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Nonepitaxial Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Materials on Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy of nonepitaxial synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates is presented. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. The findings of this study provide a universal epitaxial platform for single&#8208;crystal 2D material production.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation nanodevices require 2D material synthesis on insulating substrates. However, growing high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene, on insulators is challenging owing to the lack of suitable metal catalysts, imperfect lattice matching with substrates, and other factors. Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high&#8208;quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies being explored. Herein, a universal strategy is introduced for the nonepitaxial synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. High&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area, single&#8208;crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single&#8208;crystal film production.

         <title>Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticle Reporters for High&#8208;Precision Urinalysis of In Situ Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) are used to develop urinal reporters with defined ligand valence and spacing. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and membrane proteins (MPs) exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under fluid microenvironment, enabling reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measuring the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters.








Abstract
The expression of disease&#8208;specific membrane proteins (MPs) is a crucial indicator for evaluating the onset and progression of diseases. Urinalysis of in situ MPs has the potential for point&#8208;of&#8208;care disease diagnostics, yet remains challenging due to the lack of molecular reporter to transform the expression information of in situ MPs into the measurable urine composition. Herein, a series of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDFs) are employed as the cores of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) to direct the self&#8208;assembly of PAN reporters with defined ligand valence and spatial distribution. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and MPs exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under renal tubule&#8208;mimic fluid microenvironment, thus enabling high&#8208;fidelity conversion of MPs expression level into binding events and reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measurement of the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters. Such PAN reporter&#8208;mediated signal transformation mechanism empowers urinalysis of the onset of acute kidney injury at least 6&#8201;h earlier than the existing methods with an area under the curve of 100%. This strategy has the potential for urinalysis of a variety of in situ membrane proteins.

         <title>Switchable Design of Redox&#8208;Enhanced Nonaromatic Quinones Enabled by Conjugation Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An innovative switchable design strategy for modulating the electronic structures of quinones is proposed herein, leading to remarkably enhanced intrinsic redox potentials by restoring conjugated but nonaromatic backbone architectures. Computational validation of two fundamental hypotheses confirms the recovery of backbone conjugation and optimal utilization of the inductive effect in switched quinones, which affords significantly improved redox chemistry and overall performance compared to reference quinones. Geometric and electronic analyses provide strong evidence for the restored backbone conjugation and nonaromaticity in the switched quinones, while highlighting the reinforcement of the inductive effect and suppression of the resonance effect. This strategic approach facilitates the development of an exceptional quinone, viz. 2,6&#8208;naphthoquinone, with outstanding performance parameters (338.9 mAh/g and 912.9 mWh/g). Furthermore, 2,6&#8208;anthraquinone with superior cyclic stability, demonstrates comparable performance (257.4 mAh/g and 702.8 mWh/g). These findings offer valuable insights into the design of organic cathode materials with favorable redox chemistry in secondary batteries.

With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena have been observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, we firstly propose and experimentally observe an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937;${\bf \Omega}$ created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum l=2$l=2$ are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;${\bf \Omega}$. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Lattice Engineering on Li2CO3&#8208;Based Sacrificial Cathode Pre&#8208;lithiation Agent for Improving The Energy Density of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Full&#8208;Cell</title>

Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode pre&#8208;lithiation technology to compensate for active lithium loss is vital for improving the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells. Li2CO3 owns high theoretical specific capacity, superior air stability, but poor conductivity as an insulator, acting as a promising but challenging pre&#8208;lithiation agent candidate. Herein, extracting a trace amount of Co from LiCoO2 (LCO), we develop a lattice engineering through substituting Li sites with Co and inducing Li defects to obtain Co&#8208;Li2CO3@LCO, in which both the bandgap and Li&#8208;O bond strength have essentially declined. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Li defects and bulk phase catalytic regulation of Co, the potential of Li2CO3 deep decomposition significantly decreases from typical &gt;4.7&#160;V to &#8764;4.25&#160;V versus Li/Li+, presenting &gt;600 mAh/g compensation capacity. Impressively, coupling 5 wt% Co&#8208;Li2CO3@LCO within NCM&#8208;811 cathode, 235&#160;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell is achieved, performing 88% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Regulated Nanochannels for Flexible Hydrovoltaic Ion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion&#8208;selective nanochannels could theoretically be employed for high&#8208;performance ion sensing, yet the indeterminate ion&#8208;sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance has rarely been explored. Herein, we present a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing abilities across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip&#8208;coating silk fibroin on an electrospinning nylon&#8208;66 nanofiber film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of approximately about 25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100&#160;M and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes. The fabricated flexible ion&#8208;sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace&#8208;ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polyimide Curly Nanofibrous Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Thermal Insulation Under Extreme Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Maintaining human body temperature is one of the basic needs for living, which requires high&#8208;performance thermal insulation materials to prevent heat exchange with external environment. However, the most widely used fibrous thermal insulation materials always suffer from the heavy weight, weak mechanical property, and moderate capacity to suppress heat transfer, resulting in limited personal cold and thermal protection performance. Here, an ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally insulating polyimide aerogel is directly synthesized via constructing 3D interlocked curly nanofibrous networks during electrospinning. Controlling the solution/H2O molecule interaction enables the rapid phase inversion of charged jets, while the multiple jets are ejected by regulating charge density of the fluids, thus synergistically allowing numerous curly nanofibers to interlock and crosslink with each other to form porous aerogel structure. The resulted polyimide aerogel integrates the ultralight property with density of 2.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;3, extreme temperature tolerance (mechanical robustness over &#8208;196&#8211;300&#176;C), and thermal insulation performance with ultralow thermal conductivity of 22.4&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, providing an ideal candidate to keep human thermal comfort under extreme temperature. This work could provide a source of inspiration for the design and development of nanofibrous aerogels for various applications.

         <title>Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy Augmentation via Sequential Nanocomposite Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Reprogramming of Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts in Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In osteosarcoma, immunotherapy often faces hurdles posed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete dense extracellular matrix components and cytokines. Directly removing CAFs may prove ineffective and even promote tumor metastasis. To address this challenge, we developed a sequential nanocomposite hydrogel that reshaped CAF behavior, enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells in osteosarcoma. Our approach utilized an injectable blend of carboxymethyl chitosan and tetrabasic polyethylene glycol, forming a nano hydrogel for controlled release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor, Nox4i) and liposomal Doxorubicin (L&#8208;Dox) to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) upon in situ administration. Nox4i effectively counters CAF activation, overcoming T&#8208;cell exclusion mechanisms, followed by programmed L&#8208;Dox release for ICD in stroma&#8208;rich osteosarcoma models. Combining the co&#8208;delivery gel with &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint inhibitor further enhanced its effectiveness in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Immunophenotyping data underscored a significant boost in tumor T cell infiltration and favorable anti&#8208;tumor immunity at the whole&#8208;animal level.

         <title>Nanocluster Surface Microenvironment Modulates Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic activity and product selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) depend strongly on the local microenvironment of mass diffusion at the nanostructured catalyst and electrolyte interface. Achieving a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the electrocatalytic reaction requires the development of tunable metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures with atomic precision, which is highly challenging. Here, we present the synthesis and molecular structure of a 25&#8208;atom silver nanocluster interfaced with an organic shell comprising 18 thiolate ligands. The locally induced hydrophobicity by bulky alkyl functionality near the surface of the Ag25 cluster dramatically enhances the eCO2RR activity (CO Faradaic efficiency, FECO: 90.3%) with higher CO partial current density (jCO) in a H&#8208;cell compared to Ag25 cluster (FECO: 66.6%) with confined hydrophilicity, which modulates surface interactions with water and CO2. Remarkably, the hydrophobic Ag25 cluster exhibits jCO as high as &#8208;240&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with FECO &gt;90% at &#8208;3.4&#160;V cell potential in a gas&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly device. Furthermore, this cluster demonstrates stable eCO2RR over 120&#160;h. Operando surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal how the ligands alter the neighboring water structure and *CO intermediates, impacting the intrinsic eCO2RR activity, which provides atomistic mechanistic insights into the crucial role of confined hydrophobicity.

Furthermore, this cluster demonstrates stable eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR over 120&#160;h. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal how the ligands alter the neighboring water structure and *CO intermediates, impacting the intrinsic eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity, which provides atomistic mechanistic insights into the crucial role of confined hydrophobicity.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The rapid progress in the development of COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines during the initial year of the pandemic has highlighted the significance of lipid nanoparticles in therapeutic delivery. Various lipid types have been investigated for the effective delivery of mRNA, each with unique functions and versatile applications. These range from their use in cancer immunotherapy and gene editing to their role in developing vaccines against infectious diseases. Nonetheless, continued exploration of novel lipids and synthetic approaches is necessary to further advance our understanding and expand our techniques for optimizing mRNA delivery. In this work, we facilely synthesized new lipids derived from FDA&#8208;approved soybean oil and employed them for efficient mRNA delivery. EGFP and Fluc mRNA were used to evaluate the delivery efficacy of our lipid formulations both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we observed organ&#8208;specific targeting capabilities in certain formulations, and we demonstrated their outstanding performance in delivering Cre mRNA for gene editing. These results showcase the potential of soybean oil&#8208;derived lipids in mRNA delivery, offering utility across a broad spectrum of bioapplications.

         <title>Cu@Co with Dilatation Strain for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a clean and sustainable strategy to simultaneously remove NO and synthesize NH3. However, the conversion of low concentration NO to NH3 is still a huge challenge. In this work, the dilatation strain between Cu and Co interface over Cu@Co catalyst is built up and investigated for electroreduction of low concentration NO (volume ratio of 1%) to NH3. The catalyst shows a high NH3 yield of 627.20&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 76.54%. Through the combination of spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and geometric phase analyses, it shows that Co atoms occupy Cu lattice sites to form dilatation strain in the xy direction within Co region. Further density functional theory calculations and NO temperature programmed desorption results show that the surface dilatation strain on Cu@Co is helpful to enhance the NO adsorption and reduce energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH), thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction. To simultaneously realize NO exhaust gas removal, NH3 green synthesis and electricity output, a Zn&#8208;NO battery with Cu@Co cathode is assembled with a power density of 3.08&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 273.37&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Thermal and Moisture Managing E&#8208;Textiles Enabled by Janus Hierarchical Gradient Honeycombs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Moisture and thermal comfort are critical for long&#8208;term wear. In recent years, there is a rapidly growing attention on the importance of comfortability of wearable electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles), particularly in the fields such as health monitoring, sports training, medical diagnostic and treatment, where long&#8208;term comfort is crucial. Nonetheless, simultaneously regulating thermal and moisture comfort for the human body without compromising electronic performance remains a significant challenge to date. Herein, we develop a thermal and moisture managing e&#8208;textile (TMME&#8208;textile) that integrates unidirectional water transport and daytime radiative cooling properties with highly sensitive sensing performance. The TMME&#8208;textile is made by patterning sensing electrodes on rationally designed Janus hierarchical gradient honeycombs that offer wetting gradient and optical management. The TMME&#8208;textile can unidirectionally pump excessive sweat, providing a dry and comfortable microenvironment for users. Moreover, it possesses high solar reflectivity (98.3%) and mid&#8208;infrared emissivity (89.2%), which reduce skin temperature by &#8764;7.0&#176;C under a solar intensity of 1&#160;kW m&#8722;2. The TMME&#8208;textile&#8208;based strain sensor displays high sensitivity (0.1749 kPa&#8722;1) and rapid response rate (170&#160;ms), effectively enabling smooth long&#8208;term monitoring, especially during high&#8208;intensity outdoor sports where thermal and moisture stresses are prominent challenges to conventional e&#8208;textiles.

         <title>Biomimetic Targeting Nanoadjuvants for Sonodynamic and Chronological Multi&#8208;Immunotherapy against Holistic Biofilm&#8208;Related Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work originates a chronological multi&#8208;immunotherapy combined with sonodynamic therapy against biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) based on macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated nanoadjuvants loaded with cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p for biofilm eradication under ultrasound. CPG&#8208;ODN promotes early&#8208;stage neutrophil extracellular trap formation while redirecting macrophage polarization. MiR&#8208;21&#8208;5p facilitates tissue integration and anti&#8208;inflammation in repairing phase. This approach offers valuable clinical benefits for BRIs&#8217; treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) present significant challenges owing to drug resistance, adverse immune responses, and implant failure; however, current approaches inadequately cater to the diverse therapeutic requirements at different stages of infection. To address this issue, a multi&#8208;immunotherapy strategy in combination with sonodynamic therapy is proposed for the chronological treatment of BRIs. Macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated targeting sonosensitive nanoadjuvants are fabricated to load cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or microRNA (miR)&#8208;21&#8208;5p. In the early stages of BRI (Stage I), CPG&#8208;ODN&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (CPG@HMPN@M) promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps to capture and neutralize detached microbes. During the late stage of infection (Stage II), CPG&#8208;ODNs redirect macrophage polarization into the M1 phase to combat infections via TLR9/Myd88/TRAF6 pathway. During these stages, CPG@HMPN@M generates singlet oxygen through sonodynamic processes, eradicating the biofilms under US irradiation. Once the BRIs are eliminated, miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (miR@HMPN@M) are delivered to the lesions to suppress excessive inflammation and promote tissue integration by evoking macrophage M2 polarization during the repair phase (Stage III) through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. This innovative approach aims to provide comprehensive treatment strategies for the chronological treatment of BRI by effectively eliminating infections, promoting tissue restoration, and implementing different immune regulations at different stages, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies towards such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Accelerated Confined Mass Transfer of MoS2 1D Nanotube in Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the high photogenerated electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency and the inherent mass transfer characteristics of MoS2 confined nanotubes, the photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery delivers a high power density (70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and obtains a Li&#8211;O2 battery with excellent rate performance, which fully proves the universality of this confined structure to achieve simple, efficient and fast photogenerated carrier separation dynamics.








Abstract
Applying solar energy into energy storage battery systems is challenging in achieving green and sustainable development, however, the efficient progress of photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes upon the photocathode. Herein, a 1D&#8208;ordered MoS2 nanotube (MoS2&#8208;ONT) with confined mass transfer can be used to extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, which is capable of overcoming the challenge of rapid recombination of electron and holes. The tubular confined space cannot only promote the orderly separation and migration of charge carriers but also realize the accumulation of charge and the rapid activation of oxygen molecules. The concave surface of MoS2&#8208;ONT can improve the carrier separation ability and prolong the carrier lifetime. Meanwhile, the ordered tubular confined space can effectively realize the rapid transfer of charge, ion, and oxygen. Under light irradiation, a fast oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of 70&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is achieved, which is the highest value reported for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries. Significantly, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery based on MoS2&#8208;ONT also shows superior rate capability and other exciting battery performance. This work shows the universality of the confined carrier separation strategy in photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Peeling&#8211;Stiffening Self&#8208;Adhesive Ionogel with Superhigh Interfacial Toughness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel with a working mechanism in stark contrast to conventional cured and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives is reported. The ionogel incorporates two ionophilic repeating units with different associating affinities, allowing it to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft liquid&#8208;like dissipating state, and upon peeling, to dramatically stiffen to a phase&#8208;separated glassy state for superstrong adhesion.








Abstract
Self&#8208;adhesive materials that can directly adhere to diverse solid surfaces are indispensable in modern life and technologies. However, it remains a challenge to develop self&#8208;adhesive materials with strong adhesion while maintaining its intrinsic softness for efficient tackiness. Here, a peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel that reconciles the seemingly contradictory properties of softness and strong adhesion is reported. The ionogel contains two ionophilic repeating units with distinct associating affinities, which allows to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft dissipating state for adhering, and to dramatically stiffen to the glassy state upon peeling. The corresponding modulus increases by 117 times driven by strain&#8208;rate&#8208;induced phase separation, which greatly suppresses crack propagation and results in a super high interfacial toughness of 8046 J m&#8722;2. The self&#8208;adhesive ionogel is also transparent, self&#8208;healable, recyclable, and can be easily removed by simple moisture treatment. This strategy provides a new way to design high&#8208;performance self&#8208;adhesive materials for intelligent soft devices.

         <title>Selective Shielding of the (002) Plane Enabling Vertically Oriented Zinc Plating for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of the (100) plane is realized by selective shielding of the (002) plane using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites hinders the future development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Despite that the (100) plane possesses better zincophilic ability and fast kinetics, dendrites are generally suppressed via (002) plane&#8208;oriented Zn deposition in previous reports; the ordered (100) plane&#8208;dominant Zn deposition, especially under high current density has not yet been realized. Herein, vertically&#8208;oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of (100) plane is reported using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. DLP is preferentially anchored on the Zn (002) crystal plane via the polar phosphate group, then the deposition of Zn atoms on the (002) plane is retarded by the long alkyl chain, finally promoting the preferred growth of the (100) plane. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell also cycles steadily for 700&#160;h with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides new insights into the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by crystal plane modulation.

         <title>Super&#8208;Structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>

         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;structured wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogel designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange and in situ photocuring procedures integrates ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.








Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel as dissipative layer and in situ photocuring technology for entangling quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;based wet&#8208;adhesive layer (PAAc&#8208;N+) with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, the hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

An injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogel (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is developed to capture Zn2+, alleviate local inflammation, scavenge ROS, inhibit glycolysis and chemotaxis, which are available to reprogram the microenvironment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and shrinking prostate especially after entrapping lonidamine.








Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the leading cause of urination disorder is still a refractory disease, and there have no satisfied drugs or treatment protocols yet. With identifying excessive Zn2+, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the etiology of aberrant hyperplasia, an injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogels (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation are developed to load lonidamine for reprogramming prostate microenvironment and treating BPH. Herein, SAGA hydrogels can crosslink with Zn2+ in BPH via coordination chelation and switch free Zn2+ to bound ones, consequently alleviating Zn2+&#8208;arisen inflammation and glycolysis. Beyond capturing Zn2+, GA with intrinsic immunoregulatory property can also alleviate local inflammation and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, Zn2+ chelation&#8208;bridged interconnection in SAGA enhances its mechanical property and regulates the degradation rate to enable continuous lonidamine release, favoring hyperplastic acini apoptosis and further inhibiting glycolysis. These multiple actions cooperatively reprogram BPH microenvironment to alleviate characteristic symptoms of BPH and shrink prostate. RNA sequencing reveals that chemotaxis, glycolysis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inflammation&#8208;related pathways associated with M1&#8208;like phenotype polarization are discerned as the action rationales of such endogenous Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ hydrogels, providing a candidate avenue to treat BPH.

         <title>Longevous Cycling of Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by &#8220;Raisin&#8208;Bread&#8221; Cobalt Oxynitride/Porous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts</title>

The design of &#8220;Raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture for bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst enables the Zn&#8208;air battery to exhibit a longevous cyclability exceeding 1350&#160;h. It is realized through synergistic combination of (i) cobalt oxynitride as the protective shell, (ii) defect&#8208;rich active sites resulting from in&#8208;situ nitridation and strong coupling between cobalt raisin and surrounding 3D conductive bread, and (iii) enhanced mass and charge transportation via the boosted active surface and porosity.








Abstract
Developing commercially viable electrocatalyst lies at the research hotspot of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, but it is still challenging to meet the requirements of energy efficiency and durability in realistic applications. Strategic material design is critical to addressing its drawbacks in terms of sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions and limited battery lifespan. Herein, a &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture is designed for a hybrid catalyst constituting cobalt nitride as the core nanoparticle with thin oxidized coverings, which is further deposited within porous carbon aerogel. Based on synchrotron&#8208;based characterizations, this hybrid provides oxygen vacancies and Co&#8208;Nx&#8208;C sites as the active sites, resulting from a strong coupling between CoOxNy nanoparticles and 3D conductive carbon scaffolds. Compared to the oxide reference, it performs enhanced stability in harsh electrocatalytic environments, highlighting the benefits of the oxynitride. Furthermore, the 3D conductive scaffolds improve charge/mass transportation and boost durability of these active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduced N species into hybrid can synergistically tune the d&#8208;band center of cobalt and improve its bifunctional activity. As a result, the obtained air cathode exhibits bifunctional overpotential of 0.65&#160;V and a battery lifetime exceeding 1350 h, which sets a new record for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery reported so far.

         <title>Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II Ratiometric Nanothermometers for 3D In Vivo Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometers with self&#8208;calibrating ability are constructed by assembling temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and temperature&#8208;sensitive Ag2S quantum dots into a hybrid nanocomposite material. The high thermal sensitivity, robust stability and calibration procedure enable accurate 3D thermographic imaging ex vivo and in vivo.








Abstract
Luminescent nanothermometry, particularly the one based on ratiometric, has sparked intense research for non&#8208;invasive in vivo or intracellular temperature mapping, empowering their uses as diagnosis tools in biomedicine. However, ratiometric detection still suffers from biased sensing induced by wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering, low thermal sensitivity (Sr), and lack of imaging depth information. Herein, this work constructs an ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometer with self&#8208;calibrating ability for 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, in which temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and strongly temperature&#8208;quenched Ag2S quantum dots are co&#8208;assembled to form a hybrid nanocomposite material. Precise control over the amount ratio between two sub&#8208;materials enables the manipulation of heat&#8208;activated back energy transfer from Ag2S to Yb3+ in lanthanide nanoparticles, thereby rendering Sr up to 7.8% &#176;C&#8722;1 at 43.5 &#176;C, and higher than 6.5% &#176;C&#8722;1 over the entire physiological temperature range. Moreover, the luminescence intensity ratio between two separated spectral regions within the narrow Yb3+ emission peak is used to determine the depth information of nanothermometers in living mice and correct the effect of tissue depth on 2D thermographic imaging, and therefore allows a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of accurate 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, constituting a solid step toward the development of advanced ratiometric nanothermometry for biological applications.

         <title>Confinement Engineering of Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Triggered Charge Redistribution on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a confinement strategy between atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped porous carbon and metal nanoparticles is presented, which can induce the strong electronic coupling with adjacent nanoparticles and tune their electrocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.








Abstract
Optimizing the interaction between metal and support in the supported metal catalysts effectively refines the electronic structure and boosts the catalytic properties of loaded active components. Herein a method is introduced to confine ultrafine ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles within atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped carbon network (Ru/Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) through the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction, achieving superior catalytic activity and stability for alkaline hydrogen evolution. Spectroscopic data and theoretical modeling elucidate that the remarkable catalytic performance of Ru sites stems from their strong electronic coupling with neighboring Zn&#8208;N4 moiety and pyridinic N/pyrrolic N. This interaction induces an electron&#8208;deficient state of Ru, thereby accelerating the dissociation of H2O and lowering the energy barriers for the desorption of OH* and H*. This insight provides a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at play. Furthermore, alkaline water electrolyzer using this catalyst as cathode delivers a mass activity of 3&#160;A&#160;mgcat&#8211;1 at 2.0&#160;V, much surpassing Ru&#8208;C. This research opens a novel pathway for the development of advanced materials , tailored for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Unconventional Synthesis of Hierarchically Twinned Copper as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrate&#8211;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is developed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical twin boundary networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. It is found that the HTBs can significantly promote the Cu&#8208;catalyzed reduction of nitrate to generate ammonia.








Abstract
Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites, and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, a surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is proposed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy, the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8211;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single&#8208;oriented TB and without TB. It is discovered that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO2*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and subsequent NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.

&lt;p&gt;Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal-based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites, and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, a surfactant-free and facile strategy is proposed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy, the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8211;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single-oriented TB and without TB. It is discovered that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and subsequent NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Solvent Engineered CsPbI2.77Br0.23 Ink for Large&#8208;Area and Scalable High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbI2.77I0.23 slot&#8208;die inks are developed via the colloidal engineering of scalable large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Eco&#8208;friendly solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and 2&#8208;methoxyethanol are used. Film growth is controlled by varying the solvent ratio. The cells based on films prepared by slot&#8208;die coating exhibit an efficiency of 19.05%.








Abstract
The performance of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been assessed for typical compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), using a blade coater, slot&#8208;die coater, solution shearing, ink&#8208;jet printing, and thermal evaporation. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films is not well developed. This study develops, for the first time, an eco&#8208;friendly solvent engineered all&#8208;inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile (ACN), 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME), or a mixture of ACN and 2&#8208;ME to fabricate large&#8208;area CsPbI2.77Br0.23 films with slot&#8208;die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50 &#176;C). The perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of prepared with different solvent ratios are thoroughly examined and they are correlated with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated CsPbI2.77Br0.23 perovskite film, which is prepared from the eco&#8208;friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile&#160;(0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintains &#8776;91% of its original PCE after 1 month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. It is believed that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Meta&#8208;Display: Photoluminescence and Pumping Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The originally proposed design strategy for light&#8208;emitting meta&#8208;display not only intriguingly enables simultaneous and independent encoding of fluorescence and pump light, but also expands encoding freedom of different incident wavevector directions. The design strategy, which extends the capability of light&#8208;emitting metasurface to meet diverse requirements, can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.








Abstract
The advent of intelligent display devices has given rise to diverse and complex demands for miniature light&#8208;emitting devices. Light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces have emerged as a practical and efficient means of achieving precise light modulation. However, their practicality is limited by certain constraints. First, there is a need for further exploration of the ability to manipulate both pumping and emitting light simultaneously. Second, there is currently no encoding freedom in multi&#8208;dimensional emitting light. To address these concerns, using meta&#8208;atoms is proposed to encode both fluorescence and pumping light independently, and expand the encoding freedom with different incident wavevector directions. A light&#8208;emitting metasurface with quad&#8208;fold multiplex encoding meta&#8208;displays, including dual scattering images and dual fluorescence images, is further demonstrated. This design strategy not only manipulates both pumping and fluorescence light but also broadens encoding freedom for comprehensive multi&#8208;functionality. This can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Layered Perovskite Coated with In Situ Exsolved Core&#8208;Shell CuFe@FeOx Nanoparticles for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a new SOEC cathode material is reported for CO2 electrolysis, composed of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in both the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate and the FeOx shell facilitates the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE&#8208;PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeOx shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO2 into CO, reducing CO2 emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here a new SOEC cathode is reported for CO2 electrolysis consisting of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe alloy@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN&#8208;CFA@FeO cathode exhibit a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 for CO2 reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200 h under 0.75 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO2. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeOx shell, in contrast to conventional in situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB), thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

         <title>Enhanced Quasi&#8208;Fermi Level Splitting of Perovskite Solar Cells by Universal Dual&#8208;Functional Polymer</title>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have attracted extensive attention due to their higher power conversion efficiency and simple fabrication process. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss remains&#160;a&#160;significant impediment to enhance&#160;device performance. Here, we demonstrate a facile strategy to boost the VOC to 95.5% of the Shockley&#8208;Queisser (S&#8208;Q) limit through the introduction of a universal multifunctional polymer additive. This&#160;additive&#160;effectively passivates the cation and anion defects simultaneously, thereby leading to the transformation from the strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type of perovskite films. Benefitting from the energy level alignment and the suppression of bulk non&#8208;radiative recombination, the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) is enhanced. &#160;Consequently, the champion devices with 1.59&#160;eV&#8208;based perovskite reached a highest VOC value of 1.24&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.86%. Furthermore, this strategy boosts the VOC by at least 0.07&#160;V across five different perovskite systems and a PCE of 25.04% was achieved for 1.57&#160;eV&#8208;based PSCs, the corresponding module (14 cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 21.95%. This work provides an effective and universal strategy to promote the VOC approach to the detailed balance theoretical limit.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Printing of Flow&#8208;inspired Anisotropic Patterns with Liquid Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anisotropic materials formed by living organisms possess remarkable mechanical properties due to their intricate microstructure and directional freedom. In contrast, human&#8208;made materials face challenges in achieving similar levels of directionality due to material constraints and manufacturability. To overcome these limitations, we present an approach using 3D printing of self&#8208;assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCP). The remarkably high stiffness of the LCP is granted by the alignment of nematic domains within the polymer during extrusion. The Young's modulus ranging from 3&#160;GPa to 40&#160;GPa was found to be strongly influenced by the directionality of the nematic flow. By determining a relationship between stiffness, nozzle diameter and line width, we identify a suitable design space where shaping and mechanical performance can be combined. We demonstrate the ability to print LCPs with on&#8208;the&#8208;fly width changes to accommodate arbitrary spatially varying directions. This enables us to manufacture exquisite patterns inspired by fluid dynamics with steep curvature variations. The versatility of LCPs combined with this approach allows to 3D&#8208;print functional objects with gradients of stiffness and curvatures, offering potential applications in lightweight functional structures embedding crack&#8208;mitigation strategies. This method also opens avenues for studying and replicating intricate patterns observed in nature, such as wood or turbulent flow using extrusion 3D printing.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries for Extreme Temperature Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With increasing energy storage demands across various applications, reliable batteries capable of performing in harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures, are crucial. However, current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exhibit limitations in both low and high&#8208;temperature performance, restricting their use in critical fields like defense, military, and aerospace. These challenges stem from the narrow operational temperature range and safety concerns of existing electrolyte systems. To enable LIBs to function effectively under extreme temperatures, the optimization and design of novel electrolytes are essential. Given the urgency for LIBs operating in extreme temperatures and the notable progress in this research field, a comprehensive and timely review is imperative. This article presents an overview of challenges associated with extreme temperature applications and strategies used to design electrolytes with enhanced performance. Additionally, we emphasize the significance of understanding underlying electrolyte behavior mechanisms and the role of different electrolyte components in determining battery performance. Lastly, we discuss future research directions and perspectives on electrolyte design for LIBs under extreme temperatures. Overall, this article offers valuable insights into the development of electrolytes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries capable of reliable operation in extreme conditions.

         <title>Nanoscale Operando Characterization of Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Reveals Charge Transport Bottlenecks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Charge transport in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) is governed by the microstructural property of the semiconducting thin film that is in direct contact with the electrolyte. Therefore, a comprehensive nanoscale operando characterization of the active channel is crucial to pinpoint various charge transport bottlenecks for rational and targeted optimization of the devices. In this work, we systematically probe the local electrical properties of EGOFETs by in&#8208;liquid Scanning Dielectric Microscopy (in&#8208;liquid SDM) and provide a direct picture of their functional mechanism at the nanoscale across all operational regimes, starting from sub&#8208;threshold, linear to saturation, until the onset of pinch&#8208;off. To this end, we introduce a robust interpretation framework of in&#8208;liquid SDM that enables quantitative local electric potential mapping directly from raw experimental data without requiring calibration or numerical simulations. Based on this development, we perform a straightforward nanoscale assessment of various charge transport bottlenecks, like contact access resistances, inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;domain charge transport, microstructural inhomogeneities and conduction anisotropy, which were inaccessible earlier. Present results contribute to the fundamental understanding of charge transport in electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors and promote the development of direct structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships to guide future design rules.

         <title>Composite Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Organic&#8208;Inorganic Interface Engineering for Fast Ion Transport in Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSE) are a promising candidate for addressing the limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes. However, different ion transport capacities between liquid solvents and polymers can cause localized heterogeneous distribution of Na+ fluxes. In addition, the continuous side reactions occurring at the interface between QSSE and sodium anode lead to uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a novel strategy is designed to integrate the composite electrospun membrane of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSPO) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) into QSSE, aiming to introduce new fast ion conducting channels at the organic&#8208;inorganic interface. The efficient ion transfer pathways can effectively promote the homogenization of ion migration, enabling composite quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (CQSSE) to achieve an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.1 mS cm&#8722;1 at room&#8208;temperature, with a Na+ transference number as high as 0.54. Moreover, the PVDF&#8208;HFP is preferentially reduced upon contact with the sodium anode to form a &#8220;NaF&#8208;rich&#8221; solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the growth of dendrites. The synergistic combination of multiple strategies can realize exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability in both sodium symmetric batteries (&#8764;700&#160;h) and full batteries (2100 cycles). This study provides a new insight for constructing high performance and dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs).

         <title>Single Atom Iridium Decorated Nickel Alloys Supported on Segregated MoO2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hetero&#8208;interface engineering has been widely employed to develop supported multi&#8208;component catalysts for water electrolysis, but it still remains a substantial challenge for supported single atom alloys. Herein we report a conductive oxide MoO2 supported Ir1Ni single atom alloys (Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs) bifunctional electrocatalysts through surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction, where the Ir atoms are atomically anchored onto the surface of Ni nanoclusters via the Ir&#8208;Ni coordination accompanied with electron transfer from Ni to Ir. Benefiting from the unique structure, the Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs not only exhibit low overpotential of 48.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 19&#160;mV/dec for hydrogen evolution reaction, but also show highly efficient alkaline water oxidation with overpotential of 280&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA/cm2. Their overall water electrolysis exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.52&#160;V at 10&#160;mA/cm2 and excellent durability. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8208;Ni interface effectively weakens hydrogen binding energy, and decoration of the Ir single atoms boost surface reconstruction of Ni species to enhance the coverage of intermediates (OH*) and switch the potential&#8208;determining step. We suggest that this approach opens up a promising avenue to design efficient and durable precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetero-interface engineering has been widely employed to develop supported multi-component catalysts for water electrolysis, but it still remains a substantial challenge for supported single atom alloys. Herein we report a conductive oxide MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supported Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni single atom alloys (Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni@MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SAAs) bifunctional electrocatalysts through surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction, where the Ir atoms are atomically anchored onto the surface of Ni nanoclusters via the Ir-Ni coordination accompanied with electron transfer from Ni to Ir. Benefiting from the unique structure, the Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni@MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SAAs not only exhibit low overpotential of 48.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Tafel slope of 19&#160;mV/dec for hydrogen evolution reaction, but also show highly efficient alkaline water oxidation with overpotential of 280&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Their overall water electrolysis exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.52&#160;V at 10&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent durability.

         <title>Nerve Visualization using Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores to Guide Prostatectomy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying nerves during prostatectomy poses a significant challenge due to their small size, translucency, and narrowness of the pelvis. To address this issue, a library of nerve&#8208;specific fluorophores based on a phenoxazine scaffold has been developed. Formulated derivatives have been shown to be compatible with the robotic&#8208;assisted da Vinci system, allowing for high&#8208;fidelity imaging of prostatic nerves during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery (FGS) is poised to revolutionize surgical medicine through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores for tissue&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific contrast. Clinical open and laparoscopic FGS vision systems operate nearly exclusively at NIR wavelengths. However, tissue&#8208;specific NIR contrast agents compatible with clinically available imaging systems are lacking, leaving nerve tissue identification during prostatectomy a persistent challenge. Here, it is shown that combining drug&#8208;like molecular design concepts and fluorophore chemistry enabled the production of a library of NIR phenoxazine&#8208;based fluorophores for intraoperative nerve&#8208;specific imaging. The lead candidate readily delineated prostatic nerves in the canine and iliac plexus in the swine using the clinical da Vinci Surgical System that has been popularized for minimally invasive prostatectomy procedures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of molecular engineering of NIR nerve&#8208;binding fluorophores for ready integration into the existing surgical workflow, paving the path for clinical translation to reduce morbidity from nerve injury for prostate cancer patients.

         <title>A Sodiophilic Amyloid Fibril Modified Separator for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite separator is fabricated through the vacuum filtration technique, which incorporates a unique amyloid fibril onto a glass&#8208;fiber separator. The composite separator demonstrates remarkable efficacy in suppressing the growth of sodium dendrites due to the formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase film enriched with nitride, which showcases its potential as a promising solution in sodium&#8208;battery technology.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) batteries are being considered as prospective candidates for the next generation of secondary batteries in contrast to lithium&#8208;based batteries, due to their high raw&#8208;material abundance, low cost, and sustainability. However, the unfavorable growth of Na&#8208;metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a vacuum filtration strategy, through amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified glass&#8208;fiber separators, is proposed to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800&#160;h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na&#8208;based electrodes under an ester&#8208;based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both the experimental and the theoretical results show that the sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes the electric field and Na&#8208;ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na3N&#8208; and NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve the dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmentally friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.

         <title>Advances in Polymer Dielectrics with High Energy Storage Performance by Designing Electric Charge Trap Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric capacitors have been developed for nearly a century, and all&#8208;polymer film capacitors are currently the most popular. Much effort has been devoted to studying polymer dielectric capacitors and improving their capacitive performance, but their high conductivity and capacitance losses under high electric fields or elevated temperatures are still significant challenges. Although many review articles have reported various strategies to address these problems, to the best of our knowledge, no review article has summarized the recent progress in the high&#8208;energy storage performance of polymer&#8208;based dielectric films with electric charge trap structures. Therefore, this paper first reviews the charge trap characterization methods for polymeric dielectrics and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. The research progress on the design of charge trap structures in polymer dielectric films, including molecular chain optimization, organic doping, blending modification, inorganic doping, multilayered structures, and the mechanisms of the charge trap&#8208;induced enhancement of the capacitive performance of polymers are systematically reviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook on the fundamental theory of charge trap regulation, performance characterization, numerical calculations, and engineering applications are presented. This review provides a valuable reference for improving the insulation and energy storage performance of dielectric capacitive films.

         <title>Versatile Structural Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enabling Switchable Catalytic Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The structure engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) forms the cornerstone of their applications. Nonetheless, realizing the simultaneous versatile structure engineering of MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a dynamically mediated synthesis strategy to simultaneously engineer the crystal structure, defect structure, and nanostructure of MOFs. These include amorphous Zr&#8208;ODB nanoparticles, crystalline Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz (ODB = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxalyldibenzoate, hz = hydrazine) nanosheets, and defective d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz nanosheets. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM) combined with low&#8208;dose high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) imaging technique vividly portrays these engineered structures. Concurrently, the introduced hydrazine moieties confer self&#8208;reduction properties to the respective MOF structures, allowing the in&#8208;situ installation of catalytic Pd nanoparticles. Remarkably, in the hydrogenation of vanillin&#8208;like biomass&#8208;derivatives, Pd/Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz yields partially hydrogenated alcohols as the primary products, whereas Pd/d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz exclusively produces fully hydrogenated alkanes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, coupled with experimental evidence, uncover the catalytic selectivity switch triggered by the change in structure type. The proposed strategy of versatile structure engineering of MOFs introduces an innovative pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions.

         <title>&#8220;Spark&#8221; PtMnIr Nanozymes for Electrodynamic&#8208;Boosted Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes capable of efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cellular homeostasis disruption are highly pursued for cancer therapy. However, it still faces challenges from the complicate tumor microenvironment (TME) and high chance for tumor metastasis. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed PtMnIr nanozymes are designed with multiple enzymatic activities, including catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which continuously produce ROS and deplete glutathione (GSH) concurrently in an &#8220;inner catalytic loop&#8221; way. With the help of electrodynamic stimulus, highly active &#8220;spark&#8221; species (Ir3+ and Mn3+) have been significantly increased, resulting in an effective cascade enzymatic and electrodynamic therapy. Moreover, the cyclic generation of ROS can also facilitate ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor cells, boosting synergistic therapy. Importantly, lung metastasis inhibition is found which confirmed efficient immunotherapy by the combined effect of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and Mn2+&#8208;induced cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, contributing great potential in the treatment of malignant tumors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multienzyme-mimicking redox nanozymes capable of efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cellular homeostasis disruption are highly pursued for cancer therapy. However, it still faces challenges from the complicate tumor microenvironment (TME) and high chance for tumor metastasis. Herein, well-dispersed PtMnIr nanozymes are designed with multiple enzymatic activities, including catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which continuously produce ROS and deplete glutathione (GSH) concurrently in an &#8220;inner catalytic loop&#8221; way. With the help of electrodynamic stimulus, highly active &#8220;spark&#8221; species (Ir&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) have been significantly increased, resulting in an effective cascade enzymatic and electrodynamic therapy. Moreover, the cyclic generation of ROS can also facilitate ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor cells, boosting synergistic therapy. Importantly, lung metastasis inhibition is found which confirmed efficient immunotherapy by the combined effect of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, contributing great potential in the treatment of malignant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few 2D materials have been experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under the varying strain. Here, we observe a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus nanosheets, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which has been reported in few other 2D materials in our knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 meV/% and &#8208;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials towards optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

         <title>Nucleation Regulation and Mesoscopic Dielectric Screening in &#913;&#8208;Fapbi3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While significant advancements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been made, attaining controllable perovskite crystallization is still a considerable hurdle. This challenge stems from the initial formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, a more energetically stable phase than the desired black &#945;&#8208;phase, during film deposition. This disrupts the heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, causing the formation of mixed phases and defects. To this end, we introduced polarity engineering using molecular additives, specifically (methyl&#8208;sulfonyl)phenyl)ethylamines (MSPEs). Our findings reveal that the interaction of PbI2&#8208;MSPEs&#8208;FAI intermediates is enhanced with the increased polarity of MSPEs, which in turn expedites the nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This leads to the development of high&#8208;quality &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films, characterized by vertical crystal orientation and reduced residual stresses. Additionally, the increased dipole moment of MSPE at perovskite grain boundaries attenuates Coulomb attractions among charged defects and screens carrier capture process, thereby diminishing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Utilizing these mechanisms, PSCs treated with highly polar 2&#8208;(4&#8208;MSPE) achieve an impressive PCE of 25.2% in small&#8208;area devices and 20.5% in large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with an active area of 70 cm2. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy in achieving controllable crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, paving the way for scalable&#8208;production of high&#8208;efficiency PSMs.

         <title>Negative Enthalpy Variation Drives Rapid Recovery in Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The mechanism behind the resilience of polymeric materials, typically attributed to the well&#8208;established entropy elasticity, often ignores the contribution of enthalpy variation (&#916;H), because it based on the assumption of an ideal chain. However, this model does not fully account for the reduced resilience of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) during long&#8208;range deformation, which is mainly caused by the dynamics of physical crosslink networks. Such reduction is undesirable for long&#8208;range stretchable TPU considering its wide application range. Therefore, a negative &#916;H effect is established in this work to facilitates instant recovery in long&#8208;range stretchable TPU, achieved by constructing a reversible interim interface via strain&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the newly constructed dual soft segmental TPU shows resilience efficiency exceeding 95%, surpassing many synthetic high&#8208;performance TPUs with typical efficiencies below 80%, and comparable to biomaterials. Moreover, a remarkable hysteresis loop with a ratio exceeding 50%, making it a viable candidate for applications such as artificial ligaments or buffer belts. The research also clarifies structural factors influencing resilience, including the symmetry of the dual soft segments and the content of hard segments, offering valuable insights for the design of highly resilient long&#8208;range stretchable elastomers.

Abstract
Screening asymptomatic organisms (humans, animals, plants) with a high&#8208;diagnostic accuracy using point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;testing (POCT) technologies, though still visionary holds great potential. Convenient surveillance requires easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, cost&#8208;effective, ultra&#8208;portable but highly reliable, in&#8208;vitro&#8208;diagnostic devices that are ready for use wherever they are needed. Currently, there are not yet such devices available on the market, but there are a couple more promising technologies developed at readiness&#8208;level 5: the Clustered&#8208;Regularly&#8208;Interspaced&#8208;Short&#8208;Palindromic&#8208;Repeats/CRISPR lateral&#8208;flow&#8208;strip tests and the Single&#8208;Molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;Transistor/SiMoT bioelectronic palmar devices. They both hold key features delineated by the World&#8208;Health&#8208;Organization for POCT systems and show an occurrence of false&#8208;positive and false&#8208;negative errors &lt;1&#8208;5% resulting in diagnostic&#8208;selectivity and sensitivity &gt;95&#8208;99%, while limit&#8208;of&#8208;detections are of few markers. CRISPR&#8208;strip is a molecular assay that, combined with enzymatic amplification, can detect down to few copies of DNA/RNA markers in blood while SiMoT immunometric and molecular test can detect down to a single oligonucleotide, protein marker, or pathogens in 0.1&#160;mL of blood, saliva, and olive&#8208;sap. These technologies can prospectively enable the systematic and reliable surveillance of asymptomatic ones prior to worsening/proliferation of illnesses allowing for timely diagnosis and swift prognosis. This could establish a proactive healthcare ecosystem that results in effective treatments for all living organisms generating diffuse and well&#8208;being at efficient costs.

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte Induced Bilayer Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries with 100&#160;&#176;C Wide&#8208;Temperature Range</title>

         <dc:description>
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in harsh environments. A new&#8208;type hydrated eutectic electrolyte is developed to in situ form a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase, thereby improving the reversibility of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) encounters challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in battery performance under harsh environments. Here, a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O, ethylene glycol (EG), and InCl3 solution is introduced to effectively extend the lifespan of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the H2O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual&#8208;interaction, involving coordination with Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques reveal that HEE in situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation&#8208;reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase are further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.

Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual-interaction, involving coordination with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo-transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques reveal that HEE in situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation-reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase are further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Subcutaneous Administration of a Zwitterionic Chitosan&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Controlled Spatiotemporal Release of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel is developed using chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA, enabling the repurposing of sterile monoclonal antibodies formulations designed for intravenous administration as tunable subcutaneous (SC) formulations. This hydrogel has demonstrated biodegradability, biocompatibility, and controlled release properties in mice and nonhuman primates, offering rapid translation to human use and potential for clinical development of SC biosimilars.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient compliance. The current FDA&#8208;/EMA&#8208;approved enzymatic approach, utilizing recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) to enhance mAbs SC delivery, involves degrading the extracellular matrix's hyaluronate to increase tissue permeability. However, this method lacks tunable release properties, requiring individual optimization for each mAb. Seeking alternatives, physical polysaccharide hydrogels emerge as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical and biodegradability features. Unfortunately, none have demonstrated simultaneous biocompatibility, biodegradability, and controlled release properties for large proteins (&#8805;150&#160;kDa) after SC delivery in clinical settings. Here, a novel two&#8208;component hydrogel comprising chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA is introduced that can be seamlessly mixed with sterile mAbs formulations initially designed for intravenous (IV) administration, repurposing them as novel tunable SC formulations. Validated in mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with various mAbs, including trastuzumab and rituximab, the hydrogel exhibited biodegradability and biocompatibility features. Pharmacokinetic studies in both species demonstrated tunable controlled release, surpassing the capabilities of rHuPH20, with comparable parameters to the rHuPH20+mAbs formulation. These findings signify the potential for rapid translation to human applications, opening avenues for the clinical development of this novel SC biosimilar formulation.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage in Tungsten Bronze Dielectric Ceramics Through a Weakly Coupled Relaxor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining high energy storage performance in tetragonal tungsten bronze dielectric ceramics is challenging, owing to the complexity of composition design and crystal structure. This study focuses on enhancing the recoverable energy density in Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8722;1.5xSmxNb2O6 by creating weakly coupled polar nanoregions. The resulting system exhibits ultrahigh energy storage, surpassing the majority of counterparts in ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze structures.








Abstract
Dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, known for their ultrafast discharge time and high&#8208;power density, find widespread applications in high&#8208;power pulse devices. However, ceramics featuring a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure (TTBs) have received limited attention due to their lower energy&#8208;storage capacity compared to perovskite counterparts. Herein, a TTBs relaxor ferroelectric ceramic based on the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8208;1.5xSmxNb2O6 composition, exhibiting an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 9 J cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 84% under an electric field of 660&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 is reported. Notably, the energy storage performance of this ceramic shows remarkable stability against frequency, temperature, and cycling electric field. The introduction of Sm3+ doping is found to create weakly coupled polar nanoregions in the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485Nb2O6 ceramic. Structural characterizations reveal that the incommensurability parameter increases with higher Sm3+ content, indicative of a highly disordered A&#8208;site structure. Simultaneously, the breakdown strength is also enhanced by raising the conduction activation energy, widening the bandgap, and reducing the electric field&#8208;induced strain. This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs&#8208;based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high&#8208;power pulse device applications.

         <title>Microstructured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer&#8208;Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities and Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microstructured leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer is synthesized for ionotronic sensors, achieving a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1 and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. The broad sensing range of the sensor within the high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. A wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors are highly demanded for artificial tactile sensing. Using ionic conductors as the dielectric layer has enabled ionotronic pressure sensors with high sensitivities owing to giant capacitance of the electric double layer (EDL) formed at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface. However, conventional ionotronic sensors suffer from leakage, which greatly hinders long&#8208;term stability and practical applications. Herein, a leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer as the dielectric layer for ionotronic sensors is synthesized. The mechanical and electrical properties of the polyelectrolyte elastomer are optimized, a micropyramid array is constructed, and it is used as the dielectric layer for an ionotronic pressure sensor with marked performances. The obtained sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1, a high upper detecting limit on the order of 1&#160;MPa, a fast response/recovery speed of &#8776;6&#160;ms, and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. Notably, the sensor retains a high sensitivity of 4.96 kPa&#8722;1 at 500&#160;kPa, and its broad sensing range within high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. The applications of the sensor as a wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated. Durable and highly sensitive ionotronic sensors potentialize high&#8208;performance artificial skins for soft robots, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and beyond.

         <title>Understanding and Utilizing Droplet Impact on Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Phenomena, Mechanisms, Regulations, Applications, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of small droplets on nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces make invaluable contributions to the big world. This review summarizes the phenomena and mechanisms of droplet impact dynamics, demonstrates the regulation strategies using surface engineering, and discusses their utilization in diverse applications. Understanding and utilizing droplet impact is of vital significance for illuminating a sustainable future.








Abstract
Droplet impact is a ubiquitous liquid behavior that closely tied to human life and production, making indispensable impacts on the big world. Nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces provide a powerful platform for regulating droplet impact dynamics. The collision between classic phenomena of droplet impact and the advanced manufacture of superhydrophobic surfaces is lighting up the future. Accurately understanding, predicting, and tailoring droplet dynamic behaviors on superhydrophobic surfaces are progressive steps to integrate the droplet impact into versatile applications and further improve the efficiency. In this review, the progress on phenomena, mechanisms, regulations, and applications of droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces, bridging the gap between droplet impact, superhydrophobic surfaces, and engineering applications are comprehensively summarized. It is highlighted that droplet contact and rebound are two focal points, and their fundamentals and dynamic regulations on elaborately designed superhydrophobic surfaces are discussed in detail. For the first time, diverse applications are classified into four categories according to the requirements for droplet contact and rebound. The remaining challenges are also pointed out and future directions to trigger subsequent research on droplet impact from both scientific and applied perspectives are outlined. The review is expected to provide a general framework for understanding and utilizing droplet impact.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active&#8208;transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant negative capacitance response is directly observed in the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium. When compared to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics, molecular ferroelectrics, in which order&#8211;disorder transition of the molecular induces the occurrence of polarization, would have a smaller ferroelectric anisotropy parameter &#945; and a larger domain wall formation energy.








Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the NC in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, the focus is centered on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II), and a pioneering investigation on their NC responses is conducted. The findings demonstrate that the NC exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Intelligent Delivery Systems in Tumor Metabolism Regulation: Exploring the Path Ahead</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latest advancements in intelligent drug delivery systems (DDS) exhibit distinctive advantages, including precise sensing, programmability, feedback control, and intrinsic activity. These attributes render them conducive to facilitating multi&#8208;dimensional therapeutic approaches grounded in metabolic regulation.








Abstract
Cancer metabolism plays multifaceted roles in the initiation and progression of tumors, and interventions in metabolism are considered fundamental approaches for cancer control. Within the vast metabolic networks of tumors, there exist numerous potential therapeutic targets, intricately interconnected with each other and with signaling networks related to immunity, metastasis, drug resistance, and more. Based on the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, constructing drug delivery systems for multi&#8208;level modulation of the tumor microenvironment is proven as an effective strategy for achieving multidimensional control of cancer. Consequently, this article summarizes several features of tumor metabolism to provide insights into recent advancements in intelligent drug delivery systems for achieving multi&#8208;level regulation of the metabolic microenvironment in cancer, with the aim of offering a novel paradigm for cancer treatment.

         <title>Thermal Disorder&#8208;Induced Strain and Carrier Localization Activate Reverse Halide Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) over light&#8208;induced strain can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient responsible for segregation. Simultaneously, dynamic disorder&#8208;inducing polaron localization significantly reduces excess carrier density, thereby mitigating the impact of light&#8208;induced strain. As a result, entropy dominates the system's free energy. These insights highlight the importance of strain homogenization for stable&#8208;phase, mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.








Abstract
The reversal of halide ions is studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localization of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) can be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice can mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder is estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#160;&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain is 0.23%. However, in situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increases the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

         <title>Design Criteria for Nanostructured Carbon Materials as Solid Contacts for Ion&#8208;Selective Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;selective microsensor arrays and wearable sensor patches require stable potentials for long&#8208;term continuous measurements. Good stability can be achieved with nanostructured carbon materials with the appropriate structure, pore architecture, and composition as solid contacts. Recommendations regarding the selection of carbon solid contacts and considerations for their characterization and testing in solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes are provided in this Perspective.








Abstract
The ability to miniaturize ion&#8208;selective sensors that enable microsensor arrays and wearable sensor patches for ion detection in environmental or biological samples requires all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sensors with solid contacts for transduction of an ion activity into an electrical signal. Nanostructured carbon materials function as effective solid contacts for this purpose. They can also contribute to improved potential signal stability, reducing the need for frequent sensor calibration. In this Perspective, the structural features of various carbon&#8208;based solid contacts described in the literature and their respective abilities to reduce potential drift during long&#8208;term, continuous measurements are compared. These carbon materials include nanoporous carbons with various architectures, carbon nanotubes, carbon black, graphene, and graphite&#8208;based solid contacts. The effects of accessibility of ionophores, ionic sites, and other components of an ion&#8208;selective membrane to the internal or external carbon surfaces are discussed, because this impacts double&#8208;layer capacitance and potential drift. The effects of carbon composition on water&#8208;layer formation are also considered, which is another contributor to potential drift during long&#8208;term measurements. Recommendations regarding the selection of solid contacts and considerations for their characterization and testing in solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes are provided.

         <title>Dielectric Filler&#8208;induced Hybrid Interphase Enabling Robust Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries at High Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The fillers in composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte are mainly responsible for the enhancement of the conduction of Li ions but barely regulate the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a unique filler of dielectric NaNbO3 for the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte, which is subjected to the exchange of Li+ and Na+ during cycling, and the substituted Na+ is engaged in the construction of a fluorinated Li/Na hybrid SEI with high Young's modulus, facilitating the fast transport of Li+ at the interface at a high areal capacity and suppressing the Li dendrite growth. The dielectric NaNbO3 also induces the generation of high&#8208;dielectric &#946; phase of PVDF to promote the dissociation of Li salt. The Li/Li symmetrical cell exhibits a long&#8208;term dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 600&#160;h at a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li solid&#8208;state cells with NaNbO3 stably cycle 2200 times at 2C and that paired with high&#8208;loading cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle for 150 times and exhibit excellent performances at &#8208;20&#176;C. This work provides a novel design principle of fillers undertaking interfacial engineering in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes for developing the safe and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery.

         <title>Robust Organogel Scintillator for Self&#8208;healing and Ultra&#8208;flexible X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide scintillators serve as promising candidates for X&#8208;ray detection due to their high attenuation coefficients, high light yields, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processable characteristics. However, the issues of humidity/thermal quenching and mechanical fragility, remain obstacles to the broad and diversified development of metal halide scintillators. Here we report a lead&#8208;free, water&#8208;stable, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing (ethylenebis&#8208;triphenylphosphonium manganese (II) bromide (C38H34P2)MnBr4 organogel scintillator that meets X&#8208;ray imaging in complex scenarios. The robust organogel scintillator can be stretched with elongation up to 1300% while maintaining the scintillation properties. Activated by the dynamic hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds design, the organogel scintillator exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties at room temperature to alleviate the vignetting problem of the rigid scintillator films, the X&#8208;ray imaging resolution can reach 16.7 lp mm&#8722;1. The organogel scintillator can also realize flexible and self&#8208;healing X&#8208;ray imaging in water, providing a design path for portable devices in harsh conditions.

         <title>Title Personalized cancer nanomedicine: Overcoming biological barriers for intracellular delivery of biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. The review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.

         <title>Phase&#8208;pure &#913;&#8208;Fapbi3 Perovskite Solar Cells via Activating Lead&#8208;Iodine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Narrow bandgap cubic formamidine perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) has been widely studied for its potential to achieve record&#8209;breaking efficiency. However, its high preparation difficulty caused by lattice instability has been criticized. A popular strategy for stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 lattice is to replace intrinsic FA+ or I&#8722; with smaller ions of MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;, whereas this generally leads to broadened optical bandgap and phase separation. Studies show that ions substitution&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 can achieve intrinsic phase stability. However, the challenging preparation of high&#8208;quality films has hindered its further development. Here, we report a facile synthesis of high&#8208;quality MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film by a new solution modification strategy. This enables the activation of lead&#8208;iodine (Pb&#8208;I) frameworks by forming the coated Pb&#183;&#183;&#183;O network, thus simultaneously promoting spontaneous homogeneous nucleation and rapid phase transition from &#948; to &#945; phase. As a result, the efficient and stable phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSC was obtained through a one&#8208;step method without antisolvent treatment, with a record efficiency of 23.15% and excellent long&#8208;term operating stability for 500 hours under continuous light stress.

         <title>A High&#8208;Q Electric&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Magnetic Coupled Resonator for Elf/Slf Cross&#8208;Medium Magnetic Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Extremely/super low frequency (ELF/SLF) electromagnetic wave could effectively propagate in the harsh cross&#8208;medium environment where a high&#8208;frequency electromagnetic wave cannot pass due to the fast&#8208;decay. For efficiently transmitting a strong ELF/SLF radiation signal, the traditional electromagnetic antenna requires a super&#8208;large loop (&gt;10&#160;km). To address this issue, in this work, we report a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam&#8208;type electric&#8208;mechano&#8208;magnetic (EMM) coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross&#8208;medium magnetic communication. Through designing hard&#8208;soft hybrid step&#8208;stiffness elastic beam, the resonator exhibits a much higher quality factor Q (&#8764; 240) for ELF/SLF magnetic field transmitting, which is one to five orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported mechanical antennas and loop coil antennas. Moreover, the resonator exhibits a 5000 times higher magnetic field emitting efficiency compared to a conventional loop coil antenna in ELF/SLF band. It also demonstrates a 200% increase in magnetic field emitting capacity compared to existing piezoelectric&#8208;driven antennas. Additionally, an ASK+PSK modulation method is proposed for suppressing relaxation time of the resonator, and a reduction in the relaxation time by 80% is observed. Furthermore, an air&#8208;seawater cross&#8208;medium magnetic field communication was successful demonstrated, indicating its potential as portable, high&#8208;efficient antenna for underwater and underground communications.

&lt;p&gt;Extremely/super low frequency (ELF/SLF) electromagnetic wave could effectively propagate in the harsh cross-medium environment where a high-frequency electromagnetic wave cannot pass due to the fast-decay. For efficiently transmitting a strong ELF/SLF radiation signal, the traditional electromagnetic antenna requires a super-large loop (&amp;gt;10&#160;km). To address this issue, in this work, we report a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam-type electric-mechano-magnetic (EMM) coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross-medium magnetic communication. Through designing hard-soft hybrid step-stiffness elastic beam, the resonator exhibits a much higher quality factor Q (&#8764; 240) for ELF/SLF magnetic field transmitting, which is one to five orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported mechanical antennas and loop coil antennas.

         <title>A Fiber Sensor for Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Extracellular Potassium Ion Fluctuations in Chronic Neuropsychiatric Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The extracellular potassium ion concentration in the brain exerts a significant influence on cellular excitability and intercellular communication. Perturbations in the extracellular potassium ion level are closely correlated with various chronic neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. However, a critical gap persists in performing real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring of extracellular potassium ions, which is necessary for comprehensive profiling of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, a fiber potassium ion sensor (FKS) that consists of a soft conductive fiber with a rough surface and a hydrophobic&#8208;treated transduction layer interfaced with a potassium ion&#8208;selective membrane has been found to solve this problem. The FKS demonstrates stable interfaces between its distinct functional layers in an aqueous environment, conferring an exceptional stability of 6 months in vivo, in stark contrast to previous reports with working durations from hours to days. Upon implantation into the mouse brain, the FKS enables effective monitoring of extracellular potassium ion dynamics under diverse physiological states, including anesthesia, forced swimming and tail suspension. Using this FKS, we achieve tracking of extracellular potassium ion fluctuations that align with behaviors associated with the progression of depression over months, demonstrating its usability in studying chronic neuropsychiatric disorders from a new biochemical perspective.

However, there are few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from 1st January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing in since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.

         <title>Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lotus effect, a universal strategy is proposed for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. The effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism is demonstrated by designing the metal&#8211;organometallic compound layer with zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property, in which in situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic groups are constructed.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as an example, this work illustrates how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on the Zn metal anode. In situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups are constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which improves the electrochemical performance of the Zn||V2O5 full cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with water contact angle (CA) measurements demonstrate that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water CA and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how the excellent reversibility is achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIB anodes.

         <title>Magnetic Aggregation&#8208;Induced Bone&#8208;Targeting Nanocarrier with Effects of Piezo1 Activation and Osteogenic&#8211;Angiogenic Coupling for Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance in bone homeostasis, is a global health concern. Bone defects are difficult to heal in patients with osteoporosis. Classical drug treatments for osteoporotic bone defects have unsatisfactory efficacy owing to side effects and imprecise delivery problems. In this study, a magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced bone&#8208;targeting poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid, PLGA)&#8208;based nanocarrier (ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO) is synthesized to realize dual&#8208;targeted delivery and precise Piezo1&#8208;activated therapy for osteoporotic bone defects. Piezo1 is an important mechanotransducer that plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis. To achieve dual&#8208;targeting properties, ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO is fabricated using zoledronate (ZOL)&#8208;decorated PLGA, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), and Piezo1&#8208;activated molecule Yoda1 via the emulsion solvent diffusion method. Bone&#8208;targeting molecular mediation and magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced properties can jointly and effectively achieve precise delivery to localized bone defects. Moreover, Yoda1 loading enables targeted and efficient mimicking of mechanical signals and activation of Piezo1. Experiments in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO can activate Piezo1 in bone defect areas of osteoporotic mice, improve osteogenesis through YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis, promote a well&#8208;coordinated osteogenesis&#8211;angiogenesis coupling, and significantly accelerate bone reconstruction within the defects without noticeable side effects. Overall, this novel dual&#8208;targeting nanocarrier provides a potentially effective strategy for the clinical treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.

         <title>Harmonizing Thickness And Permeability in Bone Tissue Engineering: A Novel Silk Fibroin Membrane Inspired by Spider Silk Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) gathers significant interest in the realm of bone tissue engineering; however, the interplay between membrane thickness and permeability continues to pose a challenge which can be addressed by the water&#8208;collecting mechanism of spider silk, where water droplets efficiently move from smooth filaments to rough conical nodules. Inspired by the natural design of spider silk, we develop an innovative silk fibroin membrane featuring directional fluid transportation via harmoniously integrating a smooth, dense layer with a rough, loose layer; conical microchannels are engineered in the smooth and compact layer. Consequently, double&#8208;layered membrane with cone&#8208;shaped microporous passageways (CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane) are designed for in situ bone repair. Through extensive in vitro testing, we note that the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane guides liquid flow from the the compact layer's surface to the loose layer, enabling rapid diffusion. Remarkably, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane demonstrate superior mechanical properties, resistance to bacterial adhesion. When apply in vivo, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane achieve results on par with the commercial Bio&#8208;Gide collagen membranes. This innovative integration of a cross&#8208;thickness wetting gradient structure offers a novel solution, harmonizing the often conflicting requirements of material transport, mechanical strength, and barrier effectiveness, while also addressing issues relate to tissue engineering scaffold perfusion.

Abstract
The development of facile, efficient synthesis method to construct low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important, yet still challenging. Herein, we report an atomically dispersed N, S co&#8208;doped carbon with abundant vacancy defects (NSC&#8208;vd) anchored Fe single atoms (SAs) derived from coal pitch by an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy and propose a vacancy defects inductive effect based on asymmetrically coordinated Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst for promoting electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized catalyst featured of stable Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites exhibits high ORR activity with turnover frequency (18.5 and 2.87 s&#8722;1) and mass activity (56.2 and 15.9 A mg&#8722;1), which are 132 and 11, 312 and 42 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C at 0.87 and 0.74&#160;V in 0.1&#160;M KOH and 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, respectively. In&#8208;situ Raman and attenuated total reflectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveal the Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites are beneficial to the generation of OH&#8722; species and exhibits different kinetic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline solutions. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the ORR activity of Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst in different electrolyte is closely related to the coordination structure. The Fe&#8208;N coordination is major contributor as active site for O2 adsorption&#8208;activation in 0.1&#160;M KOH, while the Fe&#8208;S coordination is main active center for ORR in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Theoretical calculation reveals that the upshifted d band center of Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites facilitate the adsorption of O2 and accelerate the kinetics process of *OH reduction. The abundant vacancy defects around the Fe&#8208;N3S1 active sites balance the OOH* formation and *OH reduction, thus synergetic promoting the electrocatalytic ORR process. This work proposes a novel controllable synthesis method and structural regulation strategy of SACs for high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic ORR in energy conversion devices.

         <title>Recycling and Reusing of Graphite from Retired Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The proliferation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) over the past decade has led to a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) powered by these batteries reaching the end of their lifespan. With retired EVs becoming more prevalent, the recycling and reuse of their components, particularly graphite, has become imperative as the world transitions towards electric mobility. Graphite constitutes approximately 20% of LIBs by weight, making it a valuable resource to be conserved. This review presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of the current global graphite mining landscape and explores potential opportunities for the &#8220;second life&#8221; of graphite originating from depleted LIBs. Various existing recycling and reactivation technologies in both industry and academia are discussed, along with potential applications for the recycled graphite. Understanding these processes is crucial as they form a vital aspect of the waste management hierarchy. Furthermore, this review addresses the future challenges faced by the recycling industry in dealing with expired LIBs, encompassing environmental, economic, legal, and regulatory considerations. These challenges must be carefully examined to ensure sustainable and responsible recycling practices. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments in recycling and reusing graphite from retired LIBs, offering valuable insights for forthcoming large&#8208;scale recycling efforts. It emphasizes the need to consider individual perspectives and align efforts towards an efficient and environmentally friendly recycling strategy, essential for the continued growth of electric mobility.

         <title>CTL&#8208;inspired Killing System Using Ultralow&#8208;dose Chemical&#8208;drugs to Induce A Pyroptosis&#8208;mediated Antitumour Immune Function</title>

Abstract
A Cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;inspired system capable of using ultralow&#8208;dose chemical drugs to manipulate cell death is needed to investigate the antitumour immunotherapy. Recent studies revealed pyroptosis, a type of immunogenic cell death, could promote antitumour immune function. However, high&#8208;dose chemotherapy led to cytokine release syndrome by pyroptosis. Therefore, pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy was potential in preclinical and clinical research, but its efficacy, safety and the antitumour immune responses were not clear. Here, we established a near&#8208;infrared light controllable killing system (BIK system) by which ultralow&#8208;dose doxorubicin could be spatiotemporally transported to immunosuppressive tumour cells and mediate efficient pyroptosis. Compared with using DOX directly, the BIK system reduced total drug consumption to less than one&#8208;thirtieth the common dose in vitro. MPI imaging and fluorescence imaging showed our BIK system exhibited good tumour targeting and tumour penetration. We applied this system for pyroptosis&#8208;induced antitumor therapies, and the results showed that less than c.a. 25&#160;&#956;g kg&#8722;1 DOX was sufficient for GSDME&#8208;positive tumour regression with negligible injuries to major organs. Moreover, the gasdermin&#8208;deficient 4T1 tumours could be controlled by combining BIK system with decitabine treatment. The antitumour immune function were proven to correlate with the impressive efficacy of pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy, and the concomitant immune memory prevented metastasis. Compare to pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy, the boost in T&#8208;cell infiltration after high&#8208;dose DOX treatment was relative weak, and it failed to improve immunosuppression and block lung metastases. Owing to the robust antitumour immune function induced by BIK system, advanced&#8208;stage bulky tumours could be controlled or shrunken by synergizing with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy. This study provided new insights into the design of nanoassisted systems for activating the antitumour immune function by microstimulation; our application of the BIK system suggested that ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy was sufficient for inducing a robust pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumour immune function.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sleek High Entropy Alloy Tights: Realizing Superior Cyclability for Anode&#8208;Free Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of Li&#8208;free anodes to inhibit Li dendrite formation and provide high energy density Li batteries is highly applauded. However, the lithiophobic interphase and heterogeneous Li deposition hindered the practical application. In this work, a 20&#160;nm ultra&#8208;sleek high entropy alloy (HEA, NiCdCuInZn) tights w ere developed by a thermodynamically driven phase transition method. Multiple Li+ transport paths and abundant active sites are enabled by the cocktail effect of different constituent elements in HEA. These active sites with gradient absorption energies (&#8208;3.18&#8764;&#8208;2.03&#160;eV) facilitate selective binding, providing a low barrier for homogeneous Li nucleation. Simultaneously, multiple transport paths promote Li diffusion behavior with uniform Li deposition. Thus, the HEA/C achieves high reversibility of Li plating/stripping processes over 2000 cycles with a CE of 99.6% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, as well as over 7200&#160;h at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/60 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Moreover, the full cell with the HEA/C host without Li metal and a high&#8208;loading (17.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM&#8208;811 cathode has an average CE of 99.5% at 1 C after 160 cycles. This advanced HEA structure design shows a favorable potential application for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and proposes a variety of design principles. Various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively and systematically summarized to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs for lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively summarized and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs are provided. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI is discussed and corresponding design principles are proposed, which are beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>Distinguished Roles of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Sp2 And Sp3 Hybridized Carbon on Extraordinary Supercapacitance in Acidic Aqueous Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
The acidic aqueous supercapacitors have been found to deliver appealing capacitive properties due to fast ion diffusion caused by the applied smallest size of hydrion. However, their practical applications are largely inhibited by the narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23&#160;V). Herein, we report a nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbon, consisting of varied nitrogen doping bonded on sp2 and sp3 carbon sites, which are capable of stimulating a wider potential window up to 1.4&#160;V and thus resulting in a great enhancement of capacitive performance in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Together with the improved electrical conductivity and preferable hydrion diffusion, the as&#8208;prepared nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbon materials (RNOPCs) exhibit an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (1084 F cm&#8722;3) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Besides, a fully packed RNOPCs&#8208;based symmetrical supercapacitor can deliver a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 31.8&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 and 54.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 respectively, approaching those of lead acid batteries (25&#8208;35&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1). The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the lone pair electrons of the doped nitrogen can be delocalized on its neighboring carbon atoms, improving charge uptakes and overpotentials. Such facile and scale&#8208;up production of carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors can bridge the gap of energy density between traditional supercapacitors and batteries in aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Microwave Phosphine&#8208;plasma Assisted Ultrafast Synthesis of Halogen&#8208;doped Ru/RuP2 with Surface Intermediate Adsorption Modulation for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anionic modification engineering is a crucial approach to develop highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, halogen elements (X = Cl, Br, and I) modified Ru&#8208;based nanosheets (X&#8208;Ru/RuP2) is designed by rapid and eco&#8208;friendly microwave&#8208;phosphide plasma approach within 60 s. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the introduced halogen element, especially Br, could optimize the surface intermediates adsorption. Specially, the designed Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 favors the water dissociation and following hydrogen adsorption/desorption process. Then, the as&#8208;synthesized Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 exhibits low overpotential of 34&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 27&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the electrocatalytic performances in acid and neutral media are also boosted via Br element modification. This work paves a novel way to regulate the electronic structure of Ru&#8208;based compounds, and then can boost the electrocatalytic kinetics.

         <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;N1S2 Sites via Chemical Vapor Deposition to Boost Enzyme&#8208;Like Activity for Efficient Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with well&#8208;defined and uniform atomic structures, are an emerging type of natural enzyme mimics. Currently, it is important but challenging to rationally design high&#8208;performance SAzymes and deeply reveal the interaction mechanism between SAzymes and substrate molecules. Herein, we reported the controllable fabrication of a unique Cu&#8722;N1S2&#8208;centred SAzyme (Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C) via a chemical vapor deposition&#8208;based sulfur&#8208;engineering strategy. Benefiting from the optimized geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom sites, Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme shows boosted enzyme&#8208;like activity, especially in catalase&#8208;like activity, with a 13.8&#8208;fold increase in the affinity to H2O2 substrate and a 65.2&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency when compared to Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C SAzyme with Cu&#8722;N3 sites. Further theoretical studies reveal that the increased electron density around single&#8208;atom Cu is achieved through electron redistribution, and the efficient charge transfer between Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C and H2O2 is demonstrated to be more beneficial for the adsorption and activation of H2O2. The as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme possesses an excellent antitumor effect through the synergy of catalytic therapy and oxygen&#8208;dependent phototherapy. This study provides a strategy for the rational design of SAzymes, and the proposed electron redistribution and charge transfer mechanism will help to understand the coordination environment effect of single&#8208;atom metal sites on H2O2&#8208;mediated enzyme&#8208;like catalytic processes.

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, we propose a microrobotic superstructure, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). Our superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, we showcase the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which could be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Engineering the Dielectric Constants of Polymers: From Molecular to Mesoscopic Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymers are essential components of modern&#8208;day materials and are widely used in various fields. The dielectric constant, a key physical parameter, plays a fundamental role in the light&#8208;, electricity&#8208;, and magnetism&#8208;related applications of polymers, such as dielectric and electrical insulation, battery and photovoltaic fabrication, sensing and electrical contact, and signal transmission and communication. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to engineering the intrinsic dielectric constant of polymers, particularly by tailoring the induced and orientational polarization modes and ferroelectric domain engineering. Investigations into these methods have guided the rational design and on&#8208;demand preparation of polymers with desired dielectric constants. This review article exhaustively summarizes the dielectric constant engineering of polymers from molecular to mesoscopic scales, with emphasis on application&#8208;driven design and on&#8208;demand polymer synthesis rooted in polymer chemistry principles. Additionally, it explores the key polymer applications that can benefit from dielectric constant regulation and outlines the future prospects of this field.

Abstract
The most successful lithium&#8208;ion batterie (LIBs) based on ethylene carbonate(EC) electrolytes and graphite anodes still suffer from severe energy and power loss at temperatures below &#8208;20&#176;C, which is because of high viscosity or even solidification of electrolytes, sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Li+ at the electrode surface, and slow Li+ transportation in solid electrolyte interphase(SEI). Here we engineered a coherent lithium phosphide(Li3P) coating firmly bonding to the graphite surface to effectively address these challenges. The dense, continuous, and robust Li3P interphase with high ionic conductivity enhances Li+ transportation across the SEI. Plus, it promotes Li+ de&#8208;solvation through an electron transfer mechanism, which simultaneously accelerates the charge transport kinetics and stands against the co&#8208;intercalation of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point solvent molecules, such as propylene carbonate(PC), 1,3&#8208;dioxolane(DOL), and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane(DME). Consequently, we achieved an unprecedented combination of high&#8208;capacity retention and fast&#8208;charging ability for LIBs at low temperatures. In full cells encompassing the Li3P&#8208;coated graphite anode and PC electrolytes, an impressive 70% of their room&#8208;temperature capacity was attained at &#8208;20&#176;C with a 4C charging rate and a 65% capacity retention was achieved at &#8208;40&#176;C with a 0.05C charging rate. This research pioneers a transformative trajectory in fortifying LIB performance in cryogenic environments.

&lt;p&gt;The most successful lithium-ion batterie (LIBs) based on ethylene carbonate(EC) electrolytes and graphite anodes still suffer from severe energy and power loss at temperatures below -20&#176;C, which is because of high viscosity or even solidification of electrolytes, sluggish de-solvation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the electrode surface, and slow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transportation in solid electrolyte interphase(SEI).

         <title>Thorough Optimization for Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) with a high efficiency is of significance for practical application. However, their efficiencies lag far behind those of rigid or even flexible counterparts. To address this issue, we design and fabricate an advanced top&#8208;illuminated OPV, which is intrinsically stretchable and has a high performance, through systematic optimizations from material to device. First, the stretchability of the active layer was largely increased by adding a low&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus elastomer of styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;propylene&#8208;styrene tri&#8208;block copolymer (SEPS). Second, the stretchability and conductivity of the opaque electrode were enhanced by a conductive polymer/metal (denoted as M&#8208;PH1000@Ag) composite electrode strategy. Third, the optical and electrical properties of a Ag nanowire transparent electrode were improved by a solvent vapor annealing strategy. We successfully fabricated high&#8208;performance is&#8208;OPVs with a top&#8208;illuminated structure, which provided a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.23%. Additionally, by incorporating 5&#8211;10% elastomer, we achieved a balance between the efficiency and stretchability of the is&#8208;OPVs. This study provides valuable insights into material and device optimizations for high&#8208;efficiency is&#8208;OPVs, with a low&#8208;cost production and excellent stretchability, which indicates a high potential for future applications of OPVs.

         <title>Continuous Melt Spinning of Covalently Cross&#8208;Linked Self&#8208;Healing Ionogel Fibers for Multi&#8208;Functional Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stretchable conductive fibers play key roles in electronic textiles, which have substantial improvements in terms of flexibility, breathability, and comfort. Compared to most existing electron&#8208;conductive fibers, ion&#8208;conductive fibers are usually soft, stretchable, and transparent, leading to increasing attention. However, the integration of desirable functions including high transparency, stretchability, conductivity, solvent resistance, self&#8208;healing ability, processability, and recyclability remains a challenge to be addressed. In the current research, we proposed a new molecular strategy based on dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking networks to enable continuous melt spinning of the ionogel fiber with the aforementioned properties. As a proof of concept, covalently cross&#8208;linked ionogel fibers based on dimethylglyoximeurethane (DOU) groups (DOU&#8208;IG fiber) were prepared. The resultant DOU&#8208;IG fiber exhibited high transparency (&gt; 93%), tensile strength (0.76&#160;MPa), stretchability (784%), and solvent resistance. Owing to the dynamic of DOU groups, the DOU&#8208;IG fiber showed high healing performance using near&#8208;infrared light. Taking advantage of DOU&#8208;IG fibers, multifunctional ionotronics with the integration of several desirable functionalities including sensor, triboelectric nanogenerator, and electroluminescent display were fabricated and used for motion monitoring, energy harvesting, and human&#8208;machine interaction. It is believed that these DOU&#8208;IG fibers are promising for fabricating the next generation of electronic textiles and other wearable electronics.

         <title>Significance of Engineering The MnO6 Octahedral Units to Promote The Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electronic structure and geometric configuration of catalysts play a crucial role to design novel perovskite&#8208;type catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nowadays, many studies are more concerned with the influence of electronic structure and ignore the geometric effect, which plays a nonnegligible role in enhancing catalytic performances. Herein, we regulate the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree of LaMnO3 by modulating the concentration of Y3+, excluding the electronic effect from the valence state of manganese. Plotting the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree as a function of concentration of Y3+ produces a volcano&#8208;shaped plot. The octahedral tilting can reduce the Mn&#8722;O covalency, generating more highly active Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies during ORR process. The specific activity has a positive correlation with octahedral tilting degree. Meanwhile, the octahedral tilting stabilizes Mn&#8722;O interactions during ORR process and promote stability. Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, octahedral tilting alters the rate&#8208;determining step and decrease the energy barrier. Subsequent extended experiment confirmed that octahedral tilting is the key factor to affect the catalytic performances.

         <title>A Novel Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast, reversible, and low&#8208;power manipulation of the spin texture is crucial for next generation spintronic devices like non&#8208;volatile bipolar memories, switchable spin current injectors or spin field effect transistors. Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) are the ideal class of materials for the realization of such devices. Their ferroelectric character enables an electronic control of the Rashba&#8208;type spin texture by means of the reversible and switchable polarization. Yet, only very few materials have been established to belong to this class of multifunctional materials. Here, Pb1&#8208;xGexTe is unraveled as a novel FERSC system down to nanoscale. The ferroelectric phase transition and concomitant lattice distortion is demonstrated by temperature dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its effect on electronic properties are measured by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In few nanometer&#8208;thick epitaxial heterostructures, a large Rashba spin&#8208;splitting is exhibiting a wide tuning range as a function of temperature and Ge content. Our work defines Pb1&#8208;xGexTe as a high&#8208;potential FERSC system for spintronic applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on-site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on-site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on-site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi-detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor-treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell-entry receptors conjugated to N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi-detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi-screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO&#8208;4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7&#8208;Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor&#8208;dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top&#8208;electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low&#8208;bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPVs with limited PTB7&#8208;Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8&#8208;series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.

         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin within 2D Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D sub&#8208;nanoconfined annealed graphene oxide membranes are constructed for efficient synthesis of aspirin in directional flow. The reaction shows &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented short reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculation indicates the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure plays an important role in the efficient reaction.








Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Roughness&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Biodegradable Zn Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) solves the dilemma of significantly improving plasticity at the expense of strength. From the unground state to the 5000# sandpaper ground state, room&#8208;temperature elongation of biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy increases from 74% to 143% without loss of strength. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness.








Abstract
Improving plasticity has been an eternal theme of developing metallic materials. It is difficult to increase room&#8208;temperature elongation of metallic materials over 100% without sacrificing strength using existing methods. Herein, surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) is discovered in biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy. Surprisingly, in the good surface range that meets the international standard ISO 6892, reducing surface roughness results in significant increase in plasticity without loss of strength. From unground to 5000# sandpaper ground states, the surface roughness Ra of the alloy decreases from 0.63 to 0.05&#160;&#181;m, while its room temperature elongation increases from 74% to 143%. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness. It provides a new method for improving plasticity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Stretchable Sensor Arrays Exhibiting Magnetoelasticity for Real&#8208;Time Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor based on a flexible NdFeB magnet to realize a wearable and self&#8208;powered sensor is reported, which provides open prospects for real&#8208;time gesture interaction based on an electromagnetic generator and is expected to achieve a wide range of future applications for intuitive and natural human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are highly desirable for human motion monitoring, and can be used to build new forms of bionic robots. However, the current use of flexible strain gauges is hindered by the need for an external power supply, and the demand for long&#8208;term operation. Here, a new flexible self&#8208;powered strain sensor system based on an electromagnetic generator that possesses a high stretchability in excess of 150%, a short response time of 30&#160;ms, and an excellent linearity (R2&#160;&gt; 0.98), is presented. Based on this new form of sensor, a human&#8211;machine interaction system is designed to achieve remote control of a robot hand and vehicle using a human hand, which provides a new scheme for real&#8208;time gesture interaction.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of B4C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B4C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B4C.








Abstract
The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B4C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

     alt="In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atomic structure of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state-of-the-art aberration-corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, composed of B&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;C icosahedra connected by boron-deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined by state-of-the-art aberration-corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Negative&#8208;Charge&#8208;Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, lightweight, durable, and low&#8208;cost current collector, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) film, is achieved for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. A large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups are incorporated onto the surface of the MXene film to form rich negative charges region on its surface, which shields the positive electrode material from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation in its &#8220;dead zone.&#8221;








Abstract
Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large&#8208;sized AlCl4&#8722; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative&#8208;charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times. It is believed that the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultralow Coercivity via an Amorphous&#8211;Nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in an FeCo&#8208;Based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative compositional design concept enables the construction of a unique transitional microstructure between traditional amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, which results in an alloy with an unprecedented combination of exceptionally high saturation magnetic flux density (Bs&#160;= 1.94 T) and ultralow coercivity (Hc&#160;= 4.3 A m&#8722;1), breaking the general trade&#8208;off between Bs and Hc in the soft&#8208;magnetic&#8208;material family.








Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in the soft magnetic material family. Here, superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8722;1 are unprecedentedly combined in an FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5 nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipoles, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of the next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;efficiency, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides opening the black box of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N) doping in graphdiyne, the relationship between N configurations and reaction routes in CO2 reduction is clarified. The sp&#8208;N atoms would induce high selectivity toward CH4 generation, owing to the optimized adsorption of precursor and intermediate. This work would guide the site&#8208;defined doping in carbon materials for advanced catalysts.








Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site&#8208;defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule is realized, and finally sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 toward CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.








Abstract
The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn&#8208;rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni3Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.

     alt="Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn-rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) material is reported, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated. The enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability and long cycling life.








Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) is designed and synthesized, by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated. Compared with phenazine monomer, it is revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and an extremely long cycle life of 45&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Investigation of the charge&#8208;storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge&#8208;storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Controllable Gold Nanocluster&#8211;Emulsion Interface for Direct Cell Penetration and Photothermal Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed tailorable amphiphilic gold nanoclusters facilitate the dynamic formation of emulsions by engaging in interfacial coupling, which enhances emulsion stability and nanocluster photophysical performance. The segregated interfacial microdomains of nanoclusters on the emulsion surface determine their biointerfacial interactions and allow them to directly penetrate cell membranes. The developed functional emulsions are well suited for multifluorescence tracing and photothermal killing.








Abstract
In the view of their ability to be uptaken by cells, colloidal particles can exert diverse physiological effects and are promising vehicles for the intracellular delivery of biologically active substances. Given that the modulation of biomaterial interfaces greatly facilitates the prediction and control of the corresponding cellular responses, the interfacial behavior of hydrophobic dye&#8208;modified gold (Au) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is rationally designed to develop Au NC&#8208;containing emulsions and control their biointerfacial interactions with cell membranes. The observed biological performance is indicative of a physical penetration mechanism. The amphiphilic Au NCs decrease the interfacial energy of two immiscible liquids and hinder droplet coalescence to facilitate the formation of emulsions thermodynamically stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the amphiphilic Au NCs are localized on the emulsion droplet surface and form segregated interfacial microdomains that adapt to the membrane structure and facilitate the traverse of the emulsions across the cell membrane via direct penetration. Fast penetration coupled with excellent photophysical performance endows the emulsions with multifluorescence tracing and efficient photothermal killing capabilities. The successful change of the interaction mode between NCs and biological objects and the provision of a universal formulation to modulate biointerfacial interactions are expected to inspire new bioapplications.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals, progress, and prospects of vacancy engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward electrocatalytic applications are reviewed. Vacancy manufacturing strategies, characterization techniques, and unique roles in electrocatalysis are considered, and the evolution of vacancy configuration from aggregated to atomic distribution is comprehensively discussed. The lifetime dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations of vacancy&#8208;mediated electrocatalysts are also highlighted.








Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) toward the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D&#8208;TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization, and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulting catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy&#8208;engineering&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigates their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>Powder Metallurgy Route to Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Refractory Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sintering refractory metals/alloys to high density while maintaining fine microstructure is of paramount importance to ensure their applications. A comprehensive understanding of the sintering issues and microstructural design rules is discussed. Powder metallurgy advances in specific materials systems, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), and refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites are reviewed.








Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear energy, and many others under extreme environments. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well&#8208;controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules, and PM practices towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals are sought to be provided. The previous efforts shall be reviewed to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nanopowders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense UFG refractory metals down to &#8776;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys, and their composites. Last, future developments and the endeavor towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptionally uniform microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear energy, and many others under extreme environments. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well-controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near-net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules, and PM practices towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals are sought to be provided. The previous efforts shall be reviewed to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nanopowders, second-phase grain growth inhibitors, and field-assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two-step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense UFG refractory metals down to &#8776;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W-Re), refractory high-entropy alloys, and their composites. Last, future developments and the endeavor towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptionally uniform microstructure and improved properties are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid interfaces play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of solid&#8208;state batteries. This review provides an overview on the solid&#8211;solid interfaces from aspects of structural features, Li&#8208;ion transport, interfacial contact, and electro&#8208;chemical reactions. The existing interface issues and improvement strategies are discussed. Opportunities and future trends on the investigation and optimization of these interfaces are highlighted.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8211;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this review, the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors are discussed. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8211;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed By In Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of in situ and environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and recent advances in structure dynamics of nanocrystals are reviewed. The nucleation and growth of nanocrystals, structure dynamics, and structure evolution under reaction conditions are discussed in detail. The methodologies and challenges of in situ TEM are also proposed.








Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM, reveal insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in situ electron microscopy, a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions are given. In the nucleation and growth part, existing nucleation theories and growth pathways are organized based on liquid and gas&#8211;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, the focus is on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, solid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere are discussed and the structure&#8211;property relationship is correlated. Even though impressive progress is made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>P&#8208;Type 2D Semiconductors for Future Electronics</title>

2D semiconductors represent one of the most promising candidates to extend Moore's law. However, their full potential has been greatly hindered by the limited p&#8208;type ones with high performance and stability. This review offers a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals, current status, and outlook of p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors, aiming to inspire relevant research for advanced future electronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors represent one of the best candidates to extend Moore's law for their superiorities, such as keeping high carrier mobility and remarkable gate&#8208;control capability at atomic thickness. Complementary transistors and van der Waals junctions are critical in realizing 2D semiconductors&#8208;based integrated circuits suitable for future electronics. N&#8208;type 2D semiconductors have been reported predominantly for the strong electron doping caused by interfacial charge impurities and internal structural defects. By contrast, superior and reliable p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors with holes as majority carriers are still scarce. Not only that, but some critical issues have not been adequately addressed, including their controlled synthesis in wafer size and high quality, defect and carrier modulation, optimization of interface and contact, and application in high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power integrated devices. Here the material toolkit, synthesis strategies, device basics, and digital electronics closely related to p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors are reviewed. Their opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future electronic applications are also discussed, which would be promising or even shining in the post&#8208;Moore era.

Although research on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials has been booming for decades, more research is needed on how to utilize them to construct efficient information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. A review of recent representative studies on information sensing, processing, and feedback devices based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials to provide a perspective on developing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technologies is presented.








Abstract
A wide variety of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with excellent properties can meet almost all the requirements of functional materials for information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. Low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are becoming the star of hope on the road to pursuing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions, benefiting from the breakthroughs in precise preparation, performance regulation, structural design, and device construction in recent years. This review summarizes several types of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials commonly used in human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions and outlines the differences in properties and application areas of different materials. According to the sequence of information flow in the human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing interaction process, the representative research progress of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials&#8208;based information sensing, processing, and feedback devices is reviewed and the key roles played by low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are discussed.

         <title>Van der Waals&#8208;Interface&#8208;Dominated All&#8208;2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional silicon&#8208;based devices, the unique features of all&#8208;2D electronics are atomic flatness and dangling&#8208;bond van der Waals interfaces, including all&#8208;2D metal/semiconductor, all&#8208;2D semiconductor/semiconductor, and all&#8208;2D dielectric/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces provide an excellent device platform for removing lattice matching constraints, suppressing carrier scattering, and exploiting new physical effects.








Abstract
The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon&#8208;based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin 2D materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short&#8208;channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high&#8208;quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all&#8208;2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all&#8208;2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, the unique properties of all&#8208;2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods are systematically reviewed and the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics are summarized, respectively.

     alt="Van der Waals-Interface-Dominated All-2D Electronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with traditional silicon-based devices, the unique features of all-2D electronics are atomic flatness and dangling-bond van der Waals interfaces, including all-2D metal/semiconductor, all-2D semiconductor/semiconductor, and all-2D dielectric/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces provide an excellent device platform for removing lattice matching constraints, suppressing carrier scattering, and exploiting new physical effects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon-based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin 2D materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short-channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high-quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all-2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all-2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, the unique properties of all-2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods are systematically reviewed and the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics are summarized, respectively. Finally, the recent progress and challenges for all-2D vdW electronics are discussed, and how to improve the compatibility of 2D material devices with silicon-based industrial technology is pointed out as a critical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on why implementing a membrane&#8208;based electrolyte is the priority for mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries and identifies critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide electrolyte membrane. The challenges and associated strategies for achieving these criteria in terms of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration are systematically analyzed and summarized.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>Communicating Supraparticles to Enable Perceptual, Information&#8208;Providing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e., (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized information providing additives, is presented. Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli&#8208;recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is obtained on demand.








Abstract
Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials. Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of considering materials as passive objects and turning them into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. This matter is capable of communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand. Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter by integrating customizable (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized communicating supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli&#8208;susceptible. Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli&#8208;recorder features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof, in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>Efficient Surfactant&#8208;Mediated Photovoltaic Manipulation of fL&#8208;Scale Aqueous Microdroplets for Diverse Optofluidic Applications on LiNbO3 Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is reported. The merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets and the microdroplet&#8208;assisted coupling of focused laser beams are demonstrated. Moreover, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved by leveraging the selective permeability of droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets.








Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation is proposed, where the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8211;oil and oil&#8211;Lithium niobate&#160;interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#181;W&#8208;level laser in oil media. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position is realized and the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings are demonstrated. To demonstrate its potential in photonic Micro&#8208;Electro&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;System assemblies, the end coupling of a focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface is demonstrated. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode characteristics.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors report a facile and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of pyrochlore iron (III) hydroxy fluoride (Pyr&#8208;IHF), enabling to produce Pyr&#8208;IHF at a low cost. Pyr&#8208;IHF&#8208;containing cathodes show superior capacity retention of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities, and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high costs of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8211;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of the Gelated Tumor Interstitium around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;Targeting for Precise and Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma protein&#8208;like nanomedicine p(EK&#8208;co&#8208;C&#8208;SPA&#8208;ss&#8208;Dox) is developed to enable the integration of all&#8208;barrier&#8208;penetration with active targeting in a single nanodelivery system. Moreover, it is revealed both mechanisms: liquification of surrounding gelated water molecules by zwitterionic p(EK) shell to overcome diffusion barrier in polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor&#160;interstitium, and pH&#8208;triggered targeting to GD2&#8208;overexpressed solid tumor by a negative&#8208;biased zwitterionic shell of nanomedicine.








Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine is developed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to five times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over ten times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil by more than three times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <title>Flexible Optoelectronic Multimodal Proximity/Pressure/Temperature Sensors with Low Signal Interference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensors are proposed by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous structure. Self&#8208;decoupled sensing of proximity/pressure/temperature is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics. Negligible signal interference opens up promising paths for multimodal tactile sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity, and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithms hinder the actual applications. Here, this work reports a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibits a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7% &#176;C&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among colloidal quantum wells, self&#8208;assembled of the layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95% is successfully realized. Incorporation of the novel hole transfer layer PF8Cz effectively suppresses electron leakage, which leads to the high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.9%.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, is limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) are demonstrated. Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37% is successfully spin&#8208;coated. The devices exhibit a remarkable peak EQE of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55&#160;754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15&#160;000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. The work is expected to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate&#8208;based multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs.

&lt;p&gt;Multicolor micro-texture-based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; space-selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro-scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro-scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro-scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high-performance anti-counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate-based multi-dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro-texture-based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare-earth ion (RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) space-selective doping and bionic micro-texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and height information of unclonable micro-texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro-scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro-scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro-scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high-performance anti-counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; space-selective doping and micro-texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Adsorption and Proton Chemistry of Ultra&#8208;Stabilized Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Manganese Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural stability strategy is proposed to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 in Zn&#8208;based aqueous devices and provide atomic insights. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism of proton chemistry and Zn ion surface adsorption in CoxMnO2 is revealed. Moreover, the mechanism of the influence of the anode selection on the surface adsorption process is studied.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zinc (Zn) batteries incorporating MnO2 cathodes possess favorable sustainability properties and are being considered for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, unstable electrode structures and unclear charge storage mechanisms limit their development. Here, advanced transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculations are utilized to study the working mechanisms of a Zn/MnO2 battery with a Co2+&#8208;stabilized, tunnel&#8208;structured &#945;&#8208;MnO2 cathode (CoxMnO2). It is shown that Co2+ can be pre&#8208;intercalated into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 and occupy the (2&#160;&#215;&#160;2) tunnel structure, which improves the structural stability of MnO2, facilitates the proton diffusion and Zn2+ adsorption on the MnO2 surface upon battery cycling. It is further revealed that for the MnO2 cathode, the charge storage reaction proceeds mainly by proton intercalation with the formation of &#945;&#8208;HyCoxMnO2, and that the anode design (with or without Zn metal) affects the surface adsorption of by&#8208;product Zn4SO4(OH)6&#183;nH2O on MnO2 surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of rechargeable Zn batteries and also sheds light on efficient electrode modifications toward performance enhancement.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal phosphide nanoparticles are prepared under mild conditions following a synthetic approach involving the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds in the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force for the reaction. The simplicity and versatility of this approach is demonstrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles (NPs), and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct.

&lt;p&gt;Metal phosphide nanoparticles are prepared under mild conditions following a synthetic approach involving the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds in the by-product SiClMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a driving force for the reaction. The simplicity and versatility of this approach is demonstrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles (NPs), and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M-Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide NPs using [RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35 &#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy (EM), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and Co&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; NPs can also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Solution&#8208;Processed Single Component Organic Photodetectors Achieved by Strong Quenching of Intermolecular Emissive State and High Quadrupole Moment in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.








Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;&#8208;cyanogroup&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8722;4&#8208;acyl acrylate and PbI2 during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).








Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. This article presents the development of an in situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature&#8208;controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm s&#8722;1) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared with 152&#160;nm s&#8722;1 and 37&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor of 82.78%. The bare device without any protection maintains 89% of its initial efficiency after 6600&#160;h of aging in ambient environment. This work implies that the in situ observation using fluorescence microscopy is a critical for understanding of crystallization kinetics in film devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l&#8208;CMSNs) performs better in the sequential oral absorption processes than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (Dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts via multiple chiral recognition mechanisms, and ultimately undertaking the responsibility of efficient oral drug delivery. These findings validate the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d&#8208;CMSNs) are fabricated via a one&#8208;pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l&#8208;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal approach is adopted to fabricate a new layered and strained Mn0.98Ir0.02O2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (sl&#8208;Mn0.98Ir0.02O2) with optimized electronic structure induced by Ir incorporation. The obtained strained nanosheets have only trace amount of Ir loading and exhibit the highest iridium mass activity (5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV).








Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation is developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#9472;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Conversion of Photodetector and Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on a Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN device is fabricated. According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow-release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM-mediated solution growth of crystalline Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.

         <title>Chiral Iron Oxide Supraparticles Enable Enantiomer&#8208;Dependent Tumor&#8208;Targeted Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated. The in vivo MRI results show D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs to enhance targeted enrichment in tumor tissue.








Abstract
The chemical, physical and biological effects of chiral nanomaterials have inspired general interest and demonstrated important advantages in fundamental science. Here, chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated, and these SPs act as high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated chiral Fe3O4 SPs have a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results show that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhances targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma and brain glioma tumors. Notably, it is found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs have 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncover that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

         <title>Isomerized Green Solid Additive Engineering for Thermally Stable and Eco&#8208;Friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 19% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Bendable Silicene Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 2D silicene into bendable membranes allows investigating its optothermal and piezoresistive properties when external strain is applied on a micro and macroscale, thus representing an advance toward a new generation of flexible and fully silicon&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co&#8208;integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large&#8208;scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain&#8208;responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature&#8208;dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device&#8208;ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon&#8208;compatible technology framework.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel electrolyte is adopted to bond interface water molecules to suppress water activity and alleviate water&#8208;induced side&#160;reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Due to the interface water bonding effect, symmetric Zn cells assemble with the BC hydrogel electrolyte cycle stably and deliver a high utilization rate (&gt;85%) of Zn anode under harsh test conditions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, this work shows that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembles with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and shows a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy Through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovaccine comprising cancer cell membrane, monophosphoryl lipid A, and anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (named CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28) activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells by interacting with both dendritic cells (DCs) and na&#239;ve T cells. CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 exhibits higher efficacy in tumor&#8208;specific T cell activation and tumor inhibition than nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or na&#239;ve T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28).








Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine is developed that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both the presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals. Intense multi&#8208;color circular polarized luminescence and circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are achieved, with high dissymmetry factors (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 and &#8722;1.57, respectively. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is further realized based on multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of N*&#8208;LCs.








Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored.

&lt;p&gt;A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*-LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*-LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*-LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, mainly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*-LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N-LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*-LCs effectively amplify the CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, the selective reflection band of N*-LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with a dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) up to &#8722;1.87 is realized at 9&#160;wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of the selective reflection mechanism, multi-color CPL-active N*-LCs with high &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>3D Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 3D printed elastomer parts are prepared by using a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization system from high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin. After thermal treatment, the cross&#8208;linking polymerization of the chain extender and the unblocked isocyanate functional group effectively increases the molecular weight of the elastomer rendering a high mechanical performance (&#8776;a strain of 1600% and a stress of &#8776;26&#160;MPa).








Abstract
Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leveling agent of 4,6&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptopyrimidine (DMP) typically used in the copper electroplating industry is selected as a non&#8208;expendable electrolyte additive for Li metal anodes. The DMP leveler successfully adjusts the solvation structure due to strong coordination ability and absorbs on Li metal forming a functional molecular layer. Consequently, the Li deposition is flat, dendrite&#8208;free, and less by&#8208;products from interfacial side reactions.








Abstract
Li metal anodes are extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, is selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries are systematically investigated and they show stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent shows that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal can suppress side reactions and modify the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler does not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Structure Simulation of Methylthiolated Peri&#8208;Condensed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Identifying Promising Molecular Semiconductors: Discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene Showing Ultrahigh Mobility</title>

         <dc:description>
Material chemists pursue a way to identify ideal compounds to synthesize without wasting time on synthetic trials. A computational simulation method for crystal structures that identifies a promising molecular semiconductor, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene, among methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. Through experiments, its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors are confirmed to exhibit ultrahigh mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier&#8208;transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford&#160;high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility is not realized in other methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials. To realize this, a new computational approach is developed to simulate crystal structures of all methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, which is then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) is expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. Thus, MT&#8208;peropyrene is chosen as the synthetic target, and a new peropyrene synthesis method is developed. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors show mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity and Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop CuS Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption.

Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF.

Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF.

&lt;p&gt;The ultrasonic induced-cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Mixed&#8208;Cation Surface Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation system (CE) to synergically passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S&#8208;Q limit, and superior flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4&#8208;trifluoro phenethylammonium (CF3&#8208;PEA+, denoted as CA+) and ethylenediammonium (EDA2+, denoted as EA2+) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non&#8208;radiative recombination rate, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60&#160;&#176;C for 500&#160;h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators is a promising strategy to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs and corresponding POTSCs.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

&lt;/i&gt;/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high-capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte-related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub-nano scale interfused SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering In Situ Catalytic Cleaning Membrane Via Prebiotic&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Mineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy is developed for aqueous dip&#8208;coating of catalytic nanomaterials onto the hydrophobic polymeric membrane at room temperature. The biomimetic mineralized superhydrophilic membrane enables the operando flux recovery beyond 99.8% and a ninefold higher flux recovery compared to the control one, attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. The mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which is attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves the way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
OPEN can effectively target IBD lesions and slowly release PFT&#945;. OPEN specifically targets p53 signaling, inhibits excessive apoptosis of IECs in IBD lesions, and plays a role in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier repair, anti&#8208;inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiome, while having good biocompatibility.








The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles
In article number 2306621, Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner, and co&#8208;workers report the preparation of metal phosphide nanoparticles through the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. In the reaction, the release of the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force. The exploitation of the strength of the Si&#8211;Cl bond as compared to many metal&#8211;Cl bonds is expected to provide easy access to a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles.

Mineralization Strategies
In article number 2306626, Xiaobin Yang, Seth B. Darling, Lu Shao, and co&#8208;workers report an aminomalononitrile/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy, inspired by prebiotic chemistry, for engineering a superhydrophilic coating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with robust catalytic cleaning ability. The entire fabrication of these coatings is performed in an aqueous buffer system and at ambient conditions. The biomimetic mineralized membranes exhibit substantially improved recovery after exposure to a fouling environment.

Darling, Lu Shao, and co-workers report an aminomalononitrile/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated mineralization strategy, inspired by prebiotic chemistry, for engineering a superhydrophilic coating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with robust catalytic cleaning ability. The entire fabrication of these coatings is performed in an aqueous buffer system and at ambient conditions. The biomimetic mineralized membranes exhibit substantially improved recovery after exposure to a fouling environment.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Discharge Products in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is limited by the difficulty of discharge product (DP) decomposition because of their thermodynamical stability. This review revisits the impacts of discharge products on L&#8211;CO2 batteries, assesses advanced techniques for mechanism investigation of DP formation and decomposition, and reviews the main control methods for DP management to boost the Li&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries are promising devices for CO2 recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li2CO3) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progress has been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is reported for the first time. Fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs are appraised; impacts on battery performance including overpotential, capacity, and stability are demonstrated; and the necessity of discharge product management is highlighted. Practical in situ/operando technologies are assessed to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and promote practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely applied in optoelectronics and material sciences. In the past decade, molecular electrochemistry has emerged as a novel and robust tool for PAHs synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive survey on electrochemical assembly of PAHs largely by the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded&#8208;growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.








Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. The advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large&#8208;scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based and noble metal&#8208;free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, views are offered on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8211;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardized stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and beyond.

         <title>Bioadhesives with Antimicrobial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research on bioadhesives is gaining new heights with the incorporation of innovative antimicrobial activity mechanisms. Strategies to achieve antimicrobial activity without compromise from biocompatibility, adhesion and cohesion are being devised. Unique approaches in the application of these bioadhesives and methods to reveal their elusive properties are diversifying. Bioadhesives are coming one step closer to replace many traditional surgical devices in the clinic.








Abstract
Bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties enable easier and safer treatment of wounds as compared to the traditional methods such as suturing and stapling. Composed of natural or synthetic polymers, these bioadhesives seal wounds and facilitate healing while preventing infections through the activity of locally released antimicrobial drugs, nanocomponents, or inherently antimicrobial polers. Although many different materials and strategies are employed to develop antimicrobial bioadhesives, the design of these biomaterials necessitates a prudent approach as achieving all the required properties including optimal adhesive and cohesive properties, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity can be challenging. Designing antimicrobial bioadhesives with tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties will shed light on the path for future advancement of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In this review, the requirements and commonly used strategies for developing bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties are discussed. In particular, different methods for their synthesis and their experimental and clinical applications on a variety of organs are reviewed. Advances in the design of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties will pave the way for a better management of wounds to increase positive clinical outcomes.

         <title>Soft Functionally Gradient Materials and Structures &#8211; Natural and Manmade: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft functionally gradient materials (FGM) having gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions are ideally suitable to manage interfacial stresses in dissimilar materials used in many emerging technologies for human interaction, such as soft robotics. The critical challenges in material, design, and fabrication methods are discussed in the context of the remarkable examples of natural FGMs.








Abstract
Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) are used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there is increasing interest in polymer&#8208;based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy, and adapt to changing environments. Here, the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts are discussed using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, the challenges and potential pathways are highlighted to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties toward functional FGMs.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive materials are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8211;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution, and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photomodulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials are aimed to be systematically summarized and discussed. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution, and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8211;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been of considerable interest for energy harvesting, due to their high gravimetric surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. In this review, the working principles, applications, and challenges of CNT&#8208;based nanogenerators based on electrochemical, hydroelectric, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects are introduced.








Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. Here, various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

&lt;p&gt;There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy-harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self-powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years.
