         <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)/perovskite Heterointerface by Spinodal Decomposition Enabling Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)/perovskite (P3HT/PVK) heterointerface is created by using a novel strategy of spinodal decomposition, which effectively alleviates both energy and carrier losses in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This innovative approach achieves a remarkable 24.53% power conversion efficiency for PSCs.








Abstract
The best research&#8208;cell efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is comparable with that of mature silicon solar cells (SSCs); However, the industrial development of PSCs lags far behind SSCs. PSC is a multiphase and multicomponent system, whose consequent interfacial energy loss and carrier loss seriously affect the performance and stability of devices. Here, by using spinodal decomposition, a spontaneous solid phase segregation process, in situ introduces a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)/perovskite (P3HT/PVK) heterointerface with interpenetrating structure in PSCs. The P3HT/PVK heterointerface tunes the energy alignment, thereby reducing the energy loss at the interface; The P3HT/PVK interpenetrating structure bridges a transport channel, thus decreasing the carrier loss at the interface. The simultaneous mitigation of energy and carrier losses by P3HT/PVK heterointerface enables n&#8208;i&#8208;p geometry device a power conversion efficiency of 24.53% (certified 23.94%) and excellent stability. These findings demonstrate an ingenious strategy to optimize the performance of PSCs by heterointerface via Spinodal decomposition.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Trimetallic Nanozyme for Sustainable Cascaded Catalytic Therapy via Tumor Microenvironment Remodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and facile method to synthesize acidity&#8208;responsive trimetallic nanozyme (AMCc) under the combined action of tannic acid and ascorbic acid is attempted first. The unprecedented nanozyme AMCc with excellent peroxidase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, and glucose oxidase&#8208;like activity can be used for glutathione depletion and substrates self&#8208;supply and achieve self&#8208;replenishing and self&#8208;reinforcing cascaded catalytic starvation/photothermal&#8208;enhanced chemodynamic synergistic therapy via tumor microenvironment remodulation.








Abstract
Tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed cancer therapy shows great potential due to its specificity and efficiency. However, breaking the self&#8208;adaption of tumors and improving the sustainable remodeling TME ability remains a major challenge for developing novel nanozymes. Here, a rapid method is developed first to synthesize unprecedented trimetalic nanozyme (AuMnCu, AMC) with a targeting peptide (AMCc), which exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, and glucose oxidase&#8208;like activities. The released Cu and Mn ions in TME consume endogenous H2O2 and produce O2, while the&#160;AMCccatalyzes glucose oxidation reaction to generate H2O2 and gluconic acid, which achieves the starvation therapy by depleting the energy and enhances the chemodynamic therapy effect by lowering the pH of the TME and producing extra H2O2. Meanwhile, the reactive oxygen species damage is amplified, as AMCc can constantly oxidize intracellular reductive glutathione through the cyclic valence alternation of Cu and Mn ions, and the generated Cu+ elevate the production of &#183;OH from H2O2. Further studies depict that the well&#8208;designed AMCc exhibits the excellent photothermal performance and achieves TME&#8208;responsive sustainable starvation/photothermal&#8208;enhanced chemodynamic synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Overall, a promising approach is demonstrated here to design &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme for theranostics by remodeling the TME.

         <title>Trace Water in Lead Iodide Affecting Perovskite Crystal Nucleation Limits the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material purity impacts optoelectronic properties; trace water in chemicals affects perovskite formation, influencing performance. This study unveils the significance of water content in PbI2, affecting crystallization and texture and ultimately decreasing hole mobility. Imbalanced hole&#8211;electron mobility limits device performance. Certified PCEs of 24.3% and 22.9% for small and larger aperture solar cells are achieved by fine&#8208;controlling water content in PbI2.








Abstract
The experimental replicability of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is a persistent challenge faced by laboratories worldwide. Although trace impurities in raw materials can impact the experimental reproducibility of high&#8208;performance PSCs, the in situ study of how trace impurities affect perovskite film growth is never investigated. Here, light is shed on the impact of inevitable water contamination in lead iodide (PbI2) on the replicability of device performance, mainly depending on the synthesis methods of PbI2. Through synchrotron&#8208;based structure characterization, it is uncovered that even slight additions of water to PbI2 accelerate the crystallization process in the perovskite layer during annealing. However, this accelerated crystallization also results in an imbalance of charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, leading to a degradation in device performance and reduced longevity of the solar cells. It is also found that anhydrous PbI2 promotes a homogenous nucleation process and improves perovskite film growth. Finally, the PSCs achieve a remarkable certified power conversion efficiency of 24.3%. This breakthrough demonstrates the significance of understanding and precisely managing the water content in PbI2 to ensure the experimental replicability of high&#8208;efficiency PSCs.

         <title>Multilevel Gradient&#8208;Ordered Silicon Anode with Unprecedented Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon generally exhibits inactive practical sodium storage. This study revives and maximizes the sodium storage activity of pure silicon by atomic ordered structural regulation and provides novel insights into the sodium storage mechanism. Furthermore, the design strategy demonstrates universality in other inert and low&#8208;capacity anode. The multilevel gradient&#8208;ordered silicon shows unprecedented performance and navigates new strategy for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
While cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity &lt;40 mAh g&#8722;1). To address this issue, herein an atomic&#8208;order structural&#8208;design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient&#8208;ordered silicon (MGO&#8208;Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ&#8208;formed short&#8208;range&#8208;, medium&#8208;range&#8208;, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures construct a stable MGO&#8208;Si, which contributes to favorable Na&#8211;Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO&#8208;Si involves an adsorption&#8211;intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient&#8208;ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g&#8722;1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low&#8208;capacity materials (micro&#8208;Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5&#8211;6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better&#8208;performing battery designs.

         <title>A Nanozyme&#8208;Based Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neural electrodes are indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders. However, their detection sensitivity and biocompatibility remain unsolved challenges. Here, nanozyme electrodes that can simultaneously overcome the limitations associated with recording sensitivity, long&#8208;term acquisition stability, and peripheral nerve tissue necrosis through interfacial quantum transport and inhibition of neuroinflammation are developed, which are promising for brain science and engineering.








Abstract
Implanted neural electrodes have been widely used to treat brain diseases that require high sensitivity and biocompatibility at the tissue&#8211;electrode interface. However, currently used clinical electrodes cannot meet both these requirements simultaneously, which hinders the effective recording of electronic signals. Herein, nanozyme&#8208;based neural electrodes incorporating bioinspired atomically precise clusters are developed as a general strategy with a heterogeneous design for multiscale and ultrasensitive neural recording via quantum transport and biocatalytic processes. Owing to the dual high&#8208;speed electronic and ionic currents at the electrode&#8211;tissue interface, the impedance of nanozyme electrodes is 26 times lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes, and the acquisition sensitivity for the local field potential is &#8776;10 times higher than that of clinical PtIr electrodes, enabling a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of up to 14.7&#160;dB for single&#8208;neuron recordings in rats. The electrodes provide more than 100&#8208;fold higher antioxidant and multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities, which effectively decrease 67% of the neuronal injury area by inhibiting glial proliferation and allowing sensitive and stable neural recording. Moreover, nanozyme electrodes can considerably improve the SNR of seizures in acute epileptic rats and are expected to achieve precise localization of seizure foci in clinical settings.

         <title>Maximizing Triboelectric Nanogenerators by Physics&#8208;Informed AI Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs. This paper provides insights into the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators and presents physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design strategies to tackle these challenges. The potential of physics&#8208;informed inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators to intelligent systems is discussed.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought&#8208;after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real&#8208;life applications. Artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance&#8208;oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics&#8208;informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four&#8208;mode analytical models by physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real&#8208;life applications is discussed.

         <title>Distinguishing Molecular Mechanical Action from Photothermal and Photodynamic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors are small molecule actuators that can permeabilize lipid bilayers, kill cancer cells and microorganisms, and control cell signaling. Here, a roadmap is provided detailing how to distinguish the photomechanical action characteristic to these motors from photothermal and photodynamic effects. It is hoped that this framework leads to a robust criterion for the isolation of the effects of molecular motion as the community seeks to use molecular motors for new and distinctive applications.








Abstract
Molecular motors (MM) are molecular machines, or nanomachines, that rotate unidirectionally upon photostimulation and perform mechanical work on their environment. In the last several years, it has been shown that the photomechanical action of MM can be used to permeabilize lipid bilayers, thereby killing cancer cells and pathogenic microorganisms and controlling cell signaling. The work contributes to a growing acknowledgement that the molecular actuation characteristic of these systems is useful for various applications in biology. However, the mechanical effects of molecular motion on biological materials are difficult to disentangle from photodynamic and photothermal action, which are also present when a light&#8208;absorbing fluorophore is irradiated with light. Here, an overview of the key methods used by various research groups to distinguish the effects of photomechanical, photodynamic, and photothermal action is provided. It is anticipated that this discussion will be helpful to the community seeking to use MM to develop new and distinctive medical technologies that result from mechanical disruption of biological materials.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited&#8208;State in Fe&#8211;Gallate Complex Improves Iron Cycle and Enables Sustainable Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of a long&#8208;lived ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state and single electron transfer promotes the Fe cycle in the Fenton&#8208;like process and achieves efficient and sustainable Fenton chemistry. The system achieves comprehensive improvements in reaction kinetics, catalyst&#8208;specific activity, &#8226;OH productivity, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Fenton reactions are inefficient because the Fe(II) catalyst cannot be recycled in time due to the lack of a rapid electron transport pathway. This results in huge H2O2 wastage in industrial applications. Here, it is shown that a sustainable heterogeneous Fenton system is attainable by enhancing the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) excited&#8208;state lifetime in Fe&#8211;gallate complex. By engineering oxygen defects in the complex, the lifetime is improved from 10&#8211;90 ps. The lengthened lifetime ensures sufficient concentrations of excited&#8208;states for an efficient Fe cycle, realizing previously unattainable H2O2 activation kinetics and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) productivity. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show the cyclic reaction mechanism involves in situ Fe(II) regeneration and synchronous supply of oxygen atoms from water to recover dissociated Fe&#9472;O bonds. Trace amounts of this catalyst effectively destroy two drug&#8208;resistant bacteria even after eight reaction cycles. This work reveals the link among LMCT excited&#8208;state lifetime, Fe cycle, and catalytic activity and stability, with implications for de novo design of efficient and sustainable Fenton&#8208;like processes.

         <title>Magnetic Particle Imaging: From Tracer Design to Biomedical Applications in Vasculature Abnormality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticle imaging is an emerging method based on tracking the distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (&#8220;tracers&#8221;) in vivo, where the imaging sensitivity, spatial resolution, and applications largely depend on the properties of the tracers. This article describes the imaging principles and features of MPI, the advancement in tracer structural design and synthesis, and the latest biomedical applications of MPI particularly&#160;in studying&#160;vasculature abnormality.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging non&#8208;invasive tomographic technique based on the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to oscillating drive fields at the center of a static magnetic gradient. In contrast to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is driven by uniform magnetic fields and projects the anatomic information of the subjects, MPI directly tracks and quantifies MNPs in vivo without background signals. Moreover, it does not require radioactive tracers and has no limitations on imaging depth. This article first introduces the basic principles of MPI and important features of MNPs for imaging sensitivity, spatial resolution, and targeted biodistribution. The latest research aiming to optimize the performance of&#160;MPI tracers is reviewed based on their material composition, physical properties, and surface modifications. While the unique advantages of MPI have led to a series of promising biomedical applications, recent development of MPI in investigating&#160;vascular abnormalities in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, and cancer are also discussed. Finally, recent progress and challenges in the clinical translation of MPI are discussed to provide possible directions for future research and development.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article critically summarizes the recent literature on 3D printable materials and structures with self&#8208;healing characteristics, emphasizing the intimate relationship between chemical and physical properties and printability, toward the design and fabrication of advanced components. Moreover, it highlights actual applications, envisaging future directions of investigation.








Abstract
This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. The review will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

         <title>Anchoring &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Dual&#8208;Active Centers on Carbon Nanotubes for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This study demonstrates the first case of applying hexaazanonaphthalene (HATNH)&#8208;based 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;HATNH) integrated with carbon nanotubes via an in situ polymerization strategy to achieve stable long cycle stability and excellent rate performance with conjugated HATNH and unsaturated [CuO4] units as multiple redox active sites.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are gradually gaining attention owing to their natural abundance, excellent security, and high energy density. However, developing excellent organic cathode materials for PIBs to overcome the poor cycling stability and slow kinetics caused by the large radii of K+ ions is challenging. This study demonstrates for the first time the application of a hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with dual&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;HATNH) and integrates Cu&#8208;HATNH with carbon nanotubes (Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT) as the cathode material for PIBs. Owing to this systematic module integration and more exposed active sites with high utilization, Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT exhibits a high initial capacity (317.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 96.8% at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2200 cycles), and outstanding rate capacity (147.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The reaction mechanism and performance are determined by combining experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations. This contribution provides new opportunities for designing high&#8208;performance 2D c&#8208;MOF cathodes with multiple active sites for PIBs.

         <title>Communicating Supraparticles to Enable Perceptual, Information&#8208;Providing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e., (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized information providing additives, is presented. Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli&#8208;recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is obtained on demand.








Abstract
Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials. Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of considering materials as passive objects and turning them into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. This matter is capable of communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand. Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter by integrating customizable (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized communicating supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli&#8208;susceptible. Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli&#8208;recorder features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof, in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.

         <title>Bendable Silicene Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 2D silicene into bendable membranes allows investigating its optothermal and piezoresistive properties when external strain is applied on a micro and macroscale, thus representing an advance toward a new generation of flexible and fully silicon&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co&#8208;integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large&#8208;scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain&#8208;responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature&#8208;dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device&#8208;ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon&#8208;compatible technology framework.

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy Through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovaccine comprising cancer cell membrane, monophosphoryl lipid A, and anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (named CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28) activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells by interacting with both dendritic cells (DCs) and na&#239;ve T cells. CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 exhibits higher efficacy in tumor&#8208;specific T cell activation and tumor inhibition than nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or na&#239;ve T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28).








Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine is developed that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both the presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>Efficient Surfactant&#8208;Mediated Photovoltaic Manipulation of fL&#8208;Scale Aqueous Microdroplets for Diverse Optofluidic Applications on LiNbO3 Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is reported. The merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets and the microdroplet&#8208;assisted coupling of focused laser beams are demonstrated. Moreover, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved by leveraging the selective permeability of droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets.








Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation is proposed, where the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8211;oil and oil&#8211;Lithium niobate&#160;interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#181;W&#8208;level laser in oil media. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position is realized and the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings are demonstrated. To demonstrate its potential in photonic Micro&#8208;Electro&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;System assemblies, the end coupling of a focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface is demonstrated. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode characteristics.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors report a facile and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of pyrochlore iron (III) hydroxy fluoride (Pyr&#8208;IHF), enabling to produce Pyr&#8208;IHF at a low cost. Pyr&#8208;IHF&#8208;containing cathodes show superior capacity retention of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities, and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high costs of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8211;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of the Gelated Tumor Interstitium around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;Targeting for Precise and Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma protein&#8208;like nanomedicine p(EK&#8208;co&#8208;C&#8208;SPA&#8208;ss&#8208;Dox) is developed to enable the integration of all&#8208;barrier&#8208;penetration with active targeting in a single nanodelivery system. Moreover, it is revealed both mechanisms: liquification of surrounding gelated water molecules by zwitterionic p(EK) shell to overcome diffusion barrier in polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor&#160;interstitium, and pH&#8208;triggered targeting to GD2&#8208;overexpressed solid tumor by a negative&#8208;biased zwitterionic shell of nanomedicine.








Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine is developed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to five times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over ten times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil by more than three times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <title>Flexible Optoelectronic Multimodal Proximity/Pressure/Temperature Sensors with Low Signal Interference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensors are proposed by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous structure. Self&#8208;decoupled sensing of proximity/pressure/temperature is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics. Negligible signal interference opens up promising paths for multimodal tactile sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity, and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithms hinder the actual applications. Here, this work reports a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibits a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7% &#176;C&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among colloidal quantum wells, self&#8208;assembled of the layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95% is successfully realized. Incorporation of the novel hole transfer layer PF8Cz effectively suppresses electron leakage, which leads to the high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.9%.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, is limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) are demonstrated. Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37% is successfully spin&#8208;coated. The devices exhibit a remarkable peak EQE of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55&#160;754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15&#160;000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. The work is expected to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Structure Simulation of Methylthiolated Peri&#8208;Condensed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Identifying Promising Molecular Semiconductors: Discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene Showing Ultrahigh Mobility</title>

Material chemists pursue a way to identify ideal compounds to synthesize without wasting time on synthetic trials. A computational simulation method for crystal structures that identifies a promising molecular semiconductor, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene, among methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. Through experiments, its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors are confirmed to exhibit ultrahigh mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier&#8208;transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford&#160;high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility is not realized in other methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials. To realize this, a new computational approach is developed to simulate crystal structures of all methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, which is then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) is expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. Thus, MT&#8208;peropyrene is chosen as the synthetic target, and a new peropyrene synthesis method is developed. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors show mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

         <title>Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Mixed&#8208;Cation Surface Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation system (CE) to synergically passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S&#8208;Q limit, and superior flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4&#8208;trifluoro phenethylammonium (CF3&#8208;PEA+, denoted as CA+) and ethylenediammonium (EDA2+, denoted as EA2+) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non&#8208;radiative recombination rate, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60&#160;&#176;C for 500&#160;h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators is a promising strategy to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs and corresponding POTSCs.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate&#8208;based multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and micro&#8208;texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Adsorption and Proton Chemistry of Ultra&#8208;Stabilized Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Manganese Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural stability strategy is proposed to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 in Zn&#8208;based aqueous devices and provide atomic insights. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism of proton chemistry and Zn ion surface adsorption in CoxMnO2 is revealed. Moreover, the mechanism of the influence of the anode selection on the surface adsorption process is studied.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zinc (Zn) batteries incorporating MnO2 cathodes possess favorable sustainability properties and are being considered for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, unstable electrode structures and unclear charge storage mechanisms limit their development. Here, advanced transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculations are utilized to study the working mechanisms of a Zn/MnO2 battery with a Co2+&#8208;stabilized, tunnel&#8208;structured &#945;&#8208;MnO2 cathode (CoxMnO2). It is shown that Co2+ can be pre&#8208;intercalated into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 and occupy the (2&#160;&#215;&#160;2) tunnel structure, which improves the structural stability of MnO2, facilitates the proton diffusion and Zn2+ adsorption on the MnO2 surface upon battery cycling. It is further revealed that for the MnO2 cathode, the charge storage reaction proceeds mainly by proton intercalation with the formation of &#945;&#8208;HyCoxMnO2, and that the anode design (with or without Zn metal) affects the surface adsorption of by&#8208;product Zn4SO4(OH)6&#183;nH2O on MnO2 surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of rechargeable Zn batteries and also sheds light on efficient electrode modifications toward performance enhancement.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal phosphide nanoparticles are prepared under mild conditions following a synthetic approach involving the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds in the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force for the reaction. The simplicity and versatility of this approach is demonstrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles (NPs), and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M&#8208;Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide NPs using [RuCl2(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35 &#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru50P50 composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo50P50 and Co50P50 NPs can also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Engineering In Situ Catalytic Cleaning Membrane Via Prebiotic&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Mineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy is developed for aqueous dip&#8208;coating of catalytic nanomaterials onto the hydrophobic polymeric membrane at room temperature. The biomimetic mineralized superhydrophilic membrane enables the operando flux recovery beyond 99.8% and a ninefold higher flux recovery compared to the control one, attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. The mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which is attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves the way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

         <title>The State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Solution&#8208;Processed Single Component Organic Photodetectors Achieved by Strong Quenching of Intermolecular Emissive State and High Quadrupole Moment in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.








Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>

A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Understanding Microstructural Development of Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>

The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;&#8208;cyanogroup&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8722;4&#8208;acyl acrylate and PbI2 during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).








Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. This article presents the development of an in situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature&#8208;controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm s&#8722;1) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared with 152&#160;nm s&#8722;1 and 37&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor of 82.78%. The bare device without any protection maintains 89% of its initial efficiency after 6600&#160;h of aging in ambient environment. This work implies that the in situ observation using fluorescence microscopy is a critical for understanding of crystallization kinetics in film devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l&#8208;CMSNs) performs better in the sequential oral absorption processes than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (Dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts via multiple chiral recognition mechanisms, and ultimately undertaking the responsibility of efficient oral drug delivery. These findings validate the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.








Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d&#8208;CMSNs) are fabricated via a one&#8208;pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l&#8208;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal approach is adopted to fabricate a new layered and strained Mn0.98Ir0.02O2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (sl&#8208;Mn0.98Ir0.02O2) with optimized electronic structure induced by Ir incorporation. The obtained strained nanosheets have only trace amount of Ir loading and exhibit the highest iridium mass activity (5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV).








Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation is developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#9472;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Conversion of Photodetector and Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on a Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN device is fabricated. According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics, Li anode corrosion, etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer, and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth, and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1244&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery toward realistic applications.

         <title>Chiral Iron Oxide Supraparticles Enable Enantiomer&#8208;Dependent Tumor&#8208;Targeted Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated. The in vivo MRI results show D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs to enhance targeted enrichment in tumor tissue.








Abstract
The chemical, physical and biological effects of chiral nanomaterials have inspired general interest and demonstrated important advantages in fundamental science. Here, chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated, and these SPs act as high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated chiral Fe3O4 SPs have a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results show that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhances targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma and brain glioma tumors. Notably, it is found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs have 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncover that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
OPEN can effectively target IBD lesions and slowly release PFT&#945;. OPEN specifically targets p53 signaling, inhibits excessive apoptosis of IECs in IBD lesions, and plays a role in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier repair, anti&#8208;inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiome, while having good biocompatibility.








The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel electrolyte is adopted to bond interface water molecules to suppress water activity and alleviate water&#8208;induced side&#160;reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Due to the interface water bonding effect, symmetric Zn cells assemble with the BC hydrogel electrolyte cycle stably and deliver a high utilization rate (&gt;85%) of Zn anode under harsh test conditions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, this work shows that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembles with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and shows a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals. Intense multi&#8208;color circular polarized luminescence and circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are achieved, with high dissymmetry factors (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 and &#8722;1.57, respectively. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is further realized based on multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of N*&#8208;LCs.








Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, mainly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify the CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, the selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 is realized at 9&#160;wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of the selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with glum up to &#8722;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated by exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring of CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>3D Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 3D printed elastomer parts are prepared by using a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization system from high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin. After thermal treatment, the cross&#8208;linking polymerization of the chain extender and the unblocked isocyanate functional group effectively increases the molecular weight of the elastomer rendering a high mechanical performance (&#8776;a strain of 1600% and a stress of &#8776;26&#160;MPa).








Abstract
Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leveling agent of 4,6&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptopyrimidine (DMP) typically used in the copper electroplating industry is selected as a non&#8208;expendable electrolyte additive for Li metal anodes. The DMP leveler successfully adjusts the solvation structure due to strong coordination ability and absorbs on Li metal forming a functional molecular layer. Consequently, the Li deposition is flat, dendrite&#8208;free, and less by&#8208;products from interfacial side reactions.








Abstract
Li metal anodes are extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, is selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries are systematically investigated and they show stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent shows that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal can suppress side reactions and modify the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler does not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity and Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop CuS Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

&lt;p&gt;A wet-adaptive electronic skin (WADE-skin) is developed, which consists of a next-to-skin wet-adhesive fibrous layer, a next-to-air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE-skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human-machine interactions.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles
In article number 2306621, Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner, and co&#8208;workers report the preparation of metal phosphide nanoparticles through the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. In the reaction, the release of the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force. The exploitation of the strength of the Si&#8211;Cl bond as compared to many metal&#8211;Cl bonds is expected to provide easy access to a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles.

Mineralization Strategies
In article number 2306626, Xiaobin Yang, Seth B. Darling, Lu Shao, and co&#8208;workers report an aminomalononitrile/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy, inspired by prebiotic chemistry, for engineering a superhydrophilic coating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with robust catalytic cleaning ability. The entire fabrication of these coatings is performed in an aqueous buffer system and at ambient conditions. The biomimetic mineralized membranes exhibit substantially improved recovery after exposure to a fouling environment.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large&#8208;scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based and noble metal&#8208;free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, views are offered on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8211;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardized stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and beyond.

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely applied in optoelectronics and material sciences. In the past decade, molecular electrochemistry has emerged as a novel and robust tool for PAHs synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive survey on electrochemical assembly of PAHs largely by the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro-oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioadhesives with Antimicrobial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research on bioadhesives is gaining new heights with the incorporation of innovative antimicrobial activity mechanisms. Strategies to achieve antimicrobial activity without compromise from biocompatibility, adhesion and cohesion are being devised. Unique approaches in the application of these bioadhesives and methods to reveal their elusive properties are diversifying. Bioadhesives are coming one step closer to replace many traditional surgical devices in the clinic.








Abstract
Bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties enable easier and safer treatment of wounds as compared to the traditional methods such as suturing and stapling. Composed of natural or synthetic polymers, these bioadhesives seal wounds and facilitate healing while preventing infections through the activity of locally released antimicrobial drugs, nanocomponents, or inherently antimicrobial polers. Although many different materials and strategies are employed to develop antimicrobial bioadhesives, the design of these biomaterials necessitates a prudent approach as achieving all the required properties including optimal adhesive and cohesive properties, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity can be challenging. Designing antimicrobial bioadhesives with tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties will shed light on the path for future advancement of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In this review, the requirements and commonly used strategies for developing bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties are discussed. In particular, different methods for their synthesis and their experimental and clinical applications on a variety of organs are reviewed. Advances in the design of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties will pave the way for a better management of wounds to increase positive clinical outcomes.

         <title>Soft Functionally Gradient Materials and Structures &#8211; Natural and Manmade: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft functionally gradient materials (FGM) having gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions are ideally suitable to manage interfacial stresses in dissimilar materials used in many emerging technologies for human interaction, such as soft robotics. The critical challenges in material, design, and fabrication methods are discussed in the context of the remarkable examples of natural FGMs.








Abstract
Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) are used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there is increasing interest in polymer&#8208;based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy, and adapt to changing environments. Here, the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts are discussed using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, the challenges and potential pathways are highlighted to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties toward functional FGMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been of considerable interest for energy harvesting, due to their high gravimetric surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. In this review, the working principles, applications, and challenges of CNT&#8208;based nanogenerators based on electrochemical, hydroelectric, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects are introduced.








Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. Here, various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded&#8208;growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.








Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. The advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Discharge Products in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is limited by the difficulty of discharge product (DP) decomposition because of their thermodynamical stability. This review revisits the impacts of discharge products on L&#8211;CO2 batteries, assesses advanced techniques for mechanism investigation of DP formation and decomposition, and reviews the main control methods for DP management to boost the Li&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries are promising devices for CO2 recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li2CO3) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progress has been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is reported for the first time. Fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs are appraised; impacts on battery performance including overpotential, capacity, and stability are demonstrated; and the necessity of discharge product management is highlighted. Practical in situ/operando technologies are assessed to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and promote practical applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable lithium-carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are promising devices for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progress has been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is reported for the first time. Fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs are appraised; impacts on battery performance including overpotential, capacity, and stability are demonstrated; and the necessity of discharge product management is highlighted. Practical in situ/operando technologies are assessed to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and promote practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive materials are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8211;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution, and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photomodulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials are aimed to be systematically summarized and discussed. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution, and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8211;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.

         <title>A Generic Strategy to Stabilize Wide Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, we investigate the root cause of halide segregation, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to electrical potential differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide at proper temperature, we can effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, we achieve a notable improvement of approximately 100&#160;mV in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8208;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate an efficiency of 26.1% in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Specific Propyne Trapping Sites Within A Robust Mof for Efficient Propyne/Propadiene Separation with Record Propadiene Productivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Separating propyne/propadiene to produce pure propadiene is extremely challenging in industry due to their similar properties. Herein, we reported a novel ZrF62&#8722; anion pillared cage&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (termed as CuZrF6&#8208;TPA) for highly efficient propyne/propadiene separation. It exhibits high propyne capacity (177.4/188.6 cm3/cm3 at 0.5/1.0 bar and 298 K), benchmark separation selectivity (6.0) and remarkable separation potential (5.7 mol/L) simultaneously. Record propadiene productivity (ca. 4.7 mol/L) was achieved through a single adsorption process in breakthrough experiments with excellent recycle stability even under humid conditions. Based on the structure of propyne&#8208;loaded single crystals, two binding sites were identified, including a major propyne trapping site at the windows and a minor binding site located in the large cages. Modelling studies further confirmed that the contracted cage windows surrounded with rotating Lewis basic F atoms and aromatic rings are the optimal bonding sites to capture propyne with multiple hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

         <title>A Conformable Organic Electronic Device for Monitoring Epithelial Integrity at The Air Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air liquid interfaced (ALI) epithelial barriers are essential for homeostatic functions such as nutrient transport and immunological protection. Dysfunction of such barriers are implicated in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and, as such, sensors capable of monitoring barrier health are integral for disease modelling, diagnostics and drug screening applications. To date, gold standard electrical methods for detecting barrier resistance require rigid electrodes bathed in an electrolyte, which limits compatibility with biological architectures and is non&#8208;physiological for ALI. This work presents a flexible all&#8208;planar electronic device capable of monitoring barrier formation and perturbations in human respiratory and intestinal cells at ALI. By interrogating patient samples with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and simple equivalent circuit models, disease&#8208;specific and patient&#8208;specific signatures have been uncovered. Device readouts are validated against commercially available chopstick electrodes and show greater conformability, sensitivity and biocompatibility. The effect of electrode size on sensing efficiency is investigated and a cut&#8208;off sensing area is established, which is one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. This work provides first steps in creating a physiologically relevant sensor capable of mapping local and real&#8208;time changes of epithelial barrier function at ALI, which will have broad applications in toxicology and drug screening applications.

         <title>Micro&#8208;to&#8208;Nano Oncolytic Microbial System Shifts from Tumor Killing to Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes Remolding for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial system to exert tumor killing and remold tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Under laser irradiation, the &#8220;microscale&#8221; Escherichia coli (EcP) is triggered to secret the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Meanwhile, EcP generates toxic H2O2 and leads to the release of tumor antigens. The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs regulates the TDLNs immunomicroenvironment, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) to potentiate antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Because the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) microenvironment is commonly immunosuppressive, oncolytic microbe&#8208;induced tumor antigens aren't sufficiently cross&#8208;primed tumor specific T cells through antigen&#8208;presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) in TDLNs. Herein, this work develops the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial therapeutics based on pyranose oxidase (P2O) overexpressed Escherichia coli (EcP) which are simultaneously encapsulated by PEGylated mannose and low&#8208;concentrated photosensitizer nanoparticles (NPs). Following administration, P2O from this system generates toxic hydrogen peroxide for tumor regression and leads to the release of tumor antigens. The &#8220;microscale&#8221; EcP is triggered, following exposure to the laser irradiation, to secrete the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs significantly regulates the TDLNs immunomicroenvironment, promoting the maturation of DCs to potentiate tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cells immune response. The micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbe is leveraged to exert tumor killing and remold TDLNs for initiating potent activation of DCs, providing promising strategies to facilitate microbial cancer vaccination.

The micro-to-nano oncolytic microbe is leveraged to exert tumor killing and remold TDLNs for initiating potent activation of DCs, providing promising strategies to facilitate microbial cancer vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to Dimethylfuran in Neutral Electrolytes via Hydrogen Spillover and Adsorption Configuration Adjustment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural reduction reaction&#160;in neutral electrolytes to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran is a challenging reaction. Loaded palladium (Pd) single atoms enable the adsorbed hydrogen (*H) spillover to increase the *H coverage on titanium dioxide (TiO2) and maintain the tilted configuration to activate the C&#9552;O bond, thus promoting selective electro&#8208;reduction to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran. Besides, the selective electro&#8208;reduction to bis(hydroxymethyl)hydro&#8208;furoin or 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran can also be achieved on TiO2 or Pd nanoparticles loaded on Vulcan&#8208;XC72.








Abstract
5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the essential C6 biomass derivatives, has been deeply investigated in electrocatalytic reduction upgrading. Nevertheless, the high product selectivity and rational design strategy of electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic HMF reduction is still a challenge. Here, a high selective electro&#8208;reduction of HMF to dimethylfuran (DMF) on palladium (Pd) single atom loaded on titanium dioxide&#160;(Pd SA/TiO2) via hydrogen spillover and adsorption configuration adjustment in neutral electrolytes is achieved. Combining density functional theory calculations and in situ characterization, it is revealed that Pd single atom&#160;could weaken the interaction between Pd atoms and adsorbed hydrogen (*H) to promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface and maintain the tilted adsorption configuration to activate C&#9552;O bond; thus the selectivity of DMF on Pd SA/TiO2 increases to 90.33%. Besides, it is elaborated that low *H coverage on TiO2 favors the formation of bis(hydroxymethyl)hydro&#8208;furoin (BHH), and the flat adsorption configuration of HMF on Pd nanoparticles benefits to form 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF). This work provides a promising approach for modifying electrocatalysts to realize the selective electroreduction of HMF to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Split&#8208;Type Magnetic Soft Tactile Sensor with 3D Force Decoupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensor has a sandwich&#8208;like layered structure, the top layer of which is a centripetally magnetized flexible magnetic film. It can realize the self&#8208;decoupling measurement of 3D forces and be used as a human&#8211;machine interface to control a robot. After replacing the flexible substrate, the split&#8208;type sensor enables flow rate measurement for route calculation and navigation on the water.








Abstract
Tactile sensory organs for sensing 3D force, such as human skin and fish lateral lines, are indispensable for organisms. With their sensory properties enhanced by layered structures, typical sensory organs can achieve excellent perception as well as protection under frequent mechanical contact. Here, inspired by these layered structures, a split&#8208;type magnetic soft tactile sensor with wireless 3D force sensing and a high accuracy (1.33%) fabricated by developing a centripetal magnetization arrangement and theoretical decoupling model is introduced. The 3D force decoupling capability enables it to achieve a perception close to that of human skin in multiple dimensions without complex calibration. Benefiting from the 3D force decoupling capability and split design with a long effective distance (&gt;20&#160;mm), several sensors are assembled in air and water to achieve delicate robotic operation and water flow&#8208;based navigation with an offset &lt;1.03%, illustrating the extensive potential of magnetic tactile sensors in flexible electronics, human&#8210;machine interactions, and bionic robots.

         <title>Lewis Acid Driving Asymmetric Interfacial Electron Distribution to Stabilize Active Species for Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A built&#8208;in electric field between Ni&#8208;FeWO4 and WO3 simultaneously achieves the electron&#8208;rich state of the Fe sites in tungstate and improvement of the local reaction environment to suppress Fe leaching and accelerate mass transfer during neutral water oxidation, which endows the membrane electrode assembly constructed of Ni&#8208;FeWO4@WO3/NF with low cell voltages and robust stability for neutral seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Neutral oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with unique reactive environments exhibits extremely slow reaction kinetics, posing significant challenges in the design of catalysts. Herein, a built&#8208;in electric field between the tungstate (Ni&#8208;FeWO4) with adjustable work function and Lewis acid WO3 is elaborately constructed to regulate asymmetric interfacial electron distribution, which promotes electron accumulation of Fe sites in the tungstate. This decelerates the rapid dissolution of Fe under the OER potentials, thereby retaining the active hydroxyl oxide with the optimized OER reaction pathway. Meanwhile, Lewis acid WO3 enhances hydroxyl adsorption near the electrode surface to improve mass transfer. As expected, the optimized Ni&#8208;FeWO4@WO3/NF self&#8208;supporting electrode achieves a low overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and maintains stable operation for 200 h. Furthermore, the membrane electrode assembly constructed by such self&#8208;supporting electrode exhibits robust stability for 250 h during neutral seawater electrolysis. This work deepens the understanding of the reconstruction of OER catalysts in neutral environments and paves the way for development of the energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Discovering Process Dynamics for Scalable Perovskite Solar Cell Manufacturing with Explainable AI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study utilizes deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand and optimize the perovskite thin&#8208;film formation process for scalable solar cell manufacturing. Based on the findings of the algorithms and the interpretations of the material scientists, can be derived new insights and recommendations paving the way toward improved industrial&#8208;scale solar cell manufacturing.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area processing of perovskite semiconductor thin&#8208;films is complex and&#160;evokes unexplained variance in quality, posing a major hurdle for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Advances in scalable fabrication processes are currently limited to gradual and arbitrary trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures. While the in situ acquisition of photoluminescence (PL) videos has the potential to reveal important variations in the thin&#8208;film formation process, the high dimensionality of the data quickly surpasses the limits of human analysis. In response, this study leverages deep learning (DL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to discover relationships between sensor information acquired during the perovskite thin&#8208;film formation process and the resulting solar cell performance indicators, while rendering these relationships humanly understandable. The study further shows how gained insights can be distilled into actionable recommendations for perovskite thin&#8208;film processing, advancing toward industrial&#8208;scale solar cell manufacturing. This study demonstrates that XAI methods will play a critical role in accelerating energy materials science.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride Slab Waveguides for Enhanced Spectroscopy of Encapsulated 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, optical coupling of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab waveguides is studied. The hBN encapsulation provides a pristine dielectric environment around the TMD, while simultaneously providing optical access via waveguiding. The work comprises combined experimental and theoretical approaches, offering essential details necessary to leverage hBN slab waveguides in future research and applications.








Abstract
The layered insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a critical substrate that brings out the exceptional intrinsic properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, the authors demonstrate how hBN slabs tuned to the correct thickness act as optical waveguides, enabling direct optical coupling of light emission from encapsulated layers into waveguide modes. Molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2) are integrated within hBN&#8208;based waveguides and demonstrate direct coupling of photoluminescence emitted by in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane transition dipoles (bright and dark excitons) to slab waveguide modes. Fourier plane imaging of waveguided photoluminescence from MoSe2 demonstrates that dry etched hBN edges are an effective out&#8208;coupler of waveguided light without the need for oil&#8208;immersion optics. Gated photoluminescence of WSe2 demonstrates the ability of hBN waveguides to collect light emitted by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dark excitons.Numerical simulations explore the parameters of dipole placement and slab thickness, elucidating the critical design parameters and serving as a guide for novel devices implementing hBN slab waveguides. The results provide a direct route for waveguide&#8208;based interrogation of layered materials, as well as a way to integrate layered materials into future photonic devices at arbitrary positions whilst maintaining their intrinsic properties.

The hBN encapsulation provides a pristine dielectric environment around the TMD, while simultaneously providing optical access via waveguiding. The work comprises combined experimental and theoretical approaches, offering essential details necessary to leverage hBN slab waveguides in future research and applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layered insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a critical substrate that brings out the exceptional intrinsic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, the authors demonstrate how hBN slabs tuned to the correct thickness act as optical waveguides, enabling direct optical coupling of light emission from encapsulated layers into waveguide modes. Molybdenum selenide (MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and tungsten selenide (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are integrated within hBN-based waveguides and demonstrate direct coupling of photoluminescence emitted by in-plane and out-of-plane transition dipoles (bright and dark excitons) to slab waveguide modes. Fourier plane imaging of waveguided photoluminescence from MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates that dry etched hBN edges are an effective out-coupler of waveguided light without the need for oil-immersion optics. Gated photoluminescence of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates the ability of hBN waveguides to collect light emitted by out-of-plane dark excitons.Numerical simulations explore the parameters of dipole placement and slab thickness, elucidating the critical design parameters and serving as a guide for novel devices implementing hBN slab waveguides. The results provide a direct route for waveguide-based interrogation of layered materials, as well as a way to integrate layered materials into future photonic devices at arbitrary positions whilst maintaining their intrinsic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Anion&#8211;Solvent Interaction for Ultralow Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion solvation is demonstrated as a new direction to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance. The designed electrolyte with strong anion&#8211;solvent interaction enables 2.0 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 NMC811||Li (20&#160;&#181;m) full cells to achieve excellent high voltage and low temperature performance, retaining over 92% of initial capacity after 100 cycles even under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anion solvation in electrolytes can largely change the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes, yet has been rarely investigated. Herein, three anions of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), and derived asymmetric (fluorosulfonyl)(trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonyl)imide (FTFSI) are systematically examined in a weakly Li+ cation solvating solvent of bis(3&#8208;fluoropropyl)ether (BFPE). In&#8208;situ liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry demonstrates that FTFSI&#8722; and FSI&#8722; anions are associated with BFPE solvent, while weak TFSI&#8722;/BFPE cluster signals are detected. Molecular modeling further reveals that the anion&#8211;solvent interaction is accompanied by the formation of H&#8208;bonding&#8208;like interactions. Anion solvation enhances the Li+ cation transfer number and reduces the organic component in solid electrolyte interphase, which enhances the Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency at a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C from 42.4% in TFSI&#8208;based electrolytes to 98.7% in 1.5&#160;m LiFTFSI and 97.9% in LiFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolytes. The anion&#8211;solvent interactions, especially asymmetric anion solvation also accelerate the Li+ desolvation kinetics. The 1.5&#160;m LiFTFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolyte with strong anion&#8211;solvent interaction enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811)||Li (20&#160;&#181;m) full cell with stable cyclability even under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, retaining over 92% of initial capacity (115 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, after 100 cycles). The anion&#8211;solvent interactions insights allow to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Nanocrystalline Graphite Matrix C/C Composites with Excellent Ablative Resistance at 3000&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing sugar&#8208;derived carbon as a dense matrix to replace petrochemicals preparing C/C composites, and this matrix exhibit a nanocrystalline graphite structure with excellent thermal stability. Sugar&#8208;derived carbon matrix C/C composite show excellent ablative resistance at 3000&#160;&#176;C and 10 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux. In addition, the S&#8211;C/C is suitabile for the preparation of a large and complex shaped thermal protection component.








Abstract
Sugars are renewable resources essential to human life, but they are rarely used as raw materials for the industrial production of carbon&#8208;based materials, especially for the preparation of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced carbon&#8208;matrix (C/C) composites, which are extremely useful for the semiconductor and aerospace sectors. Herein, a method utilizing sugar&#8208;derived carbon to replace petrochemicals as dense matrix to preparing C/C composites is reported. The matrix from sugar&#8208;derived C/C (S&#8211;C/C) composites has a nanocrystalline graphite structure that is highly thermally stable and effectively bonded to the carbon fibers. The mechanical properties of the S&#8211;C/C composite are comparable to those prepared from petrochemical sources; significantly, it exhibits a linear ablation rate of 0.03 mm s&#8722;1 after 200 s of ablation at 3000&#160;&#176;C in 10 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux. This new class of S&#8211;C/C is promising for use in a broad range of fields, ranging from semiconductor to aerospace.

         <title>Modular Self&#8208;Assembling Dendrimer Nanosystems for Magnetic Resonance and Multimodality Imaging of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular self&#8208;assembling dendrimer probes are developed for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) bimodality imaging of tumors. These probes show high relaxivity at high magnetic field strength, giving excellent MR imaging contrast at low Gd&#8208;doses down to 1/10th of the standard clinical dose alongside effective NIRF imaging. This study highlights the promise of self&#8208;assembling dendrimers for multimodality imaging.








Abstract
Bioimaging is a powerful tool for diagnosing tumors but remains limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Nanotechnology&#8208;based imaging probes able to accommodate abundant imaging units with different imaging modalities are particularly promising for overcoming these limitations. In addition, the nanosized imaging agents can specifically increase the contrast of tumors by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is performed on pancreatic cancer to demonstrate the use of modular amphiphilic dendrimer&#8208;based nanoprobes for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) or MR/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) multimodality imaging. Specifically, the self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic dendrimer bearing multiple Gd3+ units at its terminals, generates a nanomicellar agent exhibiting favorable relaxivity for MRI with a good safety profile. MRI reveals an up to two&#8208;fold higher contrast enhancement in tumors than in normal muscle. Encapsulating the NIRF dye within the core of the nanoprobe yields an MR/NIRF bimodal imaging agent for tumor detection that is efficient both for MRI, at Gd3+ concentrations 1/10 the standard clinical dose, and for NIRF imaging, allowing over two&#8208;fold stronger fluorescence intensities. These self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystems thus constitute effective probes for MRI and MR/NIRF multimodality imaging, offering a promising nanotechnology platform for elaborating multimodality imaging probes in biomedical applications.

         <title>Hierarchical Ohmic Contact Interface Engineering for Efficient Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ohmic contact interface is used as a bridge to connect NiMo and Ni2P, and the integrated NiMo/Ni2P bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst&#160;is prepared. Charge redistribution optimizes the free energy, and the low energy barrier property provides a fast electron transfer path. The synergy at the interface promotes the catalytic performances, and realizes the low voltage driven hydrazine&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective strategy to achieve low energy water splitting for hydrogen production. In order to realize the application of hydrazine&#8208;assisted HER system, researchers have been focusing on the development of electrocatalysts with integrated dual active sites, while the performance under high current density is still unsatisfying. In this work, hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering is designed and used as a bridge between the NiMo and Ni2P heterojunction toward industrial current density applications, with the charge transfer impedance greatly eliminated via such a pathway with low energy barrier. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the importance of charge redistribution and energy barrier at the Ohmic contact interface is investigated by significantly reducing the voltage of overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at high current density. Intriguingly, the NiMo/Ni2P hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction can drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with only 181 and 343 mV cell voltage in the OHzS electrolyzer with high electrocatalytic stability. The proposed hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering paves new avenue for hydrogen production with low energy consumption.

Intriguingly, the NiMo/Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction can drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with only 181 and 343 mV cell voltage in the OHzS electrolyzer with high electrocatalytic stability. The proposed hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering paves new avenue for hydrogen production with low energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Polaritonic Effects in Cavity&#8208;Modified Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong light&#8208;matter coupling might modify material properties including chemical processes. Here, the first vacuum&#8208;modified chemistry experiment, studying cavity&#8208;modified photochemistry, is re&#8208;examined. Changes in photoisomerization rate are explained by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the cavity with no evidence that these changes need to be attributed to strong coupling. This work highlights the importance of systematic experimentation to rule out non&#8208;polaritonic effects.








Abstract
Strong coupling of molecules to vacuum fields is widely reported to lead to modified chemical properties such as reaction rates. However, some recent attempts to reproduce infrared strong coupling results have not been successful, suggesting that factors other than strong coupling may sometimes be involved. In the first vacuum&#8208;modified chemistry experiment, changes to a molecular photoisomerization process in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectral range are attributed to strong coupling of the molecules to visible light. Here, this process is re&#8208;examined, finding significant variations in photoisomerization rates consistent with the original work. However, there is no evidence that these changes need to be attributed to strong coupling. Instead, it is suggested that the photoisomerization rates involved are most strongly influenced by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the cavity. These results indicate that care must be taken to rule out non&#8208;polaritonic effects before invoking strong coupling to explain any changes of properties arising in cavity&#8208;based&#160;experiments.

         <title>Stepless IR Chromism in Ti3C2Tx MXene Tuned by Interlayer Water Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepless and reversible emissivity modulation with a broad range (&gt;50%) is revealed in stacked 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules in the interlayers. This phenomenon can keep the human body in thermal comfort when changing metabolic rates (&#8776;20%) and environmental temperatures (&#8776;3 &#176;C) and show great potential in on&#8208;demand passive radiation modulation of other applications.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time control over infrared (IR) radiation of objects is highly desired in a variety of areas such as personal thermal regulation and IR camouflage. This requires the dynamic modulation of IR emissivity in a stepless manner over a wide range (&gt;50%), which remains a daunting challenge. Here, an emissivity modulation phenomenon is reported in stacked 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, from 12% to 68% as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules within the interlayers. The intercalation of water molecules dynamically changes the electronic properties and the complex permittivity in IR frequencies of Ti3C2Tx. This emissivity modulation is a stepless and reversible process without the assistance of any external energy input. Further, intercalating cellulose nanofibers into the Ti3C2Tx interlayers makes this dynamic process highly repeatable. Last, a sweat&#8208;responsive adaptive textile that can improve thermal comfort of human body under changes in metabolic rates and environmental conditions is demonstrated, showing great potential of this mechanism in passive on&#8208;demand radiation modulation.

         <title>PCNA as Protein&#8208;Based Nanoruler for Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging super&#8208;resolution microscopy methods achieve sub&#8208;10 nm resolution, necessitating validation on suitable references structures. Here, a protein&#8208;based Imaging Calibration Optical Ruler (PicoRuler) created by site&#8208;specific labeling of PCNA through Genetic Code Expansion and bioorthogonal click chemistry is introduced. The interaction among three fluorophores separated by 6 nm can be analysed by photoswitching fingerprint analysis and their distance resolved via DNA&#8208;PAINT.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy has revolutionized biological imaging enabling direct insight into cellular structures and protein arrangements with so far unmatched spatial resolution. Today, refined single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy methods achieve spatial resolutions in the one&#8208;digit nanometer range. As the race for molecular resolution fluorescence imaging with visible light continues, reliable biologically compatible reference structures will become essential to validate the resolution power. Here, PicoRulers (protein&#8208;based imaging calibration optical rulers), multilabeled oligomeric proteins designed as advanced molecular nanorulers for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging are introduced. Genetic code expansion (GCE) is used to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into the homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at 6&#160;nm distances. Bioorthogonal click labeling with tetrazine&#8208;dyes and tetrazine&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides allows efficient labeling of the PicoRuler with minimal linkage error. Time&#8208;resolved photoswitching fingerprint analysis is used to demonstrate the successful synthesis and DNA&#8208;based points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA&#8208;PAINT) is used to resolve 6&#160;nm PCNA PicoRulers. Since PicoRulers maintain their structural integrity under cellular conditions they represent ideal molecular nanorulers for benchmarking the performance of super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, particularly in complex biological environments.

         <title>Employing Noble Metal&#8211;Porphyrins to Engineer Robust and Highly Active Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Targeted Catalytic Therapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal&#8211;porphyrins based MOFs (MxP, x denoting Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd) is prepared to fabricate highly active and stable single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes). Among these, MIrP demonstrates excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity (685.61 U mg&#8722;1) and chemical stability. Through modification with (&#8722;)&#8208;Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;Gallate, a targeted SANzyme tailored for EBV&#8208;associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma is engineered.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes) emerge as promising alternatives to conventional enzymes. However, chemical instability limits their application. Here, a systematic synthesis of highly active and stable SANzymes is presented by leveraging noble metal&#8211;porphyrins. Four noble metal&#8211;porphyrins are successfully synthesized to mimic the active site of natural peroxidases through atomic metal&#8211;N coordination anchored to the porphyrin center. These noble metal&#8211;porphyrins are integrated into a stable and biocompatible Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MxP, x denoting Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd). Among these, MIrP demonstrates superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity (685.61 U mg&#8722;1), catalytic efficiency, and selectivity compared to horseradish peroxidase (267.71 U mg&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations unveil heightened catalytic activity of MIrP arises from its robust H2O2 adsorption capacity, unique rate&#8208;determining step, and low energy threshold. Crucially, MIrP exhibits remarkable chemical stability under both room temperature and high H2O2 concentrations. Further, through modification with (&#8722;)&#8208;Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;Gallate, a natural ligand for Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;encoded latent membrane protein 1, targeted SANzyme (MIrPHE) tailored for EBV&#8208;associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma is engineered. This study not only presents an innovative strategy for augmenting the catalytic activity and chemical stability of SANzymes but also highlights the substantial potential of MIrP as a potent nanomedicine for targeted catalytic tumor therapy.

Abstract
The reversal of halide ions has been studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localisation of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) could be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS could eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice could mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W/cm2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder was estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain was 0.23%. However, in&#8208;situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increased the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in&#8208;situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

         <title>Light Sheet&#8208;Based Laser Patterning Bioprinting Produces Long&#8208;Term Viable Full&#8208;Thickness Skin Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article delves into the realm of tissue engineering and advanced bioprinting. It introduces an integrated fluorescent light sheet bioprinting system, boasting rapid printing (0.66 mm3&#160;s&#8315;1) and high resolution (9 &#181;m) alongside fluorescence light sheet&#8208;based imaging. The approach employs dual illumination for confined voxel crosslinking. High viability (83% &#177; 4.34%) of bioprinted cells and full&#8208;thickness skin constructs is shown.








Abstract
Tissue engineering holds great promise for biomedical research and healthcare, offering alternatives to animal models and enabling tissue regeneration and organ transplantation. 3D bioprinting stands out for its design flexibility and reproducibility. Here, an integrated fluorescent light sheet bioprinting and imaging system is presented that combines high printing speed (0.66 mm3/s) and resolution (9&#160;&#181;m) with light sheet&#8208;based imaging. This approach employs direct laser patterning and a static light sheet for confined voxel crosslinking in photocrosslinkable materials. The developed bioprinter enables real&#8208;time monitoring of hydrogel crosslinking using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and brightfield imaging as well as in situ light sheet imaging of cells. Human fibroblasts encapsulated in a thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry&#8208;based hydrogel exhibited high viability (83% &#177; 4.34%) and functionality. Furthermore, full&#8208;thickness skin constructs displayed characteristics of both epidermal and dermal layers and remained viable for 41 days. The integrated approach demonstrates the capabilities of light sheet bioprinting, offering high speed, resolution, and real&#8208;time characterization. Future enhancements involving solid&#8208;state laser scanning devices such as acousto&#8208;optic deflectors and modulators will further enhance resolution and speed, opening new opportunities in light&#8208;based bioprinting and advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Fully Conjugated 2D sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the electronic structure and promoting charge separation, thereby enabling overall water splitting. The crystallinity of COFs is further shown to substantially impact their photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. However, metal&#8208;free COFs for photocatalytic overall water splitting remain elusive, primarily due to challenges in simultaneously regulating their band structures and catalytic sites to enable concurrent half&#8208;reactions. Herein, two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs containing the same donor&#8211;acceptor structure are constructed via Knoevenagel condensation and Schiff base reaction to afford cyanovinylene&#8208; and imine&#8208;bridged COFs, respectively. The difference in the linkage leads to a remarkable difference in their photocatalytic activity toward water splitting. The 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF exhibits notable activity for photocatalytic overall water splitting, which can reach an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.53% at 420&#160;nm. In contrast, the 2D imine&#8208;linked COF cannot catalyze the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the band structure and promoting charge separation in COFs, thereby enabling overall water splitting. Moreover, it is further shown that crystallinity substantially impacts the photocatalytic performance of COFs. This study represents the first successful example of developing metal&#8208;free COFs with high crystallinity for photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Spinning a Liquid Wheel and Driving Surface Thermomagnetic Convection with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A laser beam can produce not only a double&#8208;eye vortex but also prompt liquid rotation resembling a windmill. These occurrences signify the presence of thermomagnetic convection in ferrofluids. Surface thermomagnetic convection is achieved by mitigating Marangoni convection, while the spinning ferrofluid exemplifies a Tesla thermomagnetic engine, facilitated by its heightened viscosity under the influence of a strong magnetic field.








Abstract
A typical Tesla thermomagnetic engine employs a solid magnetic wheel to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, while thermomagnetic convection in ferrofluid is still challenging to observe because it is a volume convection that occurs in an enclosed space. Using a water&#8208;based ferrofluid, a liquid Tesla thermomagnetic engine is demonstrated and reports the observation of thermomagnetic convection on a free surface. Both types of fluid motions are driven by light and observed by simply placing ferrofluid on a cylindrical magnet. The surface thermomagnetic convection on the free surface is made possible by eliminating the Marangoni effect, while the spinning of the liquid wheel is achieved through the solid&#8208;like behavior of the ferrofluid under a strong magnetic field. Increasing the magnetic field reveals a transition from simple thermomagnetic convection to a combination of the central spin of the spiky wheel surrounded by thermomagnetic convection in the outer region of the ferrofluid. The coupling between multiple ferrofluid wheels through a fluid bridge is further demonstrated. These demonstrations not only unveil the unique properties of ferrofluid but also provide a new platform for studying complex fluid dynamics and thermomagnetic convection, opening up exciting opportunities for light&#8208;controlled fluid actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Reducing Gases Triggered Cathode Surface Reconstruction for Stable Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface in Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the significant influence of surface chemistry of oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The interface between cathode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte is primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup. Therefore, a surface reconstruction strategy based on a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction is introduced as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.








Abstract
The interfacial compatibility between cathodes and sulfide solid&#8208;electrolytes (SEs) is a critical limiting factor of electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs). This work presents a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction (GSIRR), aiming to mitigate the reactivity of surface oxygen by inducing a surface reconstruction layer (SRL) . The application of a SRL, CoO/Li2CO3, onto LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode results in impressive outcomes, including high capacity (149.7 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable cyclability (retention of 84.63% over 400 cycles at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capability (86.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C), and exceptional stability in high&#8208;loading cathode (28.97 and 23.45&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) within ASSLBs. Furthermore, the SRL CoO/Li2CO3 enhances the interfacial stability between LCO and Li10GeP2S12 as well as Li3PS4 SEs. Significantly, the experiments suggest that the GSIRR mechanism can be broadly applied, not only to LCO cathodes but also to LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and other reducing gases such as H2S and CO, indicating its practical universality. This study highlights the significant influence of the surface chemistry of the oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility, and introduces a surface reconstruction strategy based on the GSIRR process as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Artificial Tendrils with Asymmetric Core&#8211;Sheath Structure Showing Evolutionary Biomimetic Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer artificial tendrils are elaborately designed to possess an asymmetric core&#8211;sheath architecture with differential degrees of mesogen orientation between the sheath and core layers across the semi&#8208;ellipse cross&#8208;section, which are not only capable of mimicking the helical deformation of natural tendrils but also able to be reprogrammed based on metallosupramolecular interactions to perform evolutionary flagellum&#8208;like locomotion.








Abstract
The sophisticated and complex haptonastic movements in response to environmental&#8208;stimuli of living organisms have always fascinated scientists. However, how to fundamentally mimic the sophisticated hierarchical architectures of living organisms to provide the artificial counterparts with similar or even beyond&#8208;natural functions based on the underlying mechanism remains a major scientific challenge. Here,&#160; liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) artificial tendrils showing evolutionary biomimetic locomotion are developed following the structure&#8211;function principle that is used in nature to grow climbing plants. These elaborately designed tendril&#8208;like LCE actuators possess an asymmetric core&#8211;sheath architecture which shows a higher&#8208;to&#8208;lower transition in the degree of LC orientation from the sheath&#8208;to&#8208;core layer across the semi&#8208;ellipse cross&#8208;section. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE artificial tendril can undergo reversible tendril&#8208;like shape&#8208;morphing behaviors, such as helical coiling/winding, and perversion. The fundamental mechanism of the helical shape&#8208;morphing of the artificial tendril is revealed by using theoretical models and finite element simulations. Besides, the incorporation of metal&#8208;ligand coordination into the LCE network provides the artificial tendril with reconfigurable shape&#8208;morphing performances such as helical transitions and rotational deformations. Finally, the abilities of helical and rotational deformations are integrated into a new reprogrammed flagellum&#8208;like architecture to perform evolutionary locomotion mimicking the haptonastic movements of the natural flagellum.

         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway with Epigenetic/ Photodynamic Nanotheranostic for Enhanced Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides an exquisite strategy for concurrent photoactivation of pyroptosis and the the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway in immunosuppressive tumors to stimulate the innate immunity for subsequent priming of cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through cooperative effects of photodynamic therapy and NIR fluorescence imaging mediated by TBE&#8208;loaded NP1 and epigenetic therapy mediated by decitabine&#8208;loaded NP2.








Abstract
Promoting innate immunity through pyroptosis induction or the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING)&#160;pathway activation has emerged as a potent approach to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and elicit systemic antitumor immunity. However, current pyroptosis inducers and STING agonists often suffer from limitations including instability, unpredictable side effects, or inadequate intracellular expression of gasdermin and STING. Here, a tumor&#8208;specific nanotheranostic platform that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) with epigenetic therapy to simultaneously activate pyroptosis and the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in a light&#8208;controlled manner is constructed. This approach involves the development of oxidation&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (NP1) loaded with the photosensitizer TBE, along with decitabine nanomicelles (NP2). NP2 enables the restoration of STING and gasdermin E (GSDME) expression, while NP1&#8208;mediated PDT facilitates the release of DNA fragments from damaged mitochondria to potentiate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and promotes the activation of caspase&#8208;3 to cleave the upregulated GSDME into pore&#8208;forming GSDME&#8208;N terminal. Subsequently, the released inflammatory cytokines facilitate the maturation of antigen&#8208;presentation cells, triggering T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. Overall, this study presents an elaborate strategy for simultaneous photoactivation of pyroptosis and the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enabling targeted photoimmunotherapy in immunotolerant tumors. This innovative approach holds significant promise in overcoming the limitations associated with existing therapeutic modalities and represents a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network with Pd Nanoparticle Nodes Synergizes Oxidase&#8208;Like and Photothermal Properties to Eradicate Oral Polymicrobial Biofilm&#8208;Associated Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyphenol&#8208;palladium network with excellent oxidase&#8208;like activity and photothermal effect is constructed. The reactive oxygen species treatment mediated by the oxidase&#8208;like activity of the network exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect&#8208;induced hyperthermia possesses potent antifungal properties. Moreover, synergistic antimicrobial systems mediated by the network exhibit remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms, which can be used to treat oral biofilm&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Designing an effective treatment strategy to combat oral diseases caused by complex polymicrobial biofilms remains a great challenge. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;phenolic network with Pd nanoparticle nodes using polyphenols as stabilizers and reducing agents is constructed. Among them, sulfonated lignin&#8208;Pd (SLS&#8208;Pd) with ultrafine size palladium nanoparticles and broadband near infrared absorption exhibit excellent oxidase&#8208;like activity and stable photothermal effect. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the superoxide radical generated by SLS&#8208;Pd oxidase&#8208;like activity exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect induced hyperthermia exhibits potent antifungal properties. This difference is further elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis and all&#8208;atom simulation. Moreover, the SLS&#8208;Pd&#8208;mediated synergistic antimicrobial system exhibits remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms. By establishing a root canal model and an oropharyngeal candidiasis model, the feasibility of the synergistic antimicrobial system in treating oral biofilm&#8208;related infections is further validated. This system provides a promising therapeutic approach for polymicrobial biofilm&#8208;associated infections in the oral cavity.

         <title>Ultrahigh Capacity from Complexation&#8208;Enabled Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with C70 as the Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.








Abstract
Restricted by the available energy storage modes, currently rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RABs) can only provide a very limited experimental capacity, regardless of the very high gravimetric capacity of Al (2980&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Here, a novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. By means of in situ Raman monitoring, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that this elevated capacity is attributed to the direct complexation of one C70 molecule with 23.5 (super)halogen moieties (superhalogen AlCl4 and/or halogen Cl) in average, forming (super)halogenated C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m complexes. Upon discharging, decomplexation of C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m releases AlCl4&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ions while preserving the intact fullerene cage. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.

2D Cr2O3&#8211;CrN mosaic heterostructures consisting of a Cr2O3 flake with embedded CrN subdomains are synthesized by a designed chemical vapor deposition method. These mosaic heterostructures exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism&#160;that correlates with the interface. By changing the component ratio of CrN and Cr2O3 in mosaic heterostructures, the magnetic properties can be modulated.








Abstract
2D magnets have generated much attention due to their potential for spintronic devices. Heterostructures of 2D magnets are interesting platforms for exploring physical phenomena and applications. However, the controlled growth of 2D room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic heterostructures is challenging. Here, one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition growth of stable 2D Cr2O3&#8211;CrN mosaic heterostructures (MHs) is reported with a controlled ratio of components that possess robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. The 2D MHs consist of Cr2O3 flakes with embedded CrN subdomains and the CrN:Cr2O3 ratio can be tuned from 0% to 100% during growth. By changing the CrN:Cr2O3 ratio, the ferromagnetism of the MHs (e.g., saturation magnetization, coercive field), which originates from the interfacial coupling between Cr2O3 and CrN, can be controlled. Importantly, the obtained Cr2O3&#8211;CrN MHs are stable in air at elevated temperatures and have robust ferromagnetism with Curie temperature &gt;400&#160;K. This work presents a facile method for fabricating 2D MHs with tunable magnetism which will benefit high&#8208;temperature spintronics.

         <title>Tough and Moldable Sustainable Cellulose&#8208;Based Structural Materials via Multiscale Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance multiscale cellulose&#8208;based structural material is constructed through a multiscale interface engineering strategy. The positive and negative charges treatment of microfibers and nanofibers effectively solves the interface bonding problem in multiscale design, and allows them to be easily shaped into complex three&#8208;dimensional special&#8208;shaped structures. This sustainable material offers superior mechanical and thermal properties compared to petrochemical&#8208;based plastics.








Abstract
All&#8208;natural materials derived from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are expected to be used to replace engineering plastics and have attracted much attention. However, the lack of crack extension resistance and 3D formability of nanofiber&#8208;based structural materials hinders their practical applications. Here, a multiscale interface engineering strategy is reported to construct high&#8208;performance cellulose&#8208;based materials. The sisal microfibers are surface treated to expose abundant active CNFs with positive charges, thereby enhancing their interfacial combination with the negatively charged CNFs. The robust multiscale dual network enables easy molding of multiscale cellulose&#8208;based structural materials into complex 3D special&#8208;shaped structures, resulting in nearly twofold and fivefold improvements in toughness and impact resistance compared with those of CNFs&#8208;based materials. Moreover, this multiscale interface engineering strategy endows cellulose&#8208;based structural materials with better comprehensive performance than petrochemical&#8208;based plastics and broadens cellulose's potential for lightweight applications as structural materials with lower environmental effects.

         <title>Control of Mechanical and Fracture Properties in Two&#8208;Phase Materials Reinforced by Continuous, Irregular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the local architecture of irregular materials, the mechanisms that cause their fracture and design materials that dissipate up to 120% more energy can be influenced. By carefully designing multi&#8208;architecture assemblies, composed of soft and stiff domains, the trajectories of growing cracks, and control their deflection and nucleation can be influenced.








Abstract
Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, the fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of the topology of their irregular microstructures is studied. A stochastic algorithm is used to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, the mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites are tailored&#160;at the local and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a spatially determined meso&#8208;scale assembly, it is demonstrated how the spatial propagation of fracture in architected composite materials can be designed and controlled a priori.

         <title>Revealing the Mutually Enhanced Mechanism of Necroptosis and Immunotherapy Induced by Defect Engineering and Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies show a high piezocatalytic effect. Reactive oxygen species and overloaded Ca2+ upregulate the expression of RIPK3 and MIKL proteins, inducing the onset of necroptosis. Necroptosis induces a robust immune response by inducing DC maturation and macrophage M1 polarization. The secreted cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; again enhances necroptosis. A mutual enhancement is thereby achieved.








Abstract
Owing to low immunogenicity&#8208;induced immune escape and short&#8208;term circulating immune responses, the efficiency of immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Therefore, triggering immunogenic cell death and establishing a long&#8208;term, mutually reinforced treatment modality are urgent challenges. In this study, ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with tunable oxygen vacancies (abbreviated as CBNO&#8208;OV1) are prepared for synergistic necroptosis and immunotherapy. The optimized vacancy concentration significantly improves the piezoelectric effect under ultrasound irradiation, thereby considerably improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Density functional theory shows that oxygen vacancies can improve the efficiency of electron hole separation by suppressing their recombination, thus resulting in enhanced piezocatalytic activity. Moreover, the piezoelectric effect improves the permeability of tumor cell membranes, thus resulting in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, CBNO&#8208;OV1 also releases a portion of Ca2+, which induces necroptosis assisted by explosive ROS. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests suggest the mechanisms associated with immune response activation and necroptosis. More importantly, necroptosis can trigger a significant immune response in vivo, thus activating macrophage M1 polarization through the NF&#8208;kappa B pathway and promoting T&#8208;cell differentiation.Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945; differentiated from macrophages conversely promotes necroptosis, thus realizing a mutually enhanced effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mutually reinforced necroptosis and immunotherapy for amplifying tumor efficacy.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are constructed to achieve spatiotemporal orchestration of innate immune stimulation by harnessing STING and TLR4 pathways. MPLA&#8208;mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B amplifies STING signaling to promote the secretion of IFN&#8208;&#946; and other inflammatory cytokines, relieving the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment and thus effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) are exploited that simultaneously harness STING and Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4&#8208;mediated nuclear factor&#8208;kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0&#8208;fold enhancement of IFN&#8208;&#946;) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieve the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of regulatory T cells, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune&#8208;supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, synergistic efficacy is achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and noninflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor&#8208;free animals with homotypic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory. These TME&#8208;responsive nanoparticles may open a new avenue to achieve the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING activation, providing a promising clinical candidate for next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Diversity of Coke Deposits on Nanoprinted Metal Catalysts Visualized by Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coke formation is a prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon products block the catalytic active sites and impede further reaction. Herein, the nanofabrication of metal catalysts is synergized with advanced coke characterization via tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This approach reveals the chemical diversity of coke deposits at the nanoscale, opening novel routes for extending the catalyst's lifespan.








Abstract
Coke formation is the prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon wastes block the catalyst surface and hinder further reaction in a broad gamut of industrial chemical processes. Yet, the origins of coke formation and their distribution across the catalyst remain elusive, obstructing the design of coke&#8208;resistant catalysts. Here, the first&#8208;time application of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is demonstrated as a nanoscale chemical probe to localize and identify coke deposits on a post&#8208;mortem metal nanocatalyst. Monitoring coke at the nanoscale circumvents bulk averaging and reveals the local nature of coke with unmatched detail. The nature of coke is chemically diverse and ranges from nanocrystalline graphite to disordered and polymeric coke, even on a single nanoscale location of a top&#8208;down nanoprinted SiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. Surprisingly, not all Pt is an equal producer of coke, where clear isolated coke &#8220;hotspots&#8221; are present non&#8208;homogeneously on Pt which generate large amounts of disordered coke. After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long&#8208;range transport on the surrounding SiO2 surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free&#8208;up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long&#8208;term catalyst stability.

         <title>Selectively Modulating Componential Morphologies of Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared photon&#8208;assisted annealing facilitates high&#8208;performance binary organic solar cells with an impressive efficiency of 19.25% under mild conditions, which allows selectively tuning the molecular ordering of narrow bandgap acceptors within polymer networks to achieve optimal morphologies.








Abstract
Achieving precise control over the nanoscale morphology of bulk heterojunction films presents a significant challenge for the conventional post&#8208;treatments employed in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a near&#8208;infrared photon&#8208;assisted annealing (NPA) strategy is developed for fabricating high&#8208;performance OSCs under mild processing conditions. It is revealed a top NIR light illumination, together with the bottom heating, enables the selective tuning of the molecular arrangement and assembly of narrow bandgap acceptors in polymer networks to achieve optimal morphologies, as well as the acceptor&#8208;rich top surface of active layers. The derived OSCs exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.25%, representing one of the highest PCEs for the reported binary OSCs so far. Moreover, via the NPA strategy, it has succeeded in accessing top&#8208;illuminated flexible OSCs using thermolabile polyethylene terephthalate from mineral water bottles, displaying excellent mechanical stabilities. Overall, this work will hold the potential to develop organic solar cells under mild processing with various substrates.

         <title>Rechargeable Li/Cl2 Battery Down to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a &#8722;80 &#176;C &#8776;4.0 V rechargeable lithium/chlorine battery with a 1200&#8211;5000 mAh g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over up to 130 cycles, employing the newly engineered porous carbon cathode and SOCl2&#8208;based electrolyte. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry reveal the highly reversible LiCl/Cl2 redox reactions and trapping mechanism of reactive species at &#8722;40 &#176;C to &#8722;80 &#176;C.








Abstract
Low temperature rechargeable batteries are important to life in cold climates, polar/deep&#8208;sea expeditions, and space explorations. Here, this work reports 3.5&#8211;4&#160;V rechargeable lithium/chlorine (Li/Cl2) batteries operating down to &#8722;80 &#176;C, employing Li metal negative electrode, a novel carbon dioxide (CO2) activated porous carbon (KJCO2) as the positive electrode, and a high ionic conductivity (&#8776;5&#8211;20 mS cm&#8722;1 from &#8722;80 &#176;C to room&#8208;temperature) electrolyte comprised of aluminum chloride (AlCl3), lithium chloride (LiCl), and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in low&#8208;melting&#8208;point (&#8722;104.5 &#176;C) thionyl chloride (SOCl2). Between room&#8208;temperature and &#8722;80 &#176;C, the Li/Cl2 battery delivers up to &#8776;29&#160;100&#8211;4500 mAh g&#8722;1 first discharge capacity (based on carbon mass) and a 1200&#8211;5000 mAh g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over up to 130 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy probe Cl2 trapped in the porous carbon upon LiCl electro&#8208;oxidation during charging. At &#8722;80 &#176;C, Cl2/SCl2/S2Cl2 generated by electro&#8208;oxidation in the charging step are trapped in porous KJCO2 carbon, allowing for reversible reduction to afford a high discharge voltage plateau near &#8776;4&#160;V with up to &#8776;1000 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity for SCl2/S2Cl2 reduction and up to &#8776;4000 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity at &#8776;3.1&#160;V plateau for Cl2 reduction.

         <title>Highly Bright and Stable Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terbium doping and guest&#8211;host strategy are adopted to substantially enhance STEradiative recombination and charge injection efficiency in lead&#8208;free DP emitting layer. Consequently, a record luminance of 2793&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and EQE of 0.76% for the constructed white LED are reported, substantially surpassing those of recently reported DP&#8208;based EL devices.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites (DPs) are emerging highly stable emitters with efficient broadband self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) photoluminescence (PL), but their low electroluminescent (EL) efficiency is a critical shortcoming. This work promotes the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance of DP&#8208;based white light&#8208;emitting diode (wLED) with a normal device structure to 0.76% and 2793&#160;cd m&#8722;2 via two modifications: This work prevents the formation of adverse metallic silver, spatially confined STE, and lowers local site symmetry in Cs2Na0.4Ag0.6In0.97Bi0.03Cl6 DP by terbium doping; and this work develops a guest&#8211;host strategy to improve film morphology, reduce defect density, and increase carrier mobility. These alterations cause substantial increase in STE radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency of perovskite layer. Finally, pure white EL with ideal color coordinates of (0.328, 0.329) and a record&#8208;breaking optoelectronic performance is achieved by introducing additional green carbon dots in LED to fill the deficient green component.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Effect Coupling for Superior Dielectric and Thermal Conductivity of Polyimide Composite Films Featuring &#8220;Crystal&#8208;Like Phase&#8221; Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the dual action of calcium fluoride and ionic liquid on the polyimide (PI) matrix, the 3D porous thermal conductivity network and special &#8220;crystal&#8208;like phase&#8221; structures are constructed in PI. These endow the PI materials with highly efficient low dielectric and thermal conductivity properties to better serve the electrical and electronic fields.








Abstract
To match the increasing miniaturization and integration of electronic devices, higher requirements are put on the dielectric and thermal properties of the dielectrics to overcome the problems of delayed signal transmission and heat accumulation.

&lt;p&gt;Through the dual action of calcium fluoride and ionic liquid on the polyimide (PI) matrix, the 3D porous thermal conductivity network and special &#8220;crystal-like phase&#8221; structures are constructed in PI. These endow the PI materials with highly efficient low dielectric and thermal conductivity properties to better serve the electrical and electronic fields.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Binary and Ternary Organic Solar Cells Based on Novel Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors are synthesized, and the influence of different end groups and side chains on their performance is investigated. Among them, 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F&#8208;based devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 13.03%. Furthermore, utilizing 2TT as the third component, a highly efficient ternary organic solar cell with an impressive efficiency of 19.39% is constructed, which is among the highest reported values.








Abstract
In this study, three nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (2TT, 2TT&#8208;C6&#8208;F, and 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F) with the same steric hindrance groups (2,4,6&#8208;tripropylbenzene) are designed and synthesized and the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing and lateral alkyl side chains on the performance of binary and ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) is explored. For the binary OSCs, 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F with IC&#8208;2F terminal groups and lateral undecyl side chains display a red shifted absorption spectrum and suitable energy levels, and the corresponding blend film exhibits appropriate phase separation and crystallinity. Thus, binary OSCs based on 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 13.03%, much higher than the efficiencies of those based on 2TT (9.68%) and 2TT&#8208;C6&#8208;F (12.11%). In the ternary OSCs, 2TT with CC terminal groups and lateral hexyl side chains exhibit complementary absorption and cascade energy levels with a host binary system (D18:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4F). Hence, the ternary OSCs based on 2TT achieve a remarkable efficiency of 19.39%, ranking among the highest reported values. The research yields comprehensive 2TT&#8208;series nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, demonstrating their great potential for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance binary and ternary OSCs.

         <title>Targeted Depletion of Individual Pathogen by Bacteria&#8208;Templated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform that uses bacteria as a template to synthesize guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polymers through copper catalyzed ATRP is reported. The polymers recovered from the bacterial surface show high bactericidal activity against the strains that templated them and deplete the target bacteria efficiently without significant collateral damage to complex microbial communities as compared to antibiotics.








Abstract
Selective and targeted removal of individual species or strains of bacteria from complex communities can be desirable over traditional and broadly acting antibiotics in several conditions. However, strategies that can detect and ablate bacteria with high specificity are emerging in recent years. Herein, a platform is reported that uses bacteria as a template to synthesize polymers containing guanidinium groups for self&#8208;selective depletion of specific pathogenic bacteria without disturbing microbial communities. Different from conventional antibiotics, repeated treatment of bacteria with the templated polymers does not evolve drug resistance mutants after 20 days of serial passaging. Especially, high in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of the templated polymers is achieved in E. coli&#8208; and P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced microbial peritonitis. The templated polymers have shown high selectivity in in vivo antimicrobial activity, which has excellent potential as systemic antimicrobials against bacterial infections.

         <title>Reversible Structural Evolution of Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;nitrogen doped carbon catalysts containing Co, Zn, or Cu single atomic sites in their as prepared state tend to reversibly form metallic clusters during CO2 electroreduction as evidenced by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The formed metallic cluster with the remaining single atomic species jointly determines the catalytic functionality of these materials.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a rising technology, aiming to reduce the energy sector dependence on fossil fuels and to produce carbon&#8208;neutral raw materials. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) are emerging, cost&#8208;effective catalysts for this reaction; however, their long&#8208;term stability is a major issue. To overcome this, understanding their structural evolution is crucial, requiring systematic in&#8208;depth operando studies. Here a series of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts (M = Fe, Sn, Cu, Co, Ni, Zn) is investigated using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. It is found that the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Sn&#8208;N&#8208;C are prone to oxide clusters formation even before CO2RR. In contrast, the respective metal cations are singly dispersed in the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C, Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C, and (Zn)&#8208;N&#8208;C. During CO2RR, metallic clusters/nanoparticles reversibly formed in all catalysts, except for the Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C. This phenomenon, previously observed only in Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C, thus is ubiquitous in M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. The competition between M&#8208;O and M&#8208;N interactions is an important factor determining the mobility of metal species in M&#8208;N&#8208;C. Specifically, the strong interaction between the Ni centers and the N&#8208;functional groups of the carbon support results in higher stability of the Ni single&#8208;sites, leading to the excellent performance of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C in the CO2 to CO conversion, in comparison to other transition metals.

         <title>High&#8208;Toughness and High&#8208;Strength Solvent&#8208;Free Linear Poly(ionic liquid) Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;toughness linear poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) elastomers are constructed by supramolecular ionic networks formed by radical polymerization of halometallate ionic liquids (ILs), without any chemical crosslinking. The linear PIL elastomers with good crack propagation insensitive self&#8208;healing, recyclable, and antimicrobial properties have shown broad application prospects in the field of flexible sensor devices, health monitoring, and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free elastomers, unlike gels, do not suffer from solvent evaporation and leakage in practical applications. However, it is challenging to realize the preparation of high&#8208;toughness (with both high stress and strain) ionic elastomers. Herein, high&#8208;toughness linear poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) elastomers are constructed via supramolecular ionic networks formed by the polymerization of halometallate ionic liquid (IL) monomers, without any chemical crosslinking. The obtained linear PIL elastomers exhibit high strength (16.5 MPa), Young's modulus (157.49 MPa), toughness (130.31 MJ m&#8722;3), and high crack propagation insensitivity (fracture energy 243.37 kJ m&#8722;2), owing to the enhanced intermolecular noncovalent interactions of PIL chains. Furthermore, PIL elastomer&#8208;based strain, pressure, and touch sensors have shown high sensitivity. The linear noncovalent crosslinked network endows the PIL elastomers with self&#8208;healing and recyclable properties, and broad application prospects in the fields of flexible sensor devices, health monitoring, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Pseudopolymorphic Phase Engineering for Improved Thermoelectric Performance in Copper Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material consisting of the same substance can crystalize in different structural phases with (or without) identical composition, termed &#8220;(pseudo)polymorphic phases&#8221; (PPs). This work applies this PP concept to copper sulfides to improve thermoelectric performance. The resulting PPs maintain electron transport and enhance phonon scattering. A peak ZT value of 1.25 is obtained, which is 2.3 times higher than that of pristine copper sulfide.








Abstract
Polymorphism (and its extended form &#8211; pseudopolymorphism) in solids is ubiquitous in mineralogy, crystallography, chemistry/biochemistry, materials science, and the pharmaceutical industries. Despite the difficulty of controlling (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphism, the realization of specific (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphic phases and associated boundary structures is an efficient route to enhance material performance for energy conversion and electromechanical applications. Here, this work applies the pseudopolymorphic phase (PP) concept to a thermoelectric copper sulfide, Cu2&#8208;xS (x &#8804; 0.25), via CuBr2 doping. A peak ZT value of 1.25 is obtained at 773&#160;K in Cu1.8S + 3&#160;wt% CuBr2, which is 2.3 times higher than that of a pristine Cu1.8S sample. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the transformation of pristine Cu1.8S low digenite into PP&#8208;engineered high digenite, as well as the formation of (semi&#8208;)coherent interfaces between different PPs, which is expected to enhance phonon scattering. The results demonstrate that PP engineering is an effective approach for achieving improved thermoelectric performance in Cu&#8208;S compounds. It is also expected to be useful in other materials.

         <title>Revealing the Deposition Mechanism of the Powder Aerosol Deposition Method Using Ceramic Oxide Core&#8211;Shell Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition mechanism of the powder aerosol deposition (PAD) method is still not fully understood. To tackle this issue, two different core&#8211;shell particles are deposited: Al2O3 particles with a SiO2 shell and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) particles with a LiNbO3 shell. Comparing the core&#8208;to&#8208;shell element ratio before and after deposition allows to reveil the deposition mechanism of the PAD.








Abstract
The powder aerosol deposition (PAD) method is a process to manufacture ceramic films completely at room temperature. Since the first reports by Akedo in the late 1990s, much research has been conducted to reveal the exact mechanism of the deposition process. However, it is still not fully understood. This work tackles this challenge using core&#8211;shell particles. Two coated oxides, Al2O3 core with a SiO2 shell and&#160;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 core with a LiNbO3 shell, are investigated. Initially, the element ratios Al:Si and Ni:Nb of the powder are determined by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). In a second step, the change in the element ratios of Al:Si and Ni:Nb after deposition is investigated. The element ratios from powder to film strongly shift toward the shell elements, indicating that the particles fracture and only the outer parts of the particles are deposited. In the last step, this work investigates cross&#8208;sections of the deposited films with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM combined with EDX and an energy&#8208;selective back&#8208;scattered electron (EsB) detector to unveil the element distribution within the film itself. Therefore, the following overall picture emerges: particles impact on the substrate or on previously deposited particle, fracture, and only a small part of the impacting particles that originate from the outer part of the impacting particle gets deposited.

         <title>Phenylboronic Acid Functionalized Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible solid supramolecular electrolyte that blends a new anion capture agent with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix has been prepared. This electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number of 0.70. Assembled Li|C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI|LiFePO4 cells maintains a high&#8208;performance level through 1200 cycles at 60 &#176;C and 1 C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) suffer from the low ionic conductivity and poor capability of suppressing lithium (Li) dendrites, which limits their utility in the preparation of all solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). It is reported here a flexible solid supramolecular electrolyte that incorporates a new anion capture agent, namely a phenylboronic acid functionalized calix[4]pyrrole (C4P), into a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix. The resulting solid&#8208;state supramolecular electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{\mathrm{ + }}}$&#160;=&#160;0.70). Furthermore, the assembled Li|C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI|LiFePO4 cell allows for stable cycling over 1200 cycles at 1 C at 60&#160;&#176;C, as well as good rate performance. The favorable performance of the C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI SPE leads to suggest it can prove useful in the creation of high energy density solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Fully Recyclable Cured Polymers for Sustainable 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sustainable 3D printing approach, resulting in fully recyclable thermosets with multiple printing cycles at low temperatures, is presented. This study pushes the boundaries of light&#8208;based printing technologies while introducing novel compositions and reversible photopolymerization reactions, using a microwave that enables greener and more efficient additive manufacturing without any replenishing materials for (re)printing.








Abstract
The most prevalent materials used in the Additive Manufacturing era are polymers and plastics. Unfortunately, these materials are recognized for their negative environmental impact as they are primarily nonrecyclable, resulting in environmental pollution. In recent years, a new sustainable alternative to these materials has been emerging: Reversible Covalent Bond&#8208;Containing Polymers (RCBPs). These materials can be recycled, reprocessed, and reused multiple times without losing their properties. Nonetheless, they have two significant drawbacks when used in 3D printing. First, some require adding new materials every reprinting cycle, and second, others require high temperatures for (re)printing, limiting recyclability, and increasing energy consumption. This study, thus, introduces fully recyclable RCBPs as a sustainable approach for radiation&#8208;based printing technologies. This approach enables multiple (re)printing cycles at low temperatures (50&#160;&#176;C lower than the lowest reported) without adding new materials. It involves purposefully synthesized polymers that undergo reversible photopolymerization, composed of a tin&#8208;based catalyst. An everyday microwave oven quickly depolymerized these polymers, obtaining complete reversibility.

         <title>Optimizing the Buried Interface in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve Over 24% Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by introducing &#9472;NH3+ rich proline hydrochloride as a versatile medium for buried interface in flexible perovskite solar cells, it not only provides a solid &#945;&#8208;phase FAPbI3 template but also prevents the phase transition induced degradation. A new record power conversion efficiency of 24.61% is achieved. Besides, the devices demonstrate excellent shelf&#8208;life/light soaking stability and mechanical stability.








Abstract
The buried interface of the perovskite layer has a profound influence on its film morphology, defect formation, and aging resistance from the outset, therefore, significantly affects the film quality and device performance of derived perovskite solar cells. Especially for FAPbI3, although it has excellent optoelectronic properties, the spontaneous transition from the black perovskite phase to nonperovskite phase tends to start from the buried interface at the early stage of film formation then further propagate to degrade the whole perovskite. In this work, by introducing &#9472;NH3+ rich proline hydrochloride (PF) with a conjugated rigid structure as a versatile medium for buried interface, it not only provides a solid &#945;&#8208;phase FAPbI3 template, but also prevents the phase transition induced degradation. PF also acts as an effective interfacial stress reliever to enhance both efficiency and stability of flexible solar cells. Consequently, a champion efficiency of 24.61% (certified 23.51%) can be achieved, which is the highest efficiency among all reported values for flexible perovskite solar cells. Besides, devices demonstrate excellent shelf&#8208;life/light soaking stability (advanced level of ISOS stability protocols) and mechanical stability.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Synthesis of Monolayer Graphdiyne in MXene Interlayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer graphdiyne is synthesized by in situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub&#8208;nanometer interlayer space of Mxene. Free&#8208;standing monolayer graphdiyne flakes with micrometer&#8208;scale lateral are exfoliated from MXene interlayer assisted with ion intercalation. The free&#8208;standing monolayer graphdiyne presents excellent electronic properties which are superior to various previously reported multilayer graphdiyne materials.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) is an artificial carbon allotrope that is conceptually similar to graphene but composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Monolayer GDY (ML&#8208;GDY) is predicted to be an ideal 2D semiconductor material with a wide range of applications. However, its synthesis has posed a significant challenge, leading to difficulties in experimentally validating theoretical properties. Here, it is reported that in situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub&#8208;nanometer interlayer space of MXene can effectively prevent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth or vertical stacking of the material, resulting in ML&#8208;GDY with in&#8208;plane periodicity. The subsequent exfoliation process successfully yields free&#8208;standing GDY monolayers with micrometer&#8208;scale lateral dimensions. The fabrication of field&#8208;effect transistor on free&#8208;standing ML&#8208;GDY makes the first measurement of its electronic properties possible. The measured electrical conductivity (5.1 &#215; 103 S m&#8722;1) and carrier mobility (231.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) at room temperature are remarkably higher than those of the previously reported multilayer GDY materials. The space&#8208;confined synthesis using layered crystals as templates provides a new strategy for preparing 2D materials with precisely controlled layer numbers and long&#8208;range structural order.

         <title>A Lithium Intrusion&#8208;Blocking Interfacial Shield for Wide&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Range Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency Li intrusion&#8208;blocking interfacial shield is realized for wide&#8208;pressure&#8208;range solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, consisting of high&#8208;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals and electrically insulated Li2S. Interfacial shield&#8208;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12&#8208;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability even at high pressure of 70&#160;MPa.








Abstract
Lithium garnets are considered as promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). However, the Li intrusion driven by external stack pressure triggers premature of Li metal batteries. Herein, for the first time, an in situ constructed interfacial shield is reported to efficiently inhibit the pressure&#8208;induced Li intrusion in SSLBs. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that high&#8208;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals inside the shield effectively suppress Li dendrite growth without alloy hardening&#8208;derived interfacial contact deterioration. Meanwhile the electrically insulated Li2S as a shield component considerably promotes interfacial wettability and hinders Li dendrite penetration into the bulk of garnet electrolyte. Interfacial shield&#8208;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO)&#8208;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability without short circuits under conventional pressures of &#8776;0.2&#160;MPa and even at high pressure of up to 70&#160;MPa; which is the highest endurable stack pressure reported for SSLBs using garnet electrolytes. These key findings are expected to promote the wide&#8208;pressure&#8208;range applications of SSLBs.

         <title>Multiscale Interpenetrated/Interconnected Network Design Confers All&#8208;Carbon Aerogels with Unprecedented Thermomechanical Properties for Thermal Insulation under Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially confined assembly strategy for multiscale nanocarbon building blocks is proposed to decouple stress and heat transfer. The best thermomechanical and insulation trade&#8208;off is achieved, exhibiting flyweight density, temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, and a low thermal conductivity (0.04829 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C), which provides a remarkable thermal protection material in hostile environments for future aerospace exploration.








Abstract
With ultralight weight, low thermal conductivity, and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance, carbon aerogels hold tremendous potential against severe thermal threats encountered by hypersonic vehicles during the in&#8208;orbit operation and re&#8208;entry process. However, current 3D aerogels are plagued by irreconcilable contradictions between adiabatic and mechanical performance due to monotonicity of the building blocks or uncontrollable assembly behavior. Herein, a spatially confined assembly strategy of multiscale low&#8208;dimensional nanocarbons is reported to decouple the stress and heat transfer. The nanofiber framework, a basis for transferring the loading strain, is covered by a continuous thin&#8208;film&#8208;like layer formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles, which in combination serve as the fundamental structural units for generating an elastic behavior while yielding compartments in aerogels to suppress the gaseous fluid thermal diffusion within distinct partitions. The resulting all&#8208;carbon aerogels with a hierarchical cellular structure and quasi&#8208;closed cell walls achieve the best thermomechanical and insulation trade&#8208;off, exhibiting flyweight density (24&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), temperature&#8208;constant compressibility (&#8722;196&#8211;1600 &#176;C), and a low thermal conductivity of 0.04&#160;829&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 300 &#176;C. This strategy provides a remarkable thermal protection material in hostile environments for future aerospace exploration.

         <title>Robust Molecular Anodes for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Based on Electropolymerized Molecular Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electropolymerization of thiophene monomer, containing a covalently attached Cu molecular water oxidation catalyst, on graphitic surfaces generates powerful and robust molecular anodes. Turnover numbers higher than 11&#160;000 are achieved for the oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotentials of &#8776;250&#160;mV.








Abstract
A multistep synthesis of a new tetra&#8208;amidate macrocyclic ligand functionalized with alkyl&#8208;thiophene moieties, 15,15&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)hexyl)&#8208;8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,h][1,4,7,10]tetraazacyclotridecine&#8208;6,7,14,16(15H,17H)&#8208;tetraone, H4L, is reported. The reaction of the deprotonated ligand, L4&#8722;, and Cu(II) generates the complex [LCu]2&#8722;, that can be further oxidized to Cu(III) with iodine to generate [LCu]&#8722;. The H4L ligand and their Cu complexes have been thoroughly characterized by analytic and spectroscopic techniques (including X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy, XAS). Under oxidative conditions, the thiophene group of [LCu]2&#8722; complex polymerizes on the surface of graphitic electrodes (glassy carbon disks (GC), glassy carbon plates (GCp), carbon nanotubes (CNT), or graphite felts (GF)) generating highly stable thin films. With CNTs deposited on a GC by drop casting, hybrid molecular materials labeled as GC/CNT@p&#8208;[LCu]2&#8722; are obtained. The latter are characterized by electrochemical techniques that show their capacity to electrocatalytically oxidize water to dioxygen at neutral pH. These new molecular anodes achieve current densities in the range of 0.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.30&#160;V versus NHE with an onset overpotential at &#8776;250&#160;mV. Bulk electrolysis experiments show an excellent stability achieving TONs in the range of 7600 during 24&#160;h with no apparent loss of catalytic activity and maintaining the molecular catalyst integrity, as evidenced by electrochemical techniques and XAS spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Electropolymerization of thiophene monomer, containing a covalently attached Cu molecular water oxidation catalyst, on graphitic surfaces generates powerful and robust molecular anodes. Turnover numbers higher than 11&#160;000 are achieved for the oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotentials of &#8776;250&#160;mV.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multistep synthesis of a new tetra-amidate macrocyclic ligand functionalized with alkyl-thiophene moieties, 15,15-bis(6-(thiophen-3-yl)hexyl)-8,13-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,h][1,4,7,10]tetraazacyclotridecine-6,7,14,16(15H,17H)-tetraone, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;, is reported. The reaction of the deprotonated ligand, &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cu(II) generates the complex [&lt;b&gt;LCu&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, that can be further oxidized to Cu(III) with iodine to generate [&lt;b&gt;LCu&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; ligand and their Cu complexes have been thoroughly characterized by analytic and spectroscopic techniques (including X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, XAS). Under oxidative conditions, the thiophene group of [&lt;b&gt;LCu&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex polymerizes on the surface of graphitic electrodes (glassy carbon disks (&lt;b&gt;GC&lt;/b&gt;), glassy carbon plates (&lt;b&gt;GC&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), carbon nanotubes (&lt;b&gt;CNT&lt;/b&gt;), or graphite felts (&lt;b&gt;GF&lt;/b&gt;)) generating highly stable thin films. With CNTs deposited on a GC by drop casting, hybrid molecular materials labeled as &lt;b&gt;GC/CNT@p-[LCu]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are obtained. The latter are characterized by electrochemical techniques that show their capacity to electrocatalytically oxidize water to dioxygen at neutral pH. These new molecular anodes achieve current densities in the range of 0.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.30&#160;V versus NHE with an onset overpotential at &#8776;250&#160;mV. Bulk electrolysis experiments show an excellent stability achieving TONs in the range of 7600 during 24&#160;h with no apparent loss of catalytic activity and maintaining the molecular catalyst integrity, as evidenced by electrochemical techniques and XAS spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Tunable Ambipolar Quantum Phase Transition in a Topological Excitonic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a 2D topological excitonic insulator, band inversion and spin orbit coupling give rise to quantum spin Hall (QSH) state, in which the insulating bulk state is formed/stabilized by the excitonic pairing among electrons and holes near the Fermi level. It presents direct evidence for excitonic pairing in a QSH system WTe2 through a gate&#8208;tunable ambipolar quantum phase transition.








Abstract
Coulomb interactions among electrons and holes in 2D semimetals with overlapping valence and conduction bands can give rise to a correlated insulating ground state via exciton formation and condensation. One candidate material in which such excitonic state uniquely combines with non&#8208;trivial band topology are atomic monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), in which a 2D topological excitonic insulator (2D TEI) forms. However, the detailed mechanism of the 2D bulk gap formation in WTe2, in particular with regard to the role of Coulomb interactions, has remained a subject of ongoing debate. Here, it shows that WTe2 is susceptible to a gate&#8208;tunable quantum phase transition, evident from an abrupt collapse of its 2D bulk energy gap upon ambipolar field&#8208;effect doping. Such gate tunability of a 2D TEI, into either n&#8208; and p&#8208;type semimetals, promises novel handles of control over non&#8208;trivial 2D superconductivity with excitonic&#160;pairing.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Design of Metastable Phase Catalyst Enables Highly&#8208;Performance Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell design of metastable phase nickel (Ni) catalyst achieves a beyond platinum&#8208;group metal performance with exhibiting approaching 100% conversion rate and selectivity, good stability, and a high TOF of 8241.8 h&#8722;1. The introduction of Ag core leads to electron transfer, and more oxidation states on the catalyst surface, which is conducive to H2 dissociation and phenylacetylene adsorption.








Abstract
Highly selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a highly important reaction for catalytic industry. Developing non&#8208;noble metal based catalysts with platinum group metal&#8208;like activity and selectivity is extremely crucial yet challenging. Metastable phase catalysts provide a potential candidate to realize high activity, yet the control of selectivity remains an open question. Here, this work first reports a metastable phase core&#8211;shell: face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase Ag (10 at%) core&#8208;metastable hexagonal closest packed (hcp) phase Ni (90 at%) shell catalyst, which represents high conversion rate, high selectivity, and remarkable universality for the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene and its derivatives. More impressively, a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 8241.8 h&#8722;1 is achieved, much higher than those of stable phase catalysts and reported platinum group metal based catalysts. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the surface of hcp Ni becomes more oxidized due to electron transfer from hcp Ni shell to fcc Ag core, which decreases the adsorption capacity of styrene on the metastable phase Ni surface, thus preventing full hydrogenation. This work has gained crucial research significance for the design of high performance metastable phase catalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Healable Extraocular&#8208;Muscle&#8208;Like Actuator Based on Dielectric Elastomer Actuator and Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>

         <dc:description>
A medical aid system combining with a self&#8208;powered extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator and a flexible capacitive sensor is constructed based on a self&#8208;healable dielectric elastomer actuator and a triboelectric nanogenerator, making it promising for using in disease control and prevention for patients suffering from permanent oculomotor nerve palsy through assisting eye movement and monitoring muscle movement.








Abstract
Although dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising artificial muscles for use as visual prostheses in patients with oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP), high driving voltage coupled with vulnerable compliant electrodes limits their safe long&#8208;term service. Herein, a self&#8208;healable polydimethylsiloxane compliant electrode based on reversible imine bonds and hydrogen bonds is prepared and coated on an acrylic ester film to develop a self&#8208;healable DEA (SDEA), followed by actuation with a high&#8208;output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to construct a self&#8208;powered DEA (TENG&#8208;SDEA). Under 135.9&#160;kV&#160;mm&#8722;1, the SDEA exhibits an elevated actuated strain of 50.6%, comparable to the actuation under DC power. Moreover, the mechanically damaged TENG&#8208;SDEA displays a self&#8208;healing efficiency of over 90% for 10 cycles. The TENG ensures the safe using of TENG&#8208;SDEAs and an extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator with oriented motion ability integrated by several TENG&#8208;SDEAs is constructed. Additionally, the SDEA is directly used as a flexible capacitive sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the patient's muscle movement. Accordingly, a medical aid system based on a conjunction of the extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator and a flexible capacitive sensor is manufactured to help the patients suffering from ONP with physical rehabilitation and treatment.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficient Perovskites Greatly Enhance the Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxide (LCMO64) experiences a calcium&#8208;leaching during electrochemical reaction processes, leading to the creation of abundant cation vacancies and enhanced electrochemical surface area, resulting in an elevated electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Many perovskite oxides (ABO3) are considered the most promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their high intrinsic activities. However, their electrocatalytic performance is often limited by poor electrical conductivity and low specific surface area. Here an electrochemically induced calcium&#8208;leaching process is reported to greatly increase the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 (LCMO64). The ECSA of the activated, Ca&#8208;deficient LCMO64 is &#8776;33.84% higher than that of the unactivated materials, demonstrating superior electrocatalytic ORR performance to the benchmark commercial Pt/C catalyst in an alkaline solution. Theoretical analysis coupled with electrochemical surface state probing and pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling suggests that this catalyst with the identified most favorable state under ORR operating conditions reaches the Sabatier optimum of alkaline ORR. This reconstructed LCMO64 is among the best&#8208;performing ORR catalysts ever reported, providing new insights into the design of advanced perovskite materials with optimal surface chemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>

Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, we report an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes. The newly designed OPD has been employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. In achieving this, we also develop a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;processing&#8208;property relationship in these OPDs. The BHJ thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF were characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, our newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>From Liquid to Solid Batteries: Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides as Emerging Cathodes with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRMO) cathode materials have attracted widespread attention due to their high specific capacity, energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as poor cycling stability, voltage decay and oxygen escape limit their commercial application in liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of safe and resilient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), driven by their remarkable safety features and superior energy density. ASSBs based on LRMO cathodes offer distinct advantages over conventional liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries, including long&#8208;term cycle stability, thermal and wider electrochemical windows stability, as well as the prevention of transition metal dissolution. This review aims to recapitulate the challenges and fundamental understandings associated with the application of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs. Additionally, it proposes the mechanisms of interfacial mechanical and chemical instability, introduces noteworthy strategies to enhance oxygen redox reversibility, enhancing high&#8208;voltage interfacial stability, and optimizing Li+ transfer kinetics. Furthermore, it suggests potential research approaches to facilitate the large&#8208;scale implementation of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Soft Sensor from Anisotropic Conductive Biphasic Liquid Metal&#8211;Polymer Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Subtle vibrations, such as sound and ambient noises, are common mechanical waves that can transmit energy and signals for modern technologies such as robotics and health management devices. However, soft electronics cannot accurately distinguish ultrasmall vibrations owing to their extremely small pressure, complex vibration waveforms, and high noise susceptibility. This study successfully recognized signals from subtle vibrations using a highly flexible anisotropic conductive gel (ACG) based on biphasic liquid metals. The relationships between the anisotropic structure, subtle vibrations, and electrical performance were investigated using rheological&#8211;electrical experiments. The refined anisotropic design successfully realized low&#8208;cost flexible electronics with ultrahigh sensitivity (Gauge Factor: 12787), extremely low detection limit (strain: 0.01%), and excellent frequency recognition accuracy (&gt; 99%), significantly surpassing those of current flexible sensors. The ultrasensitive flexible electronics in this study are beneficial for diverse advanced technologies such as acoustic engineering, wearable electronics, and intelligent robotics.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Crystal Twisted Bilayer Graphene on Liquid Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has generated significant attention in the fundamental research of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials due to its distinct twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent properties. Exploring the efficient production of TBG with a wide range of twist angles stands as one of the major frontiers in moir&#233; materials. Here, we reported the local space&#8208;confined chemical vapour deposition growth technique for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal TBG with twist angles ranging from 0 to 30&#176; on liquid copper substrates. The clean surface, pristine interface, high crystallinity, and thermal stability of TBG were verified by using comprehensive characterization techniques including optical microscopy, and electron microscopy, secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. The proportion of TBG in bilayer graphene reached as high as 89%. In addition, we investigated the stacking structure and growth mechanism of TBG, revealing that the second graphene layer developed beneath the first one. A series of comparative experiments illustrated that the liquid copper surface, with its excellent fluidity, promotes the growth of TBG. Electrical measurements showed the twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent electronic properties of as&#8208;grown TBG, achieving a room&#8208;temperature carrier mobility of 26640 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This work provides an approach for the in&#8208;situ preparation of 2D twisted materials and facilitates the application of TBG in the fields of electronics.

         <title>Linearly Manipulating Color Emission via Anion Exchange Technology for High Performance of Amplified Spontaneous Emission of Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most attractive advantages of all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are their optical gain over broad spectral ranges through the visible spectrum, and so are well suited to use in tunable lasers or broadband amplifiers. Most reported anion exchange reactions face a challenge to achieve the desired halogen&#8208;variable perovskites due to rapid and uncontrollable reaction and difficulty to synthesize directly. In this study, we demonstrate a simple vapor/solid anion exchange strategy for controlling the reaction process and realizing a wide range tuning of band gap and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) wavelength, which exhibits a temperature dependent anion exchange rate. By optimizing the reaction temperature at 90&#176;C, the ASE wavelength can be linearly manipulated by just controlling the reaction time. A clear quantitative relationship between ASE peak position and reaction time was achieved. Compared with the CsPbClBr2 film obtained via liquid phase anion exchange method, our fabricated perovskite films obtained by vapor/solid anion exchange technology exhibit superior film quality and enhanced ASE performance. This work may have applications in the future using facile and controllable techniques to develop high quality full&#8208;color visible lasers.

         <title>High&#8208;performance And Ecofriendly Organic Thermoelectrics Enabled by N&#8208;type Polythiophene Derivatives with Doping&#8208;induced Molecular Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability of n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials to tolerate high doping loading limits further development of n&#8208;type polymer conductivity. Herein, we report two alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type polythiophene derivatives that are n&#8208;PT3 and n&#8208;PT4. Due to the ability of two polymers to tolerate doping loading more significantly than 100 mol%, both achieve electrical conductivity &gt; 100 S cm&#8211;1. Moreover, the conductivity of both polythiophenes remains almost constant at high doping concentrations with excellent doping tunability, which may be related to their ability to overcome charging&#8208;induced backbone torsion and morphology change caused by saturated doping. The characterizations revealed that n&#8208;PT4 has a high doping level and carrier concentration (&gt; 3.10&#215;1020&#160;cm&#8211;3), and the carrier concentration continues to increase as the doping concentration increases. In addition, doping leads to improved crystal structure of n&#8208;PT4, and the crystallinity does not decrease significantly with increasing doping concentration; even the carrier mobility increases with it. The synergistic effect of these two leads to both n&#8208;PT3 and n&#8208;PT4 achieving a breakthrough of 100 in conductivity and power factor. The DMlmC&#8208;doped n&#8208;PT4 achieves a power factor of over 150 &#956;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2. These values are among the highest for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials.

These values are among the highest for n-type organic thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Soft Carbon&#8208;Thiourea With Fast Bulk Diffusion Kinetics For Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLMB) has long been impeded by low coulomb efficiency, short lifetime, poor rate performance and other problems caused by the rapid growth of lithium (Li) dendrites. Herein, a multiple&#8208;diffusion&#8208;channel N,S&#8208;doped soft carbon with expanded layer spacing was designed/developed by thiourea calcination for dendrite&#8208;free anodes. Since the enlarged layer spacing can improve Li+ transportation rate within the layers and N,S&#8208;doping can facilitate Li+ transport between the layers, the bulk phase diffusion (not just surface diffusion) kinetics can be improved, which in turn reduces the local current density, inhibits the growth of Li dendrites, and improves the rate performance. The resulting ASSLMB achieves record&#8208;high current density (15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), areal capacity (20 mAh cm&#8722;2), energy density (403&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (13,000 cycles). &gt;305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells were realized, representing one of the most critical breakthroughs for real&#8208;world application of ASSLMBs.

         <title>Hollow&#8208;structured and Polyhedron&#8208;Shaped High Entropy Oxide Towards Highly Active And Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction in A Full Ph Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High entropy metal oxides (HEO) are superior to many reactions involving multi&#8208;step elementary reactions. However, controlled synthesis of hollow&#8208;structured HEO catalysts, which offers large surface area and fast mass transfer kinetics, remains challenging and unexplored due to the complicated metal precursors. Herein, a metal organic framework&#8208;templated synthesis of hollow&#8208;structured and polyhedron&#8208;shaped HEO catalysts assembled with ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles, with up to ten metal elements, can be achieved, by taking advantage of the ion&#8208;exchange method. ZnFeNiCuCoRu&#8208;O HEO catalyst displays excellent activity and ultra&#8208;stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in full pH range, with an overpotential of 170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec&#8211;1, and a decay of activity by 7% in 30 h in alkaline medium, as well as a 12% and 8% decay in acidic and neutral medium, respectively. DFT calculation indicates that the energy barrier of the potential determining step on Ru&#8208;Fe bridge site is significantly lower than any other Ru&#8208;related bridge sites for the unique hollow structured HEO structures. This work highlights the importance of ion&#8208;exchange method in preparing highly stable and active hollow&#8208;structured HEOs catalysts towards highly efficient energy conversion and storage devices.

         <title>Origin of Phase Engineering CoTe2 Alloy Toward Kinetics&#8208;Reinforced and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Slow electrochemistry kinetics and dendrite growth are major obstacles for lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. The investigations over the polymorph effect requires more endeavors to further access the related catalyst design principles. Herein, we report the systematic evaluation of CoTe2 alloy with two polymorphs regarding sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and lithium plating/stripping. As disclosed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements, the orthorhombic (o&#8208;) and hexagonal (h&#8208;) CoTe2 make a substantial difference. We explore the reactivity origin of the CoTe2 polymorphs. The higher position of d&#8208;band centers for the Co atoms on the o&#8208;CoTe2 leads to a higher displacement of the antibonding state, the lower antibonding state occupancy, the more effective interaction with the sulfide moieties and lithium. Hence, o&#8208;CoTe2 annihilates h&#8208;CoTe2 and exhibits better catalysis and more uniform lithium deposition, consolidated by excellent performance of full cell made of o&#8208;CoTe2. It keeps stable charging/discharging for 800 cycles at 0.5 C with only 0.055% capacity decay per cycle and even achieves an areal capacity of 6.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading of 6.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the mechanistic perspective about the catalysts in Li&#8722;S batteries and provides new insight into the unified solution.

         <title>Robust Ru&#8208;VO2 Bifunctional Catalysts for All&#8208;Ph Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Designing robust bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) in all&#8208;pH conditions for overall water splitting (OWS) is an effective way to achieve sustainable development. Herein, we synthesize a composite Ru&#8208;VO2 containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles (NPs), and it shows a high OWS performance in full&#8208;pH range due to their synergist effect. In particular, the OER mass activities of Ru&#8208;VO2 at 1.53V (vs RHE) in acidic, alkaline and PBS solutions are approximately 65, 36 and 235 times of commercial RuO2 in the same conditions. The &#8220;Ru&#8208;VO2 || Ru&#8208;VO2&#8221; two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.515 V (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic water splitting, which can operate stably for 125 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without significant voltage decay. In situ Raman spectra and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry prove that the OER of Ru&#8208;VO2 in acid follows the adsorption evolution mechanism. DFT calculations further revealed the synergistic effect between Ru NP and Ru&#8208;doped VO2, which breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly enhances the OER activity. This work provides new insights into the design of novel bifunctional pH&#8208;universal catalysts for OWS.

         <title>In Situ 4d Printing of Polyelectrolyte/Magnetic Composites for Sutureless Gastric Perforation Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In situ bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for the sutureless tissue sealing of internal organs. However, most existing in situ bioprinting methods are limited by the complex and confined printing space inside the organs, harsh curing conditions for printable bioinks, and poor ability to suturelessly seal injured parts. 4D printing is a technique in which the shape, properties, or functionality of inks or products can be controllably varied over time under external stimuli. The combination of in&#8208;situ bioprinting and 4D printing is a promising technique for tissue repair. Herein, we report the in&#8208;situ 4D printing of polyelectrolyte/magnetic composites by gastroscopy for sutureless internal tissue sealing. Using gastric perforation as an example, a gelatin/sodium&#8208;alginate/magnetic (GSM) bioink was developed, which can be precisely located by a gastroscope with the assistance of an external magnetic field, solidified in gastric fluid, and firmly adhered to tissue surfaces. The solidified gelatin/sodium alginate/magnetic complexes (GSMCs) along the defect can be attracted by an external magnetic field, resulting in sutureless gastric perforation sealing. The working mechanism of the printed GSMC was explained by a numerical simulation method using the COMSOL software. A demonstration using a porcine stomach with an artificial perforation confirmed the feasibility of sutureless perforation using 4D printing. Moreover, an in vivo investigation on gastric perforation in a rat model identified the biocompatibility by H&amp;E and CD68+ staining. This study provides a new orientation and concept for functionality&#8208;modified in&#8208;situ 4D bioprinting.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects Toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess CO2 is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here we propose to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA/cm2 for over 120 hours. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 hours, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is around 19%.

However, improving both the yield of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here we propose to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro-driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu-C and In-H bonds.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Lens Particle Image Velocimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fluid flow behavior is visualized through particle image velocimetry (PIV) for understanding and studying experimental fluid dynamics. However, traditional PIV methods require multiple cameras and conventional lens systems for image acquisition to resolve multi&#8208;dimensional velocity fields. In turn, it introduces complexity to the entire system. Meta&#8208;lenses are advanced flat optical devices composed of artificial nanoantenna arrays. It can manipulate the wavefront of light with advantages of ultrathin, compact, and no spherical aberration. Meta&#8208;lenses offer novel functionalities and promise to replace traditional optical imaging systems. Here, we propose a binocular meta&#8208;lens PIV technique, where a pair of GaN meta&#8208;lenses are fabricated on one substrate and integrated with a CMOS sensor to form a compact binocular PIV system. The meta&#8208;lens weigh only 116&#160;mg, much lighter than commercial lenses. The three&#8208;dimensional velocity field can be obtained by the binocular disparity and particle image displacement information of fluid flow. The measurement error of vortex&#8208;ring diameter is about 1.25% experimentally validated via a Reynolds&#8208;number 2000 vortex&#8208;ring. This work demonstrates a new development trend for the PIV technique for rejuvenating traditional flow diagnostic tools towards a more compact, easy&#8208;to&#8208;deploy technique. It enables further miniaturization and low&#8208;power systems for portable, field&#8208;use, and space&#8208;constrained PIV applications.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny&#8221;, which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the negative capacitance in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, we focused on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II) and conducted a pioneering investigation on their negative capacitance responses. Our findings demonstrate that the negative capacitance exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Highly Potent and Low&#8208;Volume Concentration Additives for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Performance Rationalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The essential virtues of aqueous zinc battery chemistry stem from the energy&#8208;dense zinc metal anode and mild aqueous electrolytes. Yet, their incompatibility &#8211; as exposed by zinc's corrosion and associated dendrite problem &#8211; poses a challenge to achieving improved cycle life under practically relevant parameters. While electrolyte additives are a scalable strategy, additives that can function at low volume concentrations remain elusive. Here, through screening alkanol and alkanediol chemistries, 1,2&#8208;butanediol and pentanediol are unveiled as highly potent additives, which operate at a practical 1 volume% concentration owing to their ability to furnish dynamic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase through pronounced interfacial filming. This unique mechanistic action renders effective corrosion and dendrite mitigation, resulting in up to five to twenty&#8208;fold zinc cyclability enhancement with a high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.9%) and improved full&#8208;cell performance under demanding conditions, including at elevated temperatures. A machine learning&#8208;based analysis is presented to rationalize the additive performance relative to critical physicochemical descriptors, which can pave the way for a rational approach to efficient additive discoveries.

         <title>DNA Nanomaterial&#8208;Empowered Surface Engineering of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell&#8208;secreted biological nanoparticles that are critical mediators of intercellular communication. They contain diverse bioactive components, which are promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Their nanosized membrane&#8208;bound structures and innate ability to transport functional cargo across major biological barriers make them promising candidates as drug delivery vehicles. However, the complex biology and heterogeneity of EVs pose significant challenges for their controlled and actionable applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Recently, DNA molecules with high biocompatibility have emerged as excellent functional blocks for surface engineering of EVs. The robust Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing of DNA molecules and the resulting programmable DNA nanomaterials provide the EV surface with precise structural customization and adjustable physical and chemical properties, creating unprecedented opportunities for EV biomedical applications. This review focuses on the recent advances in the utilization of programmable DNA to engineer EV surfaces. We summarize the biology, function, and biomedical applications of EVs and introduce the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in EV isolation, analysis, and delivery based on DNA nanomaterials. Finally, we discuss the challenges and new frontiers in EV engineering.

         <title>Multicrystalline Informatics Applied to Multicrystalline Silicon for Unraveling The Microscopic Root Cause of Dislocation Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of optical and photoluminescence images obtained from practical multicrystalline silicon wafers, utilizing various machine learning models for dislocation cluster region extraction, grain segmentation, and crystal orientation prediction. As a result, we were able to build a realistic three&#8208;dimensional (3D) model that includes the generation point of dislocation clusters. Finite element stress analysis on the 3D model coupled with crystal growth simulation revealed inhomogeneous and complex stress distribution and that dislocation clusters are frequently formed along the slip plane with the highest shear stress among twelve equivalents, concentrated along bending grain boundaries (GBs). Multiscale analysis of the extracted GBs near the generation point of dislocation clusters combined with ab initio calculations has shown that the dislocation generation due to the concentration of shear stress is caused by the nanofacet formation associated with GB bending. This mechanism cannot be captured by the Haasen&#8208;Alexander&#8208;Sumino (HAS) model. Thus, our research method revealed the existence of a dislocation generation mechanism unique to the multicrystalline structure. Multicrystalline informatics linking experimental, theoretical, computational, and data science on multicrystalline materials at multiple scales is expected to contribute to the advancement of materials science by unraveling complex phenomena in various multicrystalline materials.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are highly ordered structures exhibiting sub&#8208;nanometer porosity, possess significant potential for diverse gas applications. However, their inherent insulative properties limit their utility in electrochemical gas sensing. This investigation successfully modified the electrical conductivity of zeolitic imidazolte framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) employing a straightforward surface oxidation methodology. A ZIF&#8208;8 polycrystalline layer was applied on a wafer&#8208;scale oxide substrate and subjected to thermal annealing at 300&#176;C under ambient air conditions, resulting in nanoscale oxide layers while preserving the fundamental properties of the ZIF&#8208;8. Subsequent exposure to NO2 instigated the evolution of an electrically interconnected structure with the formation of electron&#8208;rich dopants derived from the decomposition of nitrogen&#8208;rich organic linkers. The N&#8208;carbon&#8208;hybridized ZnO/ZIF&#8208;8 device demonstrated remarkable sensitivity (&#8776; 130 ppm&#8722;1) and extreme selectivity in NO2 gas detection with a lower detection limit of 0.63 ppb under 150&#176;C operating temperature, surpassing the performance of existing sensing materials. The exceptional performances result from the Debye length scale dimensionality of ZnO and the high affinity of ZIF&#8208;8 to NO2. Our methodology for manipulating MOF conductivity through surface oxidation holds the potential to accelerate the development of MOF&#8208;hybridized conductive channels for a variety of electrical applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphors Based on CuInSe2 Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for Micro&#8208;LEDs Applications</title>

Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent nanomaterials are urgently required for portable mini or micro phosphors&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). However, most existing NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors are generally restricted by their low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) or large particle size. Herein, we develop a kind of highly efficient NIR nanophosphors based on copper indium selenide quantum dots (CISe QDs). The PL peak of these QDs can be exquisitely manipulated from 750 to 1150&#160;nm by altering the stoichiometry of Cu/In and doping with Zn2+. Their absolute PLQY can be significantly improved from 28.6% to 92.8% via coating a thin ZnSe shell. By combining the phosphors with a commercial blue chip, we fabricated an NIR pc&#8208;LED with remarkable photostability and a record&#8208;high radiant flux of 88.7 mW@350&#160;mA among the Pb/Cd&#8208;free QDs&#8208;based NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. Particularly, such QDs&#8208;based nanophosphors acted as excellent luminescence converter for NIR micro&#8208;LEDs with microarray diameters below 5&#160;&#956;m, which significantly exceeds the resolutions of current commercial inkjet display pixels. Our findings may open new avenues for the exploration of highly efficient NIR micro&#8208;LEDs in a variety of applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Growth and Metastable Phase Transition in Metallic Solid Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Laser processing in metals is versatile yet limited by its reliance in phase transformation through heating rather than electronic excitation due to their low absorptivity attributing from their highly ordered structures. Metastable states (i.e., surfaces, glasses, undercooled liquids), however, represent a unique platform, both energetically and structurally to enable energy landscape tuning through selective stimuli. Herein, we demonstrate this ansatz by exploiting thin passivating oxides to stabilize an undercooled state, followed by photo&#8208;perturbation of the near surface order to induce convective Marangoni flows, edge&#8208;coalescence and phase transition into a grown metastable solid bearing asymmetric composition between the near surface and core of the formed structure. The self&#8208;eliminating nature of the process creates a perfectly contained system which can maintain high relaxation energy barrier and deep metastable state for extended period of time.

         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin Within 2d Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, we have realized the aspirin synthesis by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8764;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23&#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. Confined in 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with complete conversion.

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Chemiluminescence Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;induced Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has a high prevalence but is poorly managed for cancer patients due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques. Molecular optical imaging can provide a noninvasive way for real&#8208;time monitoring of CIPN. However, this has not been reported, likely due to the absence of optical probes capable of imaging deep into the spinal canal and possessing sufficient sensitivity for minimal dosage through local injection into the dorsal root ganglia. Herein, we synthesize a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophore (MPBD) with a chemiluminescence quantum yield higher than other reported probes and develop it into a NIR activatable chemiluminescent probe (CalCL) for in vivo imaging of CIPN. CalCL is constructed by caging MPBD with calpain&#8208;cleavable peptide moiety while conjugating polyethylene glycol chain to endow water solubility. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue penetration of chemiluminescence and specific turn&#8208;on response of CalCL towards calpain (a hallmark of CIPN), it allows for sensitive detection of paclitaxel&#8208;mediated CIPN in living mice, which is unattainable by fluorescence imaging. This study thus not only develops a highly efficient chemiluminescent probe but also presents the first optical imaging approach toward high&#8208;throughput screening of neurotoxic drugs.

         <title>Heterojunction Engineering of Multinary Metal Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) via water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective path to solve the current energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterojunction photocatalysts, containing two or more semiconductors, exhibit better PHE rates than those with only one semiconductor owing to the altered band alignment at the interface and stronger driving force for charge separation. Traditional binary metal sulfide (BMS)&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, such as CdS, MoS2, and PbS, demonstrate excellent PHE performance. However, the recently developed multinary metal sulfide (MMS)&#8208;based photocatalysts possess favorable chemical stability, tunable band structure, and flexible element compositions, and have considerable potential to realize higher PHE rates than those of BMSs. In this review article, we first elucidate the mechanism of PHE and then systematically summarize various single and heterojunction MMS&#8208;based photocatalysts and their charge transfer behaviors and PHE performances. We conclude by offering a perspective on potential future research directions in this field.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Bioaffinity Assays:From the research laboratory to the market</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advances in the development of new biorecognition elements, nanoparticle&#8208;based labels as well as instrumentation have inspired the design of new bioaffinity assays. This review critically discusses the potential of nanoparticles to replace current enzymatic or molecular labels in immunoassays and other bioaffinity assays. We highlight successful implementations of nanoparticles in commercial assays and the need for rapid tests incorporating nanoparticles in different roles such as capture support, signal generation elements and signal amplification systems. The limited number of nanoparticles applied in current commercial assays can be explained by challenges associated with the analysis of real samples (e.g., blood, urine, or nasal swabs) that have been difficult to resolve, particularly if the same performance can be achieved more easily by conventional labels. Lateral flow assays that are based on the visual detection of the red&#8208;colored line formed by colloidal gold are a notable exception, exemplified by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 rapid antigen tests that have moved from initial laboratory testing to widespread market adaption in less than two years.

         <title>Transparent Self&#8208;Healing Anti&#8208;freezing Ionogel for Monolayered Triboelectric Nanogenerator And Electromagnetic Energy&#8208;Based Touch Panel</title>

Abstract
The advent of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence era necessitates the advancement of self&#8208;powered electronics. However, prevalent multifunctional electronics still face great challenges in rigid electrodes, stacked layers, and external power sources to restrict the development in flexible electronics. Here, we introduce a transparent, self&#8208;healing, anti&#8208;freezing (TSA) ionogel composed of fluorine&#8208;rich ionic liquid and fluorocarbon elastomer, which is engineered for monolayered triboelectric nanogenerators (M&#8208;TENG) and electromagnetic energy&#8208;based touch panels. Notably, the TSA&#8208;ionogel exhibits remarkable features including outstanding transparency (90%), anti&#8208;freezing robustness (253 K), impressive stretchability (600%), and repetitive self&#8208;healing capacity. The resultant M&#8208;TENG achieves a significant output power density (200&#160;mW/m2) and sustains operational stability beyond one year. Leveraging this remarkable performance, the M&#8208;TENG is adeptly harnessed for biomechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered control interface, electroluminescent devices and enabling wireless control over electrical appliances. Furthermore, harnessing Faraday's induction law and exploiting human body's intrinsic antenna properties, the TSA&#8208;ionogel seamlessly transforms into an autonomous multifunctional epidermal touch panel. This touch panel offers impeccable input capabilities through word inscription and participation in the Chinese game of Go. Consequently, the TSA&#8208;ionogel's innovation holds the potential to reshape the trajectory of next&#8208;generation electronics and profoundly revolutionize the paradigm of human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Electron&#8208;induced Degradation in Blue Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The poor stability of blue quantum&#8208;dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (B&#8208;QLEDs) hinders their application in displays. To improve the stability of B&#8208;QLEDs, the degradation mechanism should be revealed. Here, we investigate the degradation mechanism of B&#8208;QLEDs by monitoring the changes occurring in the QDs and the hole transport layers (HTL) during device operation, respectively. We reveal that the accumulation of electrons within the QDs is responsible for the degradation of the devices. On the one hand, the accumulated electrons induce the detachment of oleic acid ligands, leading to permanent damage to the stability of B&#8208;QDs. On the other hand, the accumulated electrons leak into the HTL or recombine at the HTL/QDs interface, leading to the degradation of HTL. The formation of surface defects in B&#8208;QDs and the decomposition of HTL contribute to the degradation of B&#8208;QLEDs. Our results reveal the strong dependence of B&#8208;QLEDs stability on the accumulated electrons, the QDs and the HTL, which could help researchers to develop effective design strategies for improving the lifespan of B&#8208;QLEDs.

         <title>Functional&#8208;group&#8208;induced Single Quantum Well Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2d Perovskite for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, randomly distributed multiple quantum wells (QW) two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are frequently generated, which are detrimental to carrier transport and structural stability. Here, the high quality 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is constructed by fabricating functional&#8208;group&#8208;induced single QW Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskites. The utilization of &#8208;OCH3 in the precursor solution facilitates the formation of colloidal particles with uniform size, resulting in the production of a pure 2D DJ perovskite with an n value of 3. This strategy facilitates the improvement of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural stability and expedites carrier transport. The resultant devices accomplish a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.26% (certified 25.04%) and 23.56% at a larger area (1 cm2) with negligible hysteresis. The devices maintain &gt;96% and &gt;89% of their initial efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination for 1300&#160;h and under damp&#8208;heat conditions (85&#176;C and 85% RH) for 1010&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Liquid Metal Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Storage systems are vital components of electronic devices, while significant challenges persist in achieving flexible memory due to limitations of existing storage methodologies. Inspired by the polarization and depolarization mechanisms in the human brain, here we propose a novel class of storage principles and achieve a fully flexible memory through introducing the oxidation and deoxidation behaviors of liquid metals. Specifically, reversible electrochemical oxidation is utilized to modulate the overall conductivity of the target liquid metals, creating a substantial 11&#8208;order resistance difference for binary data storage. To obtain the best storage performance, systematic optimizations of multiple parameters are conducted. Conceptual experiments demonstrate the memory's stability under extreme deformations (100% stretching, 180&#176; bending, 360&#176; twisting). Further tests reveal that the memory performs better when its unit size gets smaller, warranting superior integrability. Finally, a complete storage system achieves remarkable performance metrics, including rapid storage speed (&gt;33 Hz), long data retention capacity (&gt;43200 s), and stable repeatable operation (&gt;3500 cycles). This groundbreaking method not only overcomes the inherent rigidity limitations of existing electronic storage units but also opens new possibilities for innovating neuromorphic devices, offering fundamental and practical avenues for future applications in soft robotics, wearable electronics, and bio&#8208;inspired artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Nanodiamond&#8208;enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanodiamonds hold great potential for diverse applications due to their biocompatibility, non&#8208;toxicity and versatile functionalization. Direct visualization of nanodiamonds by means of non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques would open new venues for labeling and tracking, offering unprecedented and unambiguous detection of labeled cells or nanodiamond&#8208;based drug carrier systems. The structural defects in diamonds, such as vacancies, can have paramagnetic properties and potentially act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report the smallest nanoscale diamond particles, detonation nanodiamonds, to effectively reduce longitudinal relaxation time T1 and provide signal enhancement in MRI. Using in vivo, chicken embryos, we demonstrate direct visualization of nanodiamonds as bright signal with high contrast to noise ratio. At 24 hours following intravascular application marked signal enhancement is noticed in the liver and the kidneys, suggesting uptake by the phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and in vivo labeling of these cells. This is confirmed by visualization of nanodiamond&#8208;labeled macrophages as positive (bright) signal, in vitro. Macrophage cell labeling is not associated with significant increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines or marked cytotoxicity. These results indicate nanodiamonds as a novel gadolinium&#8208;free contrast enhancing agent with potential for cell labeling and tracking and over periods of time.

         <title>Neutrophil Function Conversion Driven by Immune Switchpoint Regulator Against Diabetes&#8208;Related Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reinforced biofilm structures and dysfunctional neutrophils induced by excessive oxidative stress contribute to the refractoriness of diabetes&#8208;related biofilm infections (DRBIs). Herein, in contrast to traditional antibacterial therapies, an immune switchpoint&#8208;driven neutrophil immune function conversion (NIFC) strategy based on a deoxyribonuclease I loaded vanadium carbide MXene (DNase&#8208;I@V2C) nano&#8208;regulator was proposed to treat DRBIs via biofilm lysis and redirecting neutrophil functions from NETosis to phagocytosis in diabetes. Owing to its intrinsic SOD/CAT&#8208;like activities, DNase&#8208;I@V2C effectively scavenged ROS in a high oxidative stress microenvironment to maintain the biological activity of DNase&#8208;I. By increasing the depth of biofilm penetration of DNase&#8208;I, DNase&#8208;I@V2C thoroughly degraded extracellular DNA (eDNA) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), thus breaking the physical barrier of biofilms. More importantly, as an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase&#8208;I@V2C can skew neutrophil functions from NETosis towards phagocytosis by intercepting ROS&#8208;NE/MPO&#8208;PAD4 and activating ROS&#8208;PI3K&#8208;AKT&#8208;mTOR pathways in diabetic microenvironment, thereby eliminating biofilm infections. Biofilm lysis and synergistic neutrophil function conversion exerted favorable therapeutic effects on biofilm infections in vitro and in vivo. This study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of effectively achieving DRBIs with high therapeutic efficacy by regulating immune switchpoint to reverse neutrophil functions.

         <title>Terahertz Liquid Biosensor Based on A Graphene Metasurface for Ultrasensitive Detection with A Quasi&#8208;Bound State in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The concept of a quasi&#8208;bound state in a continuum (QBIC) has garnered significant attention in various fields such as sensing, communication, and optical switching. Within metasurfaces, QBICs offer a reliable platform that enables sensing capabilities through potent interactions between local electric fields and matter. Herein, we report a novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of QBIC with graphene, which enables multidimensional detection. The proposed biosensor is distinctive because of its ability to discern concentrations of ethanol and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone in a wide range from 100% to 0%, by monitoring the changes in the resonance intensity and maximum wavelet coefficient. This approach demonstrates an excellent linear fit, which ensures robust quantitative analysis. The remarkable sensitivity of our biosensor enables it to detect minute changes in low&#8208;concentration solutions, with the lowest detection concentration value (LDCV) of 0.21 pg/mL. We effectively constructed two&#8208;dimensional wavelet coefficient intensity cards through continuous wavelet transforms, which presents a more accurate approach for determining the concentration of the solution. Ultimately, our novel sensing platform offers a host of advantages, including heightened sensitivity and reusability. This pioneering approach establishes a new avenue for liquid&#8208;based terahertz biosensing.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;based Optical Logic Operators Driven by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this paper, a novel optical logic operator based on the multifunctional metasurface driven by all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network is reported, which can perform four principal quantum logic operations (Pauli&#8208;X, Pauli&#8208;Y, Pauli&#8208;Z and Hadamard gates). The two ground states |0&#12297; and |1&#12297;&#8197;are characterized by two orthogonal linear polarization states. The proposed spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network only contains a hidden layer physically mapped as a metasurface with simple and compact unit cells, which dramatically reduces the volume and computing resources required for the system. The designed optical quantum operator has been proven to achieve high fidelities for all four quantum logical gates, up to 99.96% numerically and 99.88% experimentally. Our solution would facilitate the construction of large&#8208;scale optical quantum computing systems and scalable optical quantum devices.

         <title>An Anti&#8208;Dehydration Hydrogel Based on Zwitterionic Oligomers for Bioelectronic Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal interfacing materials for on&#8208;skin healthcare devices, yet their susceptibility to dehydration hinders their practical use. While incorporating hygroscopic metal salts can prevent dehydration and maintain ionic conductivity, concerns arise regarding metal toxicity due to the passage of small ions through the skin barrier. Herein, we report an anti&#8208;dehydration hydrogel enabled by the incorporation of zwitterionic oligomers into its network. This hydrogel exhibits exceptional water retention properties, maintaining approximately 88% of its weight at 40% relative humidity, 25&#176;C for 50 days and about 84% after being heated at 50&#176;C for 3 hours. Crucially, the molecular weight design of the embedded oligomers prevents their penetration into the epidermis, as evidenced by experimental and molecular simulation results. Our hydrogel allows stable signal acquisition in electrophysiological monitoring of humans and plants under low&#8208;humidity conditions. This research provides a promising strategy for the development of epidermis&#8208;safe and biocompatible anti&#8208;dehydration hydrogel interfaces for on&#8208;skin devices.

         <title>Marriage of A Dual&#8208;Plasmonic Interface and Optical Microfiber for Nir&#8208;Ii Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The use of light as a powerful tool for disease treatment has introduced a new era in tumor treatment and provided abundant opportunities for light&#8208;based tumor theranostics. This work reports a photothermal theranostic fiber integrating cancer detection and therapeutic functions. Its self&#8208;heating effect can be tuned at ultralow powers and used for self&#8208;heating detection and tumor ablation. The fiber, consisting of a dual&#8208;plasmonic nanointerface and an optical microfiber, can be used to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, quantify cancer cells, perform hyperthermal ablation of cancer cells, and evaluate the ablation efficacy. Its cancer cell ablation rate reached 89% in a single treatment. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed quick, deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia in the NIR&#8208;II window, which could markedly ablate tumors. The marriage of a dual&#8208;plasmonic nanointerface and an optical microfiber presents a novel paradigm in photothermal therapy, offering the potential to surmount the challenges posed by limited light penetration depth, nonspecific accumulation in normal tissues, and inadvertent damage in current methods. This work thus provides insight for the exploration of an integrated theranostic platform with simultaneous functions in cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, and postoperative monitoring for future practical applications.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Guided Crystallization of Xanthine Derivatives for Optical Metamaterial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Numerous bio&#8208;organisms employ template&#8208;assisted crystallization of molecular solids to yield crystal morphologies with unique optical properties that are difficult to reproduce synthetically. Here, we present a facile procedure to deposit bio&#8208;inspired birefringent crystals of xanthine derivatives on a template of single&#8208;crystal quartz. We obtain crystalline sheets that are several millimeters in length, several hundred micrometers in width, and 300 to 600&#160;nm thick. The crystal sheets are characterized with a well&#8208;defined orientation both in and out of the substrate plane, giving rise to high optical anisotropy in the plane parallel to the quartz surface, with a refractive index difference &#916;n&#8776;0.25 and a refractive index along the slow axis of n&#8776;1.7. We further show that patterning of the crystalline stripes with a tailored periodic grating leads to a thin organic polarization&#8208;dependent diffractive meta&#8208;surface, opening the door to the fabrication of various optical devices from a platform of small&#8208;molecule based organic dielectric crystals.

         <title>Programmable Dynamic Information Storage Composite Film with Highly Sensitive Thermochromism and Gradually Adjustable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of an integrated material system capable of effectively organizing and combining multisource information, such as dynamic pigmentary, structural and fluorescent colors, is significant and challenging. Achieving such programmable dynamic information storage could considerably enhance the diversity and security of information deliveries. Here, we present a polymer&#8208;stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (PSCLC) system with highly temperature&#8208;sensitive structural color and light&#8208;sensitive pigmentary and fluorescence colors. The prepared CLCs can reversibly change its structural color from red to blue within variational 3&#176;C near room temperature, and exhibit a gradually adjustable fluorescence which can transform from blue to pink and finally to bright red. All this dynamic information is programmable and tailored, hundreds of thousands of (&gt;540,000) pattern combinations can easily achieve by optical writing with a &#8220;bagua&#8221; pattern photomask. Therefore, if the corresponding code combinations to the pattern are assigned particular meanings, encrypted transmission of information with very high security can be achieved by utilizing applicable information encoding tables and decryption rules.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as spin&#8208;orbit coupling layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, we report the experimental observation of spin&#8208;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2. The spin&#8208;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c axis of the crystal. Our results provide a direct pathway toward applicable two&#8208;dimensional spintronic devices.

         <title>Au Nanocluster Assisted Microstructural Reconstruction for Buried Interface Healing for Enhanced Perovskite Solar Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneity of perovskite film crystallization along the vertical direction leads to voids and traps at the buried interfaces, hampering both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, bovine serum albumin&#8208;functionalized Au nanoclusters (ABSA), combined with heavy gravity, high surface charge density and strong interactions with the electron transport layer, are designed to reconstruct the buried interfaces for not only high&#8208;quality crystallization, but also improved carrier transfer. The ABSA macromolecules with amine function groups and larger surface charge density interact with the perovskite to improve the crystallinity, and gradually migrate towards the buried interface, healing the defective voids, hence suppressing surface recombination velocity from 3075 to 452 cm&#183;s&#8722;1. The healed buried interface and the higher surface potential of ABSA&#8208;modified TiO2 lead to improved carrier extraction at the interface. The resulting solar cell attains a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% with negligible hysteresis and remarkable stability, maintaining 92.9% of their initial efficiency after 3200 hours of exposure to the ambient atmosphere, they also exhibit better continuous irradiation stability compared to control devices. Our findings provide a new metal&#8208;protein complex to eliminate the deleterious voids and defects at the buried interface for improved photovoltaic performance and stability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Graphene Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy for Instability of Intermediate Amyloid Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule techniques are powerful microscopy methods that provide new insights into biological processes. Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM) is an ideal single&#8208;molecule technique for overcoming the poor spatiotemporal resolution of optical approaches. However, single&#8208;molecule LP&#8208;TEM is limited by several challenges such as electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced molecular damage, difficulty in identifying biomolecular species, and a lack of analytical approaches for conformational dynamics. Herein, we present a single&#8208;molecule graphene liquid&#8208;cell TEM (GLC&#8208;TEM) technique that enables the investigation of real&#8208;time structural perturbations of intact amyloid fibrils. We demonstrate that graphene membranes significantly extend the observation period of native amyloid beta proteins without causing oxidative damage owing to electron beams, which is necessary for imaging. Stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single fibrils reveal that structural perturbations in the early fibrillar stage are responsible for the formation of various amyloid polymorphs. The advantage of observing structural behavior in real time with unprecedented resolution will potentially make GLC&#8208;TEM a complementary approach to other single&#8208;molecule techniques.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Flexible Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are attracting increasing attention due to their potential applications in flat panel lighting and displays. The solution process, large&#8208;area fabrication, and flexibility are attractive properties of PeLEDs over traditional inorganic LEDs. However, it is still very challenging to deposit uniform perovskite films on flexible substrates using blade or slot&#8208;die coating, as the flexible substrate is not perfectly flat. Here, we adopt the inkjet printing technique and overcome the key challenges step&#8208;by&#8208;step in preparing large&#8208;area films on flexible substrates. We first use double hole transporting layers and a wetting interfacial layer to improve the surface wettability so that the printed perovskite droplets can form a continuous wet film. We then manipulate the fluidic and evaporation dynamics of the perovskite wet layer to suppress the coffee ring effect by solvent engineering. We finally obtained uniform perovskite films on flexible substrates with different perovskite compositions. The peak EQE of the inkjet&#8208;printed PeLEDs reaches 14.3%. Large&#8208;area flexible PeLEDs (4&#215;7 cm2) also show very uniform emission. Our work represents a significant step toward real applications of large&#8208;area PeLEDs in flexible flat panel lighting.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Organic Photodiodes Realized by Polaron Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A novel approach for developing shortwave infrared (SWIR) organic photodiodes (OPDs) using doped polymers is presented. SWIR OPDs are challenging to produce because of the limitations in extending the absorption of conjugated molecules and the high dark currents of SWIR&#8208;absorbing materials. Herein, we show that the conversion of bound polarons to free polarons by light energy can be utilized as a SWIR photodetection mechanism. To maximize the bound&#8208;polaron density and bound&#8208;to&#8208;free polaron ratio of the doped polymer film, we engineered the doping process and diffused dopant molecules into the crystalline domain of the polymer matrix and confirm a direct correlation between the bound&#8208;to&#8208;free polaron ratio and device performance. The optimized double&#8208;doped SWIR OPD exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 77100% and specific detectivity of 1.11 &#215; 1011 Jones against SWIR. These findings demonstrate the application potential of polarons as alternatives for Frenkel excitons in SWIR OPDs.

Abstract
Sound plays a crucial role in our perception of the world. It allows us to communicate, learn, detect potential dangers, diagnose diseases, and much more. However, traditional acoustic sensors are limited in their form factors, being rigid and cumbersome, which restricts their potential applications. Recently, acoustic sensors have made significant advancements, transitioning from rudimentary forms to wearable devices and smart everyday clothing that can conform to soft, curved, and deformable surfaces or surroundings. In this review, we comprehensively explore the latest scientific and technological breakthroughs with insightful analysis in materials, physics, design principles, fabrication strategies, functions, and applications of flexible and wearable acoustic sensing technology. We highlight the new generation of acoustic sensors that can recognize voice, interact with machines, control robots, enable marine positioning and localization, monitor structural health, diagnose human vital signs in deep tissues, and perform organ imaging. These innovations offer unique solutions to significant challenges in fields such as healthcare, biomedicine, wearables, robotics, and metaverse. Finally, we address the existing challenges and future opportunities in the field, providing strategies to advance acoustic sensing technologies for intriguing real&#8208;world applications and inspire new research directions.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Hierarchical Micro&#8208;barcodes With Expanded Storage Capacity for Optical Multiplex and Information Encryptionik</title>

Abstract
The design of nanosegregated fluorescent tags/barcodes by geometrical patterning with precise dimensions and hierarchies could integrate multi&#8208;level optical information within one carrier and enhance micro&#8208;sized barcoding techniques for ultrahigh&#8208;density optical data storage and encryption. However, precise control of the spatial distribution in micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;sized matrices intrinsically limits the accessible barcoding applications in terms of material design and construction. In this study, crystallization forces are leveraged to enable a rapid, programmable molecular packing and rapid epitaxial growth of fluorescent units in 2D via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). We systematically explore the fluorescence encoding density, scalability, information storage capacity, and decoding techniques of the robust 2D polymeric barcoding platform. These results provide a theoretical and an experimental foundation for expanding the fluorescence storage capacity, which is a longstanding challenge in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro&#8208;barcoding techniques and establish a generalized and adaptable coding platform for high&#8208;throughput analysis and optical multiplexing.

Abstract
Enhancing electrocatalytic performance through structural and compositional engineering has attracted considerable attention. However, most materials only function as pre&#8208;catalysts, and convert into &#8220;real catalysts&#8221; during electrochemical reactions. Such transition involves dramatic structural and compositional changes and disrupts their designed properties. Herein, we developed for the first time a laser&#8208;ironing (LI) approach capable of in&#8208;situ forming a laser&#8208;ironing capping layer (LICL) on the Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L flakes. During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, the LICL sustains the leaf&#8208;like morphology and promotes the formation of OER&#8208;active Co3O4 nanoclusters with the highest activity and stability. In contrast, the pristine and conventional heat&#8208;treated Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L both collapse and transform to less active CoOOH. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations pinpoint the importance of the high spin (HS) states of Co ions and the narrowed band gap in Co3O4 nanoclusters. They enhance the OER activity by promoting spin&#8208;selected electron transport, effectively lowering the energy barrier, and realizing a spontaneous O2&#8208;releasing step that is the potential determining step in CoOOH. This study presents an innovative approach for modulating both structural and compositional evolutions of electrocatalysts during the reaction, sustaining stability with high performance during dynamic electrochemical reactions, and providing new pathways for facile and high&#8208;precision surface microstructure control.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;mediated Delivery of Anti&#8208;PU.1 Sirna via Localized Intracisternal Administration Reduces Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Microglia, the brain's immune cells, express many of the AD&#8208;risk loci identified in genome wide association studies and present a promising target for anti&#8208;inflammatory RNA therapeutics but are difficult to transfect with current methods. Here, we examined several lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations and identified a lead candidate that supports efficient RNA delivery in cultures of human stem cell&#8208;derived microglia&#8208;like cells (iMGLs) and animal models of neuroinflammation. The lead microglia LNP (MG&#8208;LNP) formulation showed minimal toxicity and improved delivery efficiency to inflammatory iMGLs, suggesting a preference for delivery into activated microglia. Systemic injection of the MG&#8208;LNP formulation generated wide&#8208;spread expression of the delivered reporter construct in all organs whereas local intracisternal injection directly into the cerebrospinal fluid led to preferential expression in the brain. We showed that LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of siRNA targeting the PU.1 transcription factor, a known AD&#8208;risk locus, successfully reduced PU.1 levels in iMGLs and reduced neuroinflammation in mice injected with LPS and in CK&#8208;p25 mice that mimic the chronic neuroinflammation seen in AD patients. Our LNP formulation represents an effective RNA delivery vehicle when applied intrathecally and can be broadly utilized to test potential neuroinflammation&#8208;directed gene therapies.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
((Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving our understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspectives; we encourage the scientific community to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.))

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the potential of the S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic system in driving photocatalytic hydrogen generation, conventional approaches tend to focus too heavily on a single reduction site. These systems still suffer poor redox ability and charge separation impairing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel strategy of designing a double S&#8208;scheme system that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. In this work, we put forth a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic carbon nitride. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as 40.2% at the wavelength of 365&#160;nm. This enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is ascribed to the efficient separation and transportation induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Supporting this, both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ) affirm the efficient charge transportation across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. Our findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

Our findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S-scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Enabled by Inhibited Escape of Volatile Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The intrinsically weak bonding structure in halide perovskite materials makes components in the thin films volatile, leading to decomposition of halide perovskite materials. The reactions within the perovskite film are reversible provided that components do not escape the thin films. Here, we report a holistic approach to improve the efficiency and stability of PSMs by preventing the effusion of volatile components. Specifically, we have developed a method for in&#8208;situ generation of channel barrier layers for perovskite photovoltaic modules. The resulting PSMs attain a certified aperture PCE of 21.37%, and possess remarkable continuous operation stability for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of T90 &gt; 1100 h in ambient air, and damp heat (DH) tracking of T93 &gt; 1400 h.

Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, we report a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using Polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides towards cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, we can tailor it into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Heat Circulation Meta&#8208;Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature&#8208;dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works were compelled to treat dynamic and steady&#8208;state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, we report the creation of a convection&#8208;based thermal meta&#8208;device which supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat circulation. We observe the non&#8208;trivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters, and reveal the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi&#8208;symmetric scattering matrix of our three&#8208;port meta&#8208;device, and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. Our findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady&#8208;state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat&#8208;transfer&#8208;related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.

         <title>Super&#8208;structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, And Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous PVA hydrogel as dissipative layer and in&#8208;situ photocuring technology for entangling PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, our hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of tough PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties simultaneously, our PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

         <title>A multifunctional scaffold for bone infection treatment by delivery of microRNA therapeutics combined with antimicrobial nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Treating bone infections and ensuring bone repair is one of the greatest global challenges of modern orthopaedics, made complex by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks due to long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment and debilitating large bone defects following infected tissue removal. An ideal multi&#8208;faceted solution would eradicate bacterial infection without long&#8208;term antibiotic use while simultaneously stimulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Here, we developed a multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold that addresses these needs by leveraging the potential of antibiotic&#8208;free antimicrobial nanoparticles (copper&#8208;doped bioactive glass, CuBG) to combat infection without contributing to AMR in conjunction with microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy (utilising an inhibitor of microRNA&#8208;138) to stimulate both osteogenesis and angiogenesis. CuBG scaffolds reduced the attachment of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by over 80%, showcasing antimicrobial functionality. The antagomiR&#8208;138 nanoparticles induced osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and healed a large load&#8208;bearing defect in a rat femur when delivered on the scaffold. Combining both promising technologies resulted in a multifunctional antagomiR&#8208;138&#8208;activated CuBG scaffold inducing hMSC&#8208;mediated osteogenesis and stimulating vasculogenesis in an in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Overall, this multifunctional scaffold catalyses killing mechanisms in bacteria while inducing bone repair through osteogenic and angiogenic coupling, making this platform a promising multi&#8208;functional strategy for treating and repairing complex bone infections.

         <title>Two&#8208;color Amplified Spontaneous Emission from Liquid Suspensions of Engineered Quantum Dots with Suppressed Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal quantum&#8208;dot (QD) lasing is normally achieved in close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, as a high QD volume fraction is required for stimulated emission to outcompete fast Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multiexciton states. Here we demonstrate a new type of optical&#8208;gain medium in which QDs are liquefied using a small amount of a solvent. This high&#8208;density QD suspension behaves as a transparent liquid which can be handled as a traditional laser dye. To test the utility of these liquid media as lasing materials, we use recently developed compact compositionally&#8208;graded QDs (ccg&#8208;QDs) that feature strong suppression of Auger decay. Transient absorption measurements of ccg&#8208;QD liquid suspensions reveal broad&#8208;band optical gain spanning a wide spectral range from 560&#160;nm (green) to 675&#160;nm (red). The gain magnitude is sufficient to realize a two&#8208;color amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 637&#160;nm and 594&#160;nm due to the band&#8208;edge (1S) and the excited&#8208;state (1P) transition, respectively. Importantly, the ASE regime is achieved using quasi&#8208;continuous excitation with nanosecond pulses. Furthermore, the ASE is highly stable under prolonged excitation. This stands in contrast to traditional dyes that exhibit strong degradation under identical excitation conditions. These observations point towards a considerable potential of high&#8208;density ccg&#8208;QD suspensions as liquid, dye&#8208;like optical gain media that feature readily achievable spectral tunability and stable operation under intense photoexcitation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal quantum-dot (QD) lasing is normally achieved in close-packed solid-state films, as a high QD volume fraction is required for stimulated emission to outcompete fast Auger decay of optical-gain-active multiexciton states. Here we demonstrate a new type of optical-gain medium in which QDs are liquefied using a small amount of a solvent. This high-density QD suspension behaves as a transparent liquid which can be handled as a traditional laser dye. To test the utility of these liquid media as lasing materials, we use recently developed compact compositionally-graded QDs (ccg-QDs) that feature strong suppression of Auger decay. Transient absorption measurements of ccg-QD liquid suspensions reveal broad-band optical gain spanning a wide spectral range from 560&#160;nm (green) to 675&#160;nm (red). The gain magnitude is sufficient to realize a two-color amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 637&#160;nm and 594&#160;nm due to the band-edge (1S) and the excited-state (1P) transition, respectively. Importantly, the ASE regime is achieved using quasi-continuous excitation with nanosecond pulses. Furthermore, the ASE is highly stable under prolonged excitation. This stands in contrast to traditional dyes that exhibit strong degradation under identical excitation conditions.

         <title>2H&#8208;2&#160;M Phase Control of WSe2 Nanosheets by Se Enrichment Toward Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The phase control of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is an intriguing approach for tuning the electronic structure towards extensive applications. In this study, WSe2 nanosheets synthesized via a colloidal reaction exhibited a phase conversion from semiconducting 2H to metallic 2&#160;M under Se&#8208;rich growth conditions (i.e., increasing the concentration of Se precursor or lowering the growth temperature). High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy images were used to identify the stacking sequence of the 2&#160;M phase, which is distinctive from that of the 1T&#8242; phase. First&#8208;principles calculations employing various Se&#8208;rich models (intercalation and substitution) indicated that Se enrichment induces conversion to the 2&#160;M phase. The 2&#160;M phase WSe2 nanosheets with the Se excess exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure studies suggested that the excess Se atoms in the 2&#160;M phase WSe2 enhanced the HER catalytic activity, which was supported by the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) of H adsorption and the Fermi abundance function. These results provide an appealing strategy for phase control of TMD catalysts.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach to Simulate the Nonlinear Optical Response of Molecular Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nonlinear optics is essential for many recent photonic technologies. Here, we&#160;introduce a novel multi&#8208;scale approach to simulate the nonlinear optical response of molecular nanomaterials combining ab initio quantum&#8208;chemical and classical Maxwell&#8208;scattering computations. In this approach, the first hyperpolarizability tensor is computed with time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory and incorporated into a multi&#8208;scattering formalism that considers the optical interaction between neighboring molecules. Such incorporation is achieved by a novel object: the Hyper&#8208;Transition(T)&#8208;matrix. With this object at hand, the nonlinear optical response from single molecules and also from entire photonic devices can be computed, including the full tensorial and dispersive nature of the optical response of the molecules, as well as the optical interaction between different molecules as, for example, in the lattice of a molecular crystal. To demonstrate the applicability of our&#160;novel approach, the generation of a second&#8208;harmonic signal from a thin film of an Urea molecular crystal is computed and compared to more traditional simulations. Furthermore, an optical cavity is designed, which enhances the second&#8208;harmonic response of the molecular film up to more than two orders of magnitude. Our&#160;approach is highly versatile and accurate and can be the working horse for the future exploration of nonlinear photonic molecular materials in structured photonic&#160;environments.

         <title>Nuclear Spin&#8208;Depleted, Isotopically Enriched 70Ge/28Si70Ge Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The p&#8208;symmetry of the hole wavefunction is associated with a weaker hyperfine interaction, which makes hole spin qubits attractive candidates for quantum processors. However, recent studies demonstrated that hole qubits are still very sensitive to nuclear spin bath, thus highlighting the need for nuclear spin&#8208;free Ge qubits to suppress this decoherence channel. Herein, this work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of 73Ge&#8208;depleted isotopically enriched 70Ge/SiGe quantum wells. The growth was&#160;achieved by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition using isotopically purified monogermane 70GeH4 and monosilane 28SiH4 with an isotopic purity higher than 99.9 % and 99.99 %, respectively. The quantum wells consist of a series of 70Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Si wafers using a Ge virtual substrate and a graded SiGe buffer layer. The isotopic purity is investigated using atom probe tomography following an analytical procedure addressing the discrepancies in the isotopic content caused by the overlap of isotope peaks in mass spectra. The nuclear spin background in the quantum wells was&#160;found to be sensitive to the growth conditions. The lowest concentration of nuclear spin&#8208;full isotopes 73Ge and 29Si in the heterostructure was&#160;established at 0.01 % in the Ge quantum well and SiGe barriers. The measured average distance between nuclear spins reaches 3&#8208;4 nm in 70Ge/28Si70Ge, which is an order of magnitude larger than in natural Ge/SiGe heterostructures.
