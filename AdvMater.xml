Turing&#8208;Patterned Substrates
The untapped potential of Turing patterns in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers a transformative frontier. This illustration shows that Turing&#8208;nanoarchitected Ag needle enables dual&#8208;scale enhancement via mesoscopic light manipulation and microscopic molecular enrichment. Moreover, the injector&#8208;integrated design further unveils remarkable promise for field&#8208;deployable SERS diagnostics in solid matrices. More details can be found in article number 2506426 by Wei Ji, Yukihiro Ozaki, Yunfei Xie, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Selective Terahertz&#8208;Nanodisc Metasurfaces for Exploring Neurotransmitter Dynamics beyond Spectral Limitations (Adv. Mater. 41/2025)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>

Exploring Neurotransmitter Dynamics
Optical investigation of molecular dynamics occurring within the biomimetic human biosensor system, especially under water environment, has been regarded as a challenging area of study. Based on the great advantage of spectral capabilities of terahertz spectroscopic tools, a unique biosensing platform has been proposed assisted by nanodisc&#8208;hybridized nanoscale metasurfaces. The sensing capability was determined to enable the receptor&#8208;ligand interactions occurring at optical hotspots, where the terahertz field was strongly localized and greatly enhanced, and controlled by targeting specific frequency of the metasurface. More details can be found in article number 2504858 by Hyun Seok Song, Minah Seo, and co&#8208;workers.

Triboelectric Nanogenerators
This illustration highlights polyelectrolyte&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators that achieve tunable tribopolarity and enhanced environmental stability through covalently fixed ionic groups. Systematic variation of polycation and polyanion compositions with different cations and anions enables consistent ion redistribution and predictable polarity shifts along the triboelectric series. This strategy provides a versatile and modular platform for stable energy&#8208;harvesting devices under heat and humidity. More details can be found in article number 2505547 by Ju&#8208;Hyuck Lee, Wonho Lee, and co&#8208;workers.

Morphing Matter Soft Robot
This cover illustrates a morphing matter soft robot controlled by remote electric fields. The robot is made of an elastomeric composite with nano paracrystalline carbon. When exposed to a nonuniform electric field, dielectrophoretic forces causes the robot to locomote, bend, stretch, and twist. Simultaneously, charge concentrations at the ends of the robot result in like&#8208;charge repulsion and finger&#8208;like protrusions. Soft morphing matter exhibits attractive remote&#8208;control morphogenetic actuation for next&#8208;generation soft robots. More details can be found in article number 2419077 by Ciqun Xu, Charl Faul, Majid Taghavi, and Jonathan Rossiter.

In Materia Reservoir Computing
Light&#8208;induced molecular dynamics in azopolymers can be exploited for data storage and neuromorphic&#8208;type of data processing, emulating a wide range of synaptic functionalities including long&#8208;term, short&#8208;term and visual memory. The adaptiveness of this light&#8208;responsive material can be exploited for spatiotemporal event detection and visual motion perception tasks, as well as for in&#8208;materia implementation of reservoir computing. More details can be found in the Research Article by Gianluca Milano, Angelo Angelini, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202501813).

Heterojunction&#8208;Driven Stochasticity
In article number 2505150, Hocheon Yoo and co&#8208;workers present a bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance transistor, which amplifies intrinsic noise and entropy throughput. This enables the generation of multi&#8208;bit true random numbers from amplified intrinsic noise, which are then used as latent vectors to drive high&#8208;fidelity image synthesis.

The fascinating properties of LCEs demonstrate outstanding potential in biomimetic soft robots. From the novel perspective of integrated material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, this paper systematically reviewed the latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators, including plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. The potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed.








Abstract
After 30 years of development, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) biomimetic soft robots have been engineered to possess the capability to mimic and surpass the locomotion of soft organisms. However, most of the current reviews on LCEs are focused on their material/alignment design, fabrication technologies, actuation mechanisms, and applications. The latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators is systematically reviewed here from a novel perspective of material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, which includes plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. In addition, the potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed, where further in&#8208;depth research is required. Directions and valuable insights are provided for subsequent research efforts. This paper offers an inspiring and critical overview of the significant progress in the field of smart biomimetic LCE soft robotics and provides an available guide for researchers who are considering entering the exciting domain of LCE soft actuators.

         <title>Beyond Presumptions: Toward Mechanistic Clarity in Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Catalysts for Electrochemical H2O2 Production via Data Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>

Metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts enable the sustainable synthesis of hydrogen peroxide via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction; however, active site complexity continues to hinder reliable interpretation. This review critiques correlation&#8208;based approaches and highlights the importance of orthogonal experimental designs, standardized catalyst passports, multivariate statistics, and explainable machine learning integrated with operando spectroscopy to identify accurate catalytic descriptors for rational catalyst development.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, featuring tunable structures, readily available precursors, and excellent stability, have garnered significant attention for sustainable H2O2 production. However, despite extensive investigations, the precise mechanisms underlying catalytic selectivity on these carbon materials remain unclear and highly debated. Previous mechanistic interpretations frequently attribute catalytic activity to specific oxygen functional groups or heteroatom dopants through correlation&#8208;driven hypotheses and simplified theoretical models. Such approaches often overlook the intrinsic complexity of carbon surfaces, where multiple variables, including dopant types, defect structures, surface groups, and hybridization states, coexist and interact simultaneously, leading to contradictory conclusions. This review critically examines&#160;the limitations of these traditional approaches and emphasize the need of systematic experimental designs that independently vary structural parameters, along with advanced analytical methods capable of resolving active&#8208;site ambiguity, are critically reviewed. Recent developments employing orthogonal material libraries, rigorous experimental controls, catalyst passport metadata, and advanced multivariate and meta&#8208;analytical tools have emerged as robust frameworks for bias&#8208;resistant catalyst design. Integrating explainable and generative machine learning models with operando spectroscopy provides a robust, end&#8208;to&#8208;end approach for identifying and validating accurate catalytic descriptors.

Heat generation mechanisms including Joule heating, electromagnetic induction, and electromagnetic radiation and heat transfer mechanisms such as fluid convection are discussed. Advances in materials are grouped into two areas: heating materials, primarily based on nanomaterials, and thermally responsive materials including hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers, and shape&#8208;memory polymers. Structural designs, such as extension, bending, twisting, and 3D deformable configurations, are explored for enabling complex and precise movements. Applications of soft thermal actuators span environmental exploration, gripping and manipulation, biomedical devices for rehabilitation and surgery, and interactive systems for virtual/augmented reality and therapy. The review concludes with an outlook on challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for further improvement in speed, energy efficiency, and intelligent soft robotic systems. By bridging fundamental principles with cutting&#8208;edge applications, this review aims to inspire further advancements in the field of thermally actuated soft robotics.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Alicyclic Dipolar Glass Dielectric Polymer Capacitors for Superior High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address multiple material paradoxes (Eg&#8208;Tg, &#603;r&#8208;Eg, self&#8208;healing&#8208;Tg), semi&#8208;alicyclic dipolar glass polymers (sAl&#8208;DG) is designed with alternating non&#8208;conjugated alicyclic and dipolar aromatic units. The alicyclic unit provides large bandgap and self&#8208;healing, while the dipolar unit offers high polarization and thermal stability. sAl&#8208;DG achieves an excellent discharge energy density with 90% efficiency U&#951;90 &#8776; 3.94 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;power&#8208;density metallized film capacitors at elevated temperatures and electric field extremes are key components in electrical and electronic systems. The miniaturization, integration, and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the systems demand high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, high&#8208;efficiency, and reliable dielectrics. A major challenge is to concurrently break multiple paradoxes of bandgap (Eg) with glass transition temperature (Tg), dielectric constant (&#603;r) with Eg, and self&#8208;healing capability with Tg. In this contribution, a class of semi&#8208;alicyclic dipolar glass dielectric polymers (sAl&#8208;DG) is developed, with an alternating non&#8208;conjugated alicyclic unit and a strong dipolar group aromatic unit. The alicyclic unit synergistically confers a large Eg and the potential for strong self&#8208;healing while the other unit concurrently endows high polarization and thermal stability, effectively decoupling the multiple paradoxes. As a result, sAl&#8208;DG delivers large Eg with 3.99&#8211;4.26 eV, high Tg with 218&#8211;387 &#176;C, high &#603;r with 3.39&#8211;3.71 (200&#176;C, 1 kHz) and simultaneously excellent self&#8208;healing ability with self&#8208;healing energy of 15.03 mJ. Hence, this molecular decoupling strategy enables a superior discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency (U&#951;90) of up to 6.2 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3.94 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C. Plus, a stacked sAl&#8208;DG capacitor demonstrates 1.06 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 94% efficiency under 250 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#176;C, showcasing operational viability.

         <title>Sequential DNA Coding for Programmable Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel programmable encryption strategy with controllable DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin&#8208;mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the dynamic generation of DNA sequences and the secure recording of information with user&#8208;specific access. This approach enhances data security, positioning DNA as a high&#8208;performance material to meet future confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands.









Abstract
DNA molecules, with highly variable sequences and inherent programmability, emerge as a promising material for next&#8208;generation information storage and data encryption. However, due to the singular encryption method or limited randomness of the secret key, current encryptions remain vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks and the need for enhanced information security persists. This study introduces a programmable encryption strategy based on long&#8208;chain DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin&#8208;mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the generation of DNA keys and the recording of encoded information. Ultimately, encrypted text and image data can be decoded and retrieved through sequencing with customized access based on user permissions.

     alt="Sequential DNA Coding for Programmable Information Encryption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel programmable encryption strategy with controllable DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin-mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the dynamic generation of DNA sequences and the secure recording of information with user-specific access. This approach enhances data security, positioning DNA as a high-performance material to meet future confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA molecules, with highly variable sequences and inherent programmability, emerge as a promising material for next-generation information storage and data encryption. However, due to the singular encryption method or limited randomness of the secret key, current encryptions remain vulnerable to brute-force attacks and the need for enhanced information security persists. This study introduces a programmable encryption strategy based on long-chain DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin-mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the generation of DNA keys and the recording of encoded information. Ultimately, encrypted text and image data can be decoded and retrieved through sequencing with customized access based on user permissions. This approach positions DNA as a high-performance information material and establishes a programmable encryption framework, offering strong potential to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands of future information security systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vascularized and Perfusable Human Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Model Recapitulates Aspects of Myocardial Ischemia and Enables Analysis of Nanomedicine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel 3D human ischemic heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip, with perfusable vasculature directly interfaced with myocardial tissue, replicates key aspects of ischemic heart injury. It also demonstrates the targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy of cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes, validating the platform for drug and nanomedicine screening in myocardial ischemia.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of CVDs are not yet fully understood, and animal models do not accurately replicate human heart function. Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technologies with increasing complexity are being developed to mimic aspects of native human cardiac physiology for mechanistic studies and as screening platforms for drugs and nanomedicines. Here, a 3D human myocardial ischemia&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform incorporating perfusable vasculature in direct contact with myocardial regions is designed. Infusing a vasoconstrictor cocktail, including angiotensin II and phenylephrine, into this heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip model leads to increased arrhythmias in cardiomyocyte pacing, fibroblast activation, and damage to blood vessels, all of which are hallmarks of ischemic heart injury. To verify the potential of this platform for drug and nanocarrier screening, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is conducted with cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes containing Alamandine. This nanomedicine formulation enhances targeting to the ischemia model, alleviates myocardial ischemia&#8208;related characteristics, and improves cardiomyocyte beating. This confirms that the vascularized chip model of human myocardial ischemia provides both functional and mechanistic insights into myocardial tissue pathophysiology and can contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling medicines.

         <title>Electric Field Driven Soft Morphing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents soft morphing matter robots that exhibit extremely high morphological adaptability and complex multimodal electric field response. They can undergo large, controlled body deformation and show complex locomotion on different terrains under the manipulation of external electric fields, making a significant step beyond current electroactive and soft robots.








Abstract
The manipulation of soft morphing robots using external electric fields and wireless control is challenging. Electric field&#8208;driven soft morphing matter, termed electro&#8208;morphing gel (e&#8208;MG), that exhibits complex multimodal large&#8208;scale deformation (showing up to 286% strain, and strain rates up to 500%&#160;s&#8722;1) and locomotion under external electric fields applied using compact and lightweight electrodes is presented. The distinctive capabilities of e&#8208;MG derive from the combination of an elastomeric matrix and nanoparticulate paracrystalline carbon. The material properties, electroactive principle, and control strategies are explored and demonstrate fundamental morphing matter behaviors including rotating, translating, stretching, spreading, bending, and twisting. A range of potential bio&#8208;inspired applications, including slim mold&#8208;like spreading, snail&#8208;like jumping over a gap, object transport, wall climbing, and a frog tongue&#8208;inspired gripper is shown. The e&#8208;MG provides morphing capabilities beyond the current limitations in wireless control for a wide range of applications in soft and bio&#8208;inspired robotics, dexterous manipulation, and space exploration.

         <title>Thiophene Expanded Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer as Hole Transport Layer for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 20.78%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed two thiophene expanded self&#8208;assembled monolayers, which shows better structural order that helps to enlarge the dipole moment, improve the hole extraction ability, and suppress the charge recombination, thus yielded an impressive efficiency of 20.78% for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transport layers (HTLs) have achieved groundbreaking progress of device efficiency in perovskite and organic photovoltaics. Expanding the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of carbazole is an effective approach to enhance the molecular dipole moment and facilitate charge extraction of SAMs. However, this strategy tends to cause poor solubility and excessive self&#8208;aggregation of SAMs. In this work, two highly efficient SAMs are developed by substituting a non&#8208;fused thiophene unit on 3,6&#8208;position of carbazole, namely (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonate (2PAThCz) and diethyl (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonate (4PAThCz). The introduction of thiophene can completely alter the molecular packing behavior of SAM, promoting more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and increasing dipole moment, which enhances hole transport. Furthermore, the long spacer length on 4PAThCz enable to help it achieves excellent solubility, inhibit self&#8208;aggregation, and strengthen the molecular orderliness. As a result, an impressive efficiency of 20.78% (certified as 20.45%) is achieved for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Toughened 2D Moir&#233; Superlattice Membranes with Extreme Thermal Shock Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D moir&#233; superlattice composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) demonstrates exceptional fracture toughness, primarily attributed to hBN's crack deflection and bifurcation mechanisms. Notably, this robust membrane withstands 200 extreme thermal shock cycles up to 1800 K at a heating rate of 10&#8308; K s&#8315;&#185;. Such remarkable thermal stability facilitates the successful synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles.








Abstract
Excellent mechanical strength and toughness are demanded for two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) membranes in various applications to withstand extreme strain and temperature changes and resist crack propagation. However, the trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness poses significant challenges in meeting these requirements. This study presents a self&#8208;toughened 2D moir&#233; superlattice membrane composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) that exhibits high mechanical strength. The intrinsic toughness originates from the high energy release rate associated with the crack deflection and bifurcation in hBN. Remarkably, this robust membrane endures 200 cycles of thermal shock up to 1800 K with 104 K s&#8722;1 heating rate, during which high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) are successfully synthesized. The findings pave the way for the design and fabrication of robust 2D superlattices, facilitating future exploration under extreme conditions.

         <title>Activating Ferroelectric&#8208;Magnetic Synergistic Effects at Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces Toward Superfast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve high energy density and fast&#8208;charging capability in layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, a surface modification strategy is employed to enable ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, this work unveils the optimization mechanism by which such synergistic effects enhance the electrochemical performance of layered cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxides are promising cathode candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density. However, the rate and cycling performances are hindered by severe interfacial side reactions and sluggish kinetics. Using NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (NM) as a model material, ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects are activated at the NM&#8208;electrolyte interfaces via constructing a multiferroic layer on the NM surface, significantly realizing the superfast and stable sodium storage. First, the nucleation and growth of interfacial layers are regulated by ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects, resulting in the formation of a thin interfacial layer enriched with NaF. Second, a uniform sodium&#8208;ion distribution at the NM&#8208;electrolyte interfaces is established, boosting the charge transfer kinetics. Third, the distortion of NiO6 local structure is reduced, minimizing the structural change and improving the cycling stability. As a result, superior cycling (82.1% retention after 1000 cycles) and rate capabilities (up to 50&#8211;100C) in half cells, as well as high energy densities (340.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and fast&#8208;charging properties (&#8776;113 s per charge with &#8776;240.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 input) in full cells, are achieved. This work presents a novel strategy for improving rate and cycling capabilities by harnessing ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects, offering a pathway for designing advanced electrodes in secondary batteries.

         <title>Programming Defects and Cavities into Colloidal Crystals Engineered With DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seed&#8208;mediated crystallization is adapted for colloidal crystals to design cavities and defect architectures through chemically programmed DNA sequences and appropriate seed particle geometry. This synthetic approach combines tenets from both atomic and colloidal crystallization to deliberately control defect formation in superlattices and enables the design of functional materials with unusual and tailorable properties.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from seed&#8208;mediated crystal growth in atomic and molecular systems, a strategy is developed for incorporating particle and volume defects into the interior of colloidal crystals consisting of programmable atom equivalents (PAEs, oligonucleotide&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles) assembled with DNA. Discrete PAEs spanning a range of shapes, sizes, and compositions serve as nucleation sites for seed&#8208;mediated colloidal crystal growth and are incorporated into the centers of colloidal crystal lattices as cavities. Importantly, seed PAE shapes or sizes that are geometrically mismatched with the colloidal crystal lattice symmetry introduce defects such as local lattice disorder and long&#8208;range grain boundaries that arise through geometric frustration. Colloidal crystals synthesized with plasmonic seed particles exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelength scattering cross&#8208;sections that are highly dependent upon cavity/particle size and shape. Taken together, these findings establish a platform for the deliberate introduction of 2 and 3D defects into colloidal crystals, which may inform the design of structures and materials for thermal management, sensing, and catalysis.

         <title>Dual Optimization of Electrolyte and Interface in Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 via Ga3+ Doping for Advanced Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study incorporates Ga3+ into Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3, effectively suppressing the formation of the low&#8208;conductivity &#946;&#8242; phase and significantly reducing stacking faults in the sintered samples, while also enhancing the wettability between the electrolyte and sodium metal. The in situ formed Na&#8208;Ga alloy interface further strengthens the stability of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact.








Abstract
Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 is a highly promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (SSSBs) with a wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability against metallic sodium. However, its practical application is hindered by the instability of &#946;&#8243; phase (R3&#175;$\bar 3$m) during sintering, low polycrystalline ionic conductivity at room temperature, and poor interfacial contact with sodium anodes. In this study, a stablized SSSB is obtained via doping Ga3+ into Na1.67Mg0.67Al10.33O17 (NMAO), which also suppresses the formation of the &#946;&#8242; phase (P63/mmc) and decreases stacking faults. After sintering at 1550 &#176;C for 2 h, Na1.67Mg0.67Al9.33GaO17 (NMA9.33GO) exhibits an ionic conductivity of 9.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, &#8776;1.7 times greater than NMAO. Furthermore, Ga3+ doping enhances the wettability with sodium, achieving superior contact stability and the formation of Na&#8208;Ga alloys at the interface significantly improves electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact stability, achieving a high critical current density (CCD) of 0.8 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low interfacial impedance of 16 &#937; cm2. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a high discharge capacity of 91 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C, and maintaining 87% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work provides new insights into improving electrolyte performance and interfacial engineering through doping strategies, thereby promoting the development of efficient and long&#8208;term SSSBs.

         <title>Deterministic Memristive Polarization Switching in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work emphasizes the achievement of deterministic multilevel polarization in rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through crystallographically &#8208; guided domain engineering, precisely controlling domain switching, overcoming the bistable limitations of traditional ferroelectrics, and providing an innovative strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The burgeoning field of neuromorphic computing demands ferroelectric materials exhibiting memristive multilevel polarization to enable high&#8208;density memory storage and brain&#8208;inspired devices. Here, it is demonstrated deterministic multilevel polarization in a relaxor ferroelectric&#8208;rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through domain engineering, achieving precise control over stepwise domain switching. Using reciprocal space mapping (RSM) and in situ second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), it is shown that optimized electric pulses guide multi&#8208;domain switching to a 4R engineered domain state, stabilizing memristive behavior. In situ characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy, reveal that the memristive behavior arises from local domain rearrangements rather than crystal structure transitions. The resulting multilevel polarization states with up to 20 levels exhibit robust retention (&gt;104 s) and fatigue resistance (&gt;105 cycles) while maintaining high polarizability. Phase&#8208;field simulations corroborate these findings, offering microscopic insights into the repeatability of multilevel polarization. This approach overcomes the bistable limitations of conventional ferroelectrics, enabling stable multilevel polarization states that modulate mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. This results provide a versatile strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors, advancing neuromorphic and reconfigurable computing with minimal compromise in ferroelectric performance.

         <title>A Scalable Fishbone Nanowire Array (FINE) for 3D Quasi&#8208;Intracellular Recording in Intact Brains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles on the sides of an implantable shank records 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.








Abstract
Intracellular recordings provide unique access to the submillisecond neuronal membrane potential changes, revealing dynamics that orchestrate cellular, local, and large&#8208;scale brain activity. However, technical requirements limit the scalability of intracellular recordings to large populations of neurons, especially within intact brains. To overcome this limitation, a Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) is developed with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles along an implantable shank to record 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. A novel fabrication process is developed to integrate reverse&#8208;angled platinum silicide (PtSi) nanowires to preserve the structural integrity of FINE during insertion. As&#8208;implanted or sub&#8208;micron retraced FINE spreads the PtSi nanowires away from the shank to establish intimate nanowire&#8208;neuron interfaces that yield quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials. Comparative analyses of nanowire recordings versus adjacent planar recordings on the same shank validate their distinctive quasi&#8208;intracellular recording characteristics. The scalability of FINE is demonstrated to a 3D 24&#8208;shank array with 594 nanowires and 430 planar contacts and successfully identified quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials across 127 distinct nanowires in the intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations and patterns of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.

         <title>Vacancy Functionalized MoS2 Nanolaminated Membranes for Efficient Sieving in Forward Osmosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur vacancy functionalization strategy is proposed for fabricating high performance nanolaminate membranes by grafting three kinds of thiol (S&#8208;H) containing molecules (Cysteine, 3&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol, 1&#8208;Propanethiol) on MoS2 nanosheets, in which propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits best salt rejection (99.3%) and water/salt selectivity (800 bar&#8722;1) in forward osmosis.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based nanolaminates are promising candidates for water purification. However, fabricating nanochannels with tunable capillary widths remain a challenge. This study proposed a sulfur vacancy functionalization strategy for fabricating high performance nanolaminate membranes by grafting three kinds of thiol (S&#8208;H) containing molecules (Cysteine, 3&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol, 1&#8208;Propanethiol) on MoS2 nanosheets, in which propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibited best salt rejection (99.3%) and water/salt selectivity (800&#160;bar&#8722;1) in forward osmosis (draw solution: sucrose solution). It is found the capillary width increased from 0.2 &#197; in pristine MoS2 to &#8776;5 &#197; in propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membranes. Numerical simulations suggest that nanofluidic properties of the functionalized membranes are governed by the fundamental interaction between water and the corresponding S&#8208;H functional group, and the interlayer distance. Importantly, since the S&#8208;H containing molecules can repair MoS2 nanosheets by fitting into the sulfur vacancies, the stability of the membranes is also improved with minimal swelling, which is promising for their practical applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Selective Terahertz&#8208;Nanodisc Metasurfaces for Exploring Neurotransmitter Dynamics beyond Spectral Limitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Observation and detection of neurotransmitter dynamics in aqueous system has been hurdle for analytical fields due to its weak and reversible nature. A terahertz&#8208;nanodisc metasurface which implements comprehensive detection over conformational change and selective sensing is introduced. Utilizing the THz regime photonics and biomimetic environment with nanodisc, the proposed biosensing platform provides comprehensive insight over receptor&#8208;ligand dynamics and molecular sensing.








Abstract
The rapid growth of nanotechnology and spectroscopic techniques has accelerated the development of biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity. Nanoscale metasurfaces can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional optical methods, such as low responsivity and molecular specificity. One promising approach for analyzing subtle biochemical changes that occur in complex biological phenomena is to use terahertz metasurfaces. Here, the aim is to develop a dual&#8208;selective terahertz nanodisc metasurface that enabled precise monitoring of neurotransmitter dynamics in a biomimetic environment. Utilizing functionalized terahertz metasurfaces with nanodisc that mimic biosensory receptors, a biosensor selective for both molecular type and resonant frequency is developed. The sensing platform ensures significantly enhanced sensitivity and specificity by recognizing the intermolecular changes associated with serotonin&#8208;nanodisc binding and aqueous surrounding effects. The proposed biosensor can potentially provide an efficient tool for studying complex biochemical interactions, and find application in biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience research.

         <title>Conformal Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Silicon: Toward Bio&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Infrared Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformal Mac&#8208;imprint technology employs stretchable porous polymer stamps coated with a gold catalyst that are pneumatically actuated against curved silicon lenses, electrochemically carving micrometer, hierarchical sharklet patterns in a single maskless step. The centimeter&#8208;scale metasurfaces exhibit &lt;1% pitch error, broadband anti&#8208;reflection, offering a durable and robust monolithic pathway to micro&#8208;machining multifunctional photonic coating for harsh environments such as space exploration and the battlefield.








Abstract
Nanostructured anti&#8208;reflection metasurfaces for infrared lenses are designed for imaging in harsh environments such as dust (e.g., moon or battlefield), micrometeorites (e.g., Lagrange points), and high&#8208;radiation fluctuations (e.g., Mars) with limited lifetimes. These multifunctional optical meta&#8208;surfaces (MOMS) simultaneously deliver high thermal stability and anti&#8208;fouling behavior due to their monolithic nature (e.g., no mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion), hydrophobicity, and low dust adherence. However, the incompatibility of inorganic semiconductor micromachining with non&#8208;planar substrates has limited MOMS to polymeric and glass lenses. Here, a new method of conformal electrochemical nanoimprinting is presented to directly micromachine a nature&#8208;inspired MOMS onto a silicon lens. Uniquely, stretchablegold&#8208;coated&#160;patterned&#160;porous PVDF stamps are made by lithographically templated thermally induced phase separation (lt&#8208;TIPS), which simultaneously embeds it with (i) interconnected porosity for promoting mass transport, (ii) HF&#8208;resistance for increasing operational lifetime, and (iii) stretchable electronic nanocoatings (i.e., Au) that can catalyze the electrochemical process. In a demonstration of its hierarchical micromachining capability, a sharklet microscale pattern is successfully transferred to a silicon lens with anti&#8208;reflective and hydrophobic properties. This work paves the way for MOMS&#8217; extension onto inorganic semiconductors and IR lenses.

         <title>Revisiting The Role of Entropy for Charge Separation in 1D Pi&#8208;Conjugated Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes solution&#8208;phase microwave conductivity to study charge generation in a 1D model system of semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (s&#8208;SWCNTs) in low&#8208;dielectric solvent. The observation of high conductivity, even for much less than one dopant per s&#8208;SWCNT on average, demonstrates that entropy plays a key role in facilitating charge carrier escape in 1D systems, despite prior suggestions to the contrary.









Abstract
Free carrier generation in organic donor/acceptor heterojunctions and redox&#8208;doped organic semiconductors is poorly understood, since assumed tight electron&#8211;hole binding conflicts with observed high free carrier yields.

     alt="Revisiting The Role of Entropy for Charge Separation in 1D Pi-Conjugated Semiconductors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study utilizes solution-phase microwave conductivity to study charge generation in a 1D model system of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) in low-dielectric solvent. The observation of high conductivity, even for much less than one dopant per s-SWCNT on average, demonstrates that entropy plays a key role in facilitating charge carrier escape in 1D systems, despite prior suggestions to the contrary.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free carrier generation in organic donor/acceptor heterojunctions and redox-doped organic semiconductors is poorly understood, since assumed tight electron&#8211;hole binding conflicts with observed high free carrier yields. Cornerstone analyses that have guided the field for over 15 years predict that entropy can stabilize free charges in 2D and 3D pi-conjugated semiconductors but not in 1D systems. Here, the impact of entropy on charge generation in 1D pi-conjugated semiconductors is revisited by exploiting a greatly simplified system where enthalpy considerations alone should not allow for free charge generation. Noncontact solution-phase microwave conductivity is used to investigate the carrier density-dependent conductivity and dielectric constant in isolated chemically doped semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes in a low-dielectric solvent. Dopant chemical structure dramatically influences the carrier density-dependent complex conductivity, with bulky dopants facilitating carrier escape even at carrier densities below one carrier per nanotube. Three distinct numerical calculations show that entropic stabilization dramatically lowers the Gibbs energy barrier for free charge generation, explaining the high yield of free carriers, even in 1D.

         <title>Stepped Disconnection&#8208;Contributing AgRuIr Nanocrystals with Turtle Shell&#8208;Shaped Oxide Layer for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepped disconnections provide broken local spatial symmetry, tailored electronic bands structures and localized chemical environments that enhance catalytic activity. Herein, ultrafine AgRuIr nanocrystals with dense stepped disconnections are prepared by introducing large&#8208;sized Ag atoms preferentially located at the line defects between the nanocrystalline domains divided by the stepped disconnection&#8208;mediated grain boundaries, via fast and non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization.








Abstract
Stepped disconnections enable innovative catalyst design by breaking spatial symmetry, tailoring electronic bands, and creating localized chemical environments for synergistic water oxidation catalysis. We developed ultrafine AgRuIr nanocrystals with dense stepped disconnections through rapid non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization using medium&#8208;temperature alcohol&#8208;assisted thermal reduction. Large&#8208;sized Ag atoms preferentially located at the line defects between the nanocrystalline domains divided by the stepped disconnection&#8208;mediated grain boundaries. The atomic Ag&#8208;stabilized stepped disconnections across nanocrystalline domains create turtle shell&#8208;shaped oxide layer with abnormal twisted strips, which remarkably enhance H2O adsorption and activation kinetics. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional acidic water oxidation performance with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 188 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;low 1.82 V electrolysis voltage at 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 in AgRuIr&#8741;Pt/C modules, achieving 42.81 kWh/kg H2 efficiency meeting DOE 2026 targets. Enhanced activity originates from abnormal H2O aggregation/activation along twisted strips containing disrupted oxygen/metal atoms at Ag&#8208;rich defect lines. Crucially, Ag&#8208;pinned stepped dislocations beneath the active oxide layer inhibit Ru/Ir leaching by elevating lattice diffusion barriers, ensuring operational stability. This work establishes a paradigm for designing next&#8208;generation proton exchange membrane water electrolysis catalysts through engineered stepped disconnection architectures that simultaneously optimize activity and durability.

         <title>Enhancing Li+ Kinetics Via Selective Repulsion&#8208;Adsorption and Intermolecular Ion&#8208;Conduction Layers for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces a PSS&#8208;MMT composite layer on the anode of anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries. PSS will self&#8208;assemble, and its non&#8208;polar components repel solvents while negatively charged MMT adsorbs Li&#8314;, accelerating desolvation and forming inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Within the layer, there is a Li+ transfer pathway between PSS and MMT with reduced migration barriers. Consequently, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries achieve stable cycle performance.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries, offer high energy density, but suffer from limited lifespan due to sluggish Li+ desolvation at the anode. Conventional artificial layers on the anode attract Li+ by polar groups, yet inadvertently accumulate solvent molecules near these polar layers, impede desolvation, and form an organic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with low ionic conductivity. Herein, a selective repulsion&#8208;adsorption strategy is proposed, achieved using a layer (MS layer, 35&#160;nm) comprising polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and montmorillonite (MMT). During electrospray fabrication, the PSS self&#8208;assemble, with non&#8208;polar benzene rings and C&#8208;H main chains facing outward, while the &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups are buried underneath. The non&#8208;polar components can repel polar solvent molecules, and negatively charged MMT will absorb Li+, suppressing solvent accumulation and facilitating desolvation. Meanwhile, the anions attracted by MMT will form an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI with superior ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the PSS&#8208;MMT interface forms a rapid Li+ transport pathway with reduced migration barriers. Consequently, anode&#8208;free MS&#8208;Cu||LFP cells operate over 350 cycles, increasing &#8776;200% compared with Cu||LFP cells. Additionally, 2 Ah anode&#8208;free MS&#8208;Cu||LFP (340&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and MS&#8208;Cu||NCM811 pouch cells (490&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) maintain 80% capacity after 100 and 50 cycles. This work presents an efficient strategy to enhance Li+ kinetics for high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Polyelectrolytes as a Stable and Tunable Platform for Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) are introduced as advanced materials for triboelectric nanogenerators, offering precise control over tribopolarity through selective ion fixation. The tunable triboelectric properties and reliable mechanical and thermal stability of PEs enable enhanced output performance and long&#8208;term reliability, establishing a foundation for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting and sensing technologies.








Abstract
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) provide a versatile material system for improving the efficiency and stability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Compared to conventional ionic liquids (ILs), which suffer from leakage, environmental instability, and limited durability, PEs feature covalently tethered ionic groups that enable precise tribopolarity control while preventing unwanted ion migration. By systematically varying polymer backbones and ionic compositions, including two polycations and three polyanions, tunable triboelectric behavior is demonstrated using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and TENG output measurements. The polymethyl acrylate (PMA)&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion shows strongly tribopositive behavior, producing 83 V compared to 45 V for PMA. The polystyrene (PS)&#8208;based polyanion&#160;with 10% ion inclusion exhibits strongly tribonegative behavior with 34 V, compared to 8 V for PS. Optimizing ion ratios enhances charge retention by suppressing excessive ionic conduction. The mechanical and thermal stability of PEs is demonstrated by output measurements over time; for example, the short&#8208;circuit current of PMA&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion remains nearly unchanged after 1 week at 60&#160;&#176;C, in contrast to an &#8776;27% drop observed in a polymer&#8208;IL system (poly(methyl methacrylate) with 10 wt% IL). These findings highlight the suitability of PEs as a robust, stable, and tunable platform for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;harvesting applications.

Self&#8208;assembled materials (SAMs) like [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) are commonly used as hole transport layers (HTLs) in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells. However, the poor wettability of perovskite precursor solutions on Me&#8208;4PACz and its polarity&#8208;induced aggregation hinder high&#8208;quality film formation. To address these challenges, albendazole (ALB) is introduced as a surface modifier for Me&#8208;4PACz. The ALB solution mitigates the aggregation of Me&#8208;4PACz and promotes the desorption and rearrangement process of weakly bound Me&#8208;4PACz molecules. Concurrently, its Lewis basic moiety improves film quality, reduces buried interfacial defects, and optimizes energy level alignment. Additionally, ALB forms directional &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with Me&#8208;4PACz, ultimately suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitating charge carrier transport. As a result, ALB&#8208;optimized inverted WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.68%, with unencapsulated devices retaining 93.87% of their initial efficiency after 736&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under illumination. Furthermore, integrating the ALB&#8208;modified semi&#8208;transparent perovskite top cell with a 1.03&#160;eV bandgap CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) bottom cell yields a four&#8208;terminal tandem device with an impressive total efficiency of 29.06%. This dual&#8208;objective strategy provides a simple and effective method for simultaneously improving the film quality of both the HTL and the perovskite layer.

         <title>Borate&#8208;Water&#8208;Based 3D&#8208;Slime Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This advanced material, composed of lithium borate, lithium salt, and water, is a quasi&#8208;solid that can be handled in air and has a 3D&#8208;conducting&#8208;interface network (3D&#8208;Slime&#8208;Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes: 3D&#8208;SLISE). The 3D&#8208;SLISE is nonflammable and can be used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, and its water solubility allows direct recycling of active materials. This technology can contribute to the creation of a battery&#8208;recycling society.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that do not use hazardous materials as electrolytes and are not flammable is progressing rapidly, however the production of sulfide&#8208;based SSBs requires strict low&#8208;dew&#8208;point control due to their high reactivity with atmospheric moisture and the concern of generating hydrogen sulfide, and several issues remain in terms of the cost and recyclability. Thus, low&#8208;cost facile materials and low&#8208;CO2&#8208;emission processes are necessary. With regard to oxide&#8208;type SSBs, which are attracting attention for their safety, there are issues with manufacturing suitability, as high&#8208;temperature sintering of oxide solid electrolyte particles is required. A new quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrolyte with 3D&#8208;ionic conduction and adhesive interfaces by combining amorphous Li2B4O7 and water (3D&#8208;Slime Interface Solid Electrolyte: 3D&#8208;SLISE) is synthesized without stringent dew point control and sintering. Electrode and electrolyte slurries containing 3D&#8208;SLISE are applied to current&#8208;collecting foils in air, naturally dried, and used to construct battery laminates. 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSBs (LiCoO2 cathode/3D&#8208;SLISE with 7 wt.% bound&#8208;water/Li4Ti5O12 or TiNb2O7 anodes) maintain several hundred cycles of charge/discharge as a 2.35&#160;V lithium&#8208;ion battery. The 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSB technology can promote the use of safe and low&#8208;cost batteries, eliminate the need for a dry room during manufacturing, and enable direct recycling of active materials.

         <title>Terahertz In&#8208;Sensor Computing Utilizing Photothermoelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi2Se3&#8208;based THz detection array, synthesized via low&#8208;temperature pulse irradiation, exhibits a tunable bidirectional response driven by the photothermoelectric effect. This self&#8208;powered sensor achieves a high responsivity of 200 V&#160;W&#8722;1 and an ultrafast response time of &lt;5 ms at 0.3 THz, enabling real&#8208;time in&#8208;sensor computing and facilitating high&#8208;precision object detection in biomedical and security applications.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) detection is pivotal for biomedical diagnostics and security screening, enabled by its non&#8208;ionizing nature and characteristic &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; spectra. However, weak THz&#8211;matter interactions, energy&#8208;intensive processing, and complex hardware integration hinder its practical use. To this aim, a layered bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3)&#8208;based THz detection array is fabricated via low&#8208;temperature pulse irradiation synthesis (PIS), exhibiting a tunable thermally coupled bidirectional response. The intrinsic photothermoelectric (PTE) effect enables adaptive in&#8208;sensor THz signal processing, achieving 200&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity and &lt;5&#160;ms response time at 0.3 THz in a self&#8208;powered mode. Integrated in&#8208;sensor computing enhances accuracy through real&#8208;time noise suppression, edge detection, and feature extraction. The array also demonstrates high imaging performance, with a &gt;90% recall rate for concealed object detection. This work provides a scalable, high&#8208;precision THz sensing platform with transformative potential for biomedical and security applications.

It is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries represent a compelling next&#8208;generation energy storage system with practical energy densities exceeding 700 Wh kg&#8722;1, offering a promising pathway beyond current lithium&#8208;ion technology. However, their commercial viability remains constrained by deleterious interfacial reactions between lithium metal anodes and polysulfide&#8208;containing electrolytes. Herein, it is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), strategically designed to reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries. LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species. The LiFPB&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits superior lithium metal compatibility, achieving a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59%. Consequently, Li&#8208;S cells demonstrate markedly improved capacity retention from 50.9% to 75.7% over 200 cycles. This strategy has been successfully scaled to Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells, achieving practical energy densities of 408 Wh kg&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 75 cycles. This work presents an effective approach to developing long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries through the rational design of electrolyte salt.

         <title>Multigrain Ruthenium Nanocrystals with Enriched (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) Facets for Enhanced Hydrogen Oxidation in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multigrain Ru nanocatalyst with abundant (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets shows&#160;exceptional hydrogen oxidation activity and stability up to 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in alkali. It achieves peak power densities of 1.06 and 1.31 W cm&#8315;2 in hydrogen&#8208;air and hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cells, respectively, and retains performance over 60 h with negligible decay.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based materials are promising alternatives to expensive platinum for the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but face stability issues due to the strong oxophilicity. Here, an oxidation&#8208;resistant ruthenium multigrain catalyst is reported that exposes rich (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets for high&#8208;performing HOR catalysis in alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst exhibits a high kinetic current density of 61&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 50&#160;mV, which is 25.6&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;times higher than that of commercial ruthenium&#8208;carbon and platinum&#8208;carbon catalysts, respectively. Moreover, it also demonstrates a wide stability window up to 0.3&#160;V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode and enhanced tolerance to carbon monoxide. An AEMFC containing this catalyst at the anode achieves peak power densities of 1.31 and 1.06&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under hydrogen&#8208;oxygen and hydrogen&#8208;air conditions at 90&#160;&#176;C, respectively, and operates steadily. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facet possesses a higher oxidation barrier and lower hydrogen oxidation barrier than the common (0002) facets, enabling the exceptional HOR performances in alkali.

         <title>Ah&#8208;Level Large&#8208;Format Fiber&#8208;Shaped Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Effective Field Homogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;format fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (L&#8208;FLIBs) beyond 2 m in length are developed by homogenizing the electric field along fiber axis. The as&#8208;assembled L&#8208;FLIBs can deliver a 0.4 W high power output, corresponding to a 40% power increment. Furthermore, an unprecedented single&#8208;cell capacity of &gt;1 Ah is achieved.








Abstract
Large&#8208;format fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (L&#8208;FLIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible and wearable electronics but suffer significant cell polarization and insufficient active material utilization after scaling up. The heterogeneous spatial electric field distribution fundamentally affects the electrochemical behavior and jeopardizes the performance of L&#8208;FLIBs, yet its influence on 1D fiber structures remains unexplored. Here, the electron transport mechanisms are systematically investigated and develop an optimized dual&#8208;terminal cell configuration for field homogenizing. Through equivalent circuit modeling and experimental validation, it is revealed that strategic electron collection terminal design establishes symmetric electric fields along the fiber length, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of electrochemical heterogeneity and enhancing the redox kinetics for L&#8208;FLIBs. Thereby, a 60% internal resistance reduction is achieved and successfully fabricated a 10&#8208;m&#8208;long L&#8208;FLIBs with an unprecedented 1 Ah high capacity for a single fiber cell. The practical capability of this design is demonstrated by integrating large&#8208;format batteries into a fabric power bank for portable electronics.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Atomic Metal Deposition for an Efficient Dual&#8208;Site Incorporated Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition method using metal carbonyl precursors at 100&#160;&#176;C. The approach is applicable not only to TiO2 but also to various carbon&#8208;based and oxide materials. Among these, W oxo&#8208;clusters stabilize surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 and have been effectively utilized in the benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol reaction. These findings highlight the potential of this simplified and energy&#8208;efficient method for the scalable production of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.








Abstract
A universal, low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition (LTAMD) strategy is herein reported for synthesis of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) using metal carbonyl precursors. This scalable approach enables the fabrication of diverse ADMCs with various transition metals, including W, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru, Rh, and Re on oxide and carbon&#8208;based supports. Tungsten&#8208;incorporated TiO2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic benzene oxidation activity, attributed to the generation of surface oxygen vacancies with Ti3+, which act as active reduction sites under aerobic conditions, facilitating the formation of reduced oxygen intermediates. It is demonstrated that tungsten plays a crucial role in stabilizing these oxygen vacancies and promoting electron&#8208;hole separation by accommodating photogenerated holes and activating the C&#9472;H bond of benzene. Leveraging dual&#8208;site photocatalysis, the tungsten&#8208;TiO2 system achieves a remarkable 42.7% yield in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol, with high recyclability over ten cycles. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental results, a distinct photocatalytic mechanism is unveiled, driven by the synergistic interaction between atomic tungsten and TiO2. This strategy not only enables the energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of a broad range of ADMCs on various supports but also enhances the intrinsic catalytic properties of the TiO2 photocatalyst without compromising its crystal or electronic structure.

Integrates electrochemically Turing&#8208;nanoarchitected Ag needle frameworks with conformal ZIF&#8208;8 coating, the hierarchical structure enables dual&#8208;scale enhancement that mesoscopic light manipulation and microscopic molecular enrichment. The injector&#8208;integrated design seamlessly interfaces with portable Raman systems, achieving rapid in situ detection of contaminants in untreated solid matrices with sub&#8208;millimeter spatial resolution&#8212;a transformative leap toward field&#8208;deployable chemical diagnostics.








Abstract
The spontaneous emergence of Turing patterns in biological systems has inspired advanced materials with superior performance, yet their untapped potential in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology offers a transformative frontier. Mirroring the anti&#8208;reflective coating of insect eyes, where Turing&#8208;patterned corneal protrusions form graded refractive index interfaces with the lens, a bioinspired integration of Turing&#8208;nanoarchitected Ag (TN&#8208;Ag) with in situ zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) growth is engineered. The electrochemically sculpted fractal framework on silver needles serves dual roles as plasmonic amplifiers and curvature&#8208;guided templates for ZIF&#8208;8 growth, spatially aligning electromagnetic hotspots with selective&#8208;enrichment porous channels. The TN&#8208;Ag/ZIF&#8208;8 hierarchical architecture enables dual&#8208;scale SERS enhancement through mesoscopic light modulation via refractive index gradients and microscopic molecular enrichment through size&#8208;selective pores. Leveraging 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid as a dual&#8208;recognition probe, this platform achieves ultrasensitive discrimination and detection of Hg2+ (10&#8722;10 m) and methylmercury (10&#8722;8&#160;m) with exceptional interference resistance and practical reliability. Further, its injector&#8208;integrated design permits direct sampling in untreated solid matrices while seamlessly interfacing with portable Raman systems, demonstrating readiness for real&#8208;world environmental monitoring and food safety diagnostics. By transmuting biomimetic principles into functional nanofabrication, this work establishes a universal paradigm for next&#8208;generation on&#8208;site chemical analysis, uniting biological design logic with engineered sensing demands.

         <title>Enabling Multielectron Reaction of Polyanionic Cathodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Calcium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is developed to unlock the persistent challenge of single electron transfer per ion insertion in polyanionic materials. The cathode achieves a 1.87&#8208;electron transfer in Ca&#8208;ion cells by in situ activated multielectron reaction, thus offering a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 for advanced calcium rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Polyanionic cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Ca2+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in propelling the development of calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs). However, polyanionic cathodes usually exhibit single&#8208;electron transfer per unit, rendering limited specific capacity and energy densities. Herein, a new polyanionic CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is proposed for high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable CIBs by unlocking 1.87&#8208;electron transfer per vanadium redox center during Ca ion insertion. The CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 cathode delivers a reversible calcium storage capacity of 162 mAh g&#8722;1 at an average voltage of &#8776;2.5 V at 10 mA g&#8722;1, featuring a record&#8208;high energy density of &#8776;400 Wh kg&#8722;1. The low volume changes (&#8710;V = 1.8%) and fast diffusion kinetics indicate excellent cycling stability of CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 with capacity retentions of 98.2% and 80.8% over 600 and 5000 cycles, respectively. In Ca metal full cells made from a Ca metal anode and a compatible electrolyte, the CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 presents a high energy density of 318 Wh kg&#8722;1 over 50 cycles, which rivals the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CIB performance. This work sheds new light on the electrochemically activated multielectron redox reactions of polyanionic cathode materials for sustainable CIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance p&#8208;Type 1D Van der Waals Electronics Prepared Through Solution Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance p&#8208;type transistors are realized via solution&#8208;processed van der Waals tellurium nanowires, exhibiting excellent mobility and scalability. The negligible mobility degradation at Te&#8208;Te junctions enables large&#8208;area films with remarkable device performance, advancing low&#8208;cost electronics.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based methods have emerged as a promising approach for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electronics fabrication. However, solution processing has rarely realized high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type transistors, impeding the advancement of solution&#8208;processed electronics. Among the various solution&#8208;processable material families, van der Waals (vdW) systems stand out due to several attractive features, one of which is the atomically defined interfaces that facilitate carrier charge transport, enabling enhanced device performance. Here, the preparation of transistors based on single tellurium (Te) nanowires (NW) is demonstrated, achieving high mobilities averaging &#8776;370 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Notably, subsequent studies reveal that devices based on Te&#8208;Te NW junctions exhibit mobilities comparable to those of the individual NWs forming the junction. This indicates that the vdW contact between the Te NWs causes negligible degradation in the mobility, which aligns with the theoretical calculations. Based on this finding, a large&#8208;area 1D Te NWs vdW film is further prepared, consisting of a large number of 1D Te NWs interconnected by vdW junctions. The resulting transistors can still maintain remarkable operating characteristics, including an average field&#8208;effect hole mobility of &#8776;94.9 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, a subthreshold swing of &#8776;248.6 mVdec&#8722;1, a current on/off ratio of &#8776;104, and a low operating voltage of 1&#160;V.

         <title>&#8220;Rigid&#8208;Flexible&#8221; Strategy Realizes Robust Ultralong Phosphorescence for Multifunctional Display Unit and Photoreceptor Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous phosphorescent polymer is realized with a narrow band, long lifetime, and high efficiency by introducing a planar chromophore BCz into polymer PVB through a rigid&#8208;flexible approach. The film has a phosphorescence lifetime of 4.71 s, a phosphorescence efficiency of 42.1%, and a FWHM of 24 nm. Surprisingly, the films exhibit unique photoactivation properties and good environmental stability, enabling storage in high humidity environments for extended periods of time and even in aqueous environments. Full&#8208;color stable phosphorescence emission is achieved through a triplet&#8208;FRET strategy and applied to luminescent displays, 3D printing, and simulation of photoreceptor synapses.








Abstract
Amorphous materials are highly attractive for the development of ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) due to their ease of processing, scalability, and flexibility. However, the realization of stable URTP polymers remains a great challenge. Here, it is reported a robust and flexible approach to realize high&#8208;quality URTP polymers by doping the organic phosphor into the polymer matrix with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. This unique structure enables double confinement of the triplet exciton of phosphor, resulting in ultra&#8208;bright amorphous URTP films. URTP films exhibit narrow&#8208;band emission, ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence lifetime, ultra&#8208;high phosphorescence efficiency, and distinctive photoactivation properties, with intense phosphorescence emission observable even in daylight. Furthermore, it is demonstrated color&#8208;tunable emission through f&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and explores its potential applications in 3D printing, patterned displays, and bionic photoreceptor synapses. The work provides valuable insights into the design of robust, high&#8208;quality phosphorescent materials, which could pave the way for a wide range of applications in display and bionic technologies.

         <title>Super Stable Moisture&#8208;Responsive Actuator via Covalent Crosslinking for Efficient Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents highly stable moisture&#8208;responsive textiles for personal thermal management. Citric acid&#8208;crosslinked bacterial cellulose smart textile retains performance through 200 humidity cycles and 100 washing cycles&#8212;enhancing washing stability by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. The textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% (even 186.2% at 12 km h&#8722;1 wind) and lowers skin temperature by &#8776;1.96&#160;&#176;C during exercise.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;responsive actuators exhibit significant potential for applications in personal thermal management. However, their cyclic stability, particularly under washing conditions, remains a critical challenge. In this study, moisture&#8208;responsive actuators are developed composed of bacterial cellulose chemically crosslinked with citric acid for use in moisture&#8208;responsive textiles. Simulation results demonstrate that the covalent cross&#8208;linking network effectively stabilizes the microstructure of the material, thereby preserving its moisture&#8208;responsive performance after 200 humidity cycles and 100 washing cycles. Compared to previously reported materials, the washing stability has been enhanced by approximately one to two orders of magnitude without compromise in thermal management performance. Relative to conventional textiles, the engineered smart textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% and achieves an outstanding 186.2% improvement at a wind speed of 12&#160;km h&#8722;1. Furthermore, it reduces skin temperature by approximately 1.96&#160;&#176;C during strenuous physical activity, showcasing superior moisture regulation and heat dissipation capabilities. This research presents a robust methodology for enhancing the durability of functional textiles, thereby promoting their broader application in personal thermal management systems.

Relative to conventional textiles, the engineered smart textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% and achieves an outstanding 186.2% improvement at a wind speed of 12&#160;km h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, it reduces skin temperature by approximately 1.96&#160;&#176;C during strenuous physical activity, showcasing superior moisture regulation and heat dissipation capabilities. This research presents a robust methodology for enhancing the durability of functional textiles, thereby promoting their broader application in personal thermal management systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Lewis Acid Effect in the Pores of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Host for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents AlFx@MIL&#8208;101, a 3D MOF&#8208;based host for lithium metal anodes. The unsaturated AlFx with strong Lewis acidity can fix anions and solvents, enhancing Li+ dissociation, desolvation, and transport while reducing concentration polarization. The 3D AlFx@MIL&#8208;101 host suppresses electrode expansion, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and stripping during cycling in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The homogeneous introduction of Lewis acid sites into 3D hosts of Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial for promoting Li+ dissociation and desolvation. Herein, the use of MIL&#8208;101, a well&#8208;known flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, loaded with uniformly distributed AlFx species with unsaturated Lewis acid sites, is proposed as a Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) 3D host to promote Li+ dissociation and desolvation in LMBs. A symmetrical cell using an AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu with pre&#8208;deposited lithium (Li@AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu) exhibits stable performance for over 3600 h. In addition, a high&#8208;loading LFP||Li@AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu full cell maintains high capacity after 4000 cycles at 1 C with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.87%. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the AlFx species with strong Lewis acidity and MIL&#8208;101 with nanospace confinement effect promote Li+ dissociation and desolvation coupled with fast and uniform Li+ transport. The MIL&#8208;101 pores accommodate Li species, thereby inhibiting volume changes in the LMA. These results demonstrate that AlFx@MIL&#8208;101 ensures uniform and dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on LMAs, making it a promising host for high&#8208;stability LMBs.

         <title>K&#8208;Edge&#8208;Inspired Selenomelanin Hydrogel: An X&#8208;Ray Filtering Biomaterial for Skin Protection in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by developing an X&#8208;ray filtering hydrogel, achieving skin protection in radiotherapy. The hydrogel exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray harm to skin through the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge in SeMNPs, while maintaining over 98% transmission for therapeutic photons.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely employed in cancer treatment, yet its inevitable side effects, particularly radiation dermatitis (RD), remain a significant concern. Numerous studies focus on alleviating RD symptoms, but approaches to minimize the radiation dose to the skin are underexplored. Shielding skin&#8208;damaging photons (10&#8211;20 keV) holds promise for skin dose reduction; however, this strategy is hindered by inadequate shielding efficiency of current RD biomaterials and overshielding by conventional high&#8208;Z materials which attenuate therapeutic high&#8208;energy photons. Here, inspired by the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge, an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by integrating selenium&#8208;containing melanin nanoparticles with a carbomer hydrogel is proposed, developing an X&#8208;ray filtering skin dressing (SeMNPs@Car). It exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray (10&#8211;20 keV) while maintaining over 98% transmission for high&#8208;energy photons. In RD animal models, the SeMNPs@Car achieves 100% prevention of ulceration and the longest delay in the onset of RD (&#8776;20 days), outperforming clinical RD treatments. Furthermore, Monte&#8208;Carlo&#8208;based reconstruction of radiotherapy scenarios demonstrates its clinical applicability. This work incorporates photoelectric absorption properties into hydrogel design, providing valuable insights for RD management and the creation of soft&#8208;material&#8208;based X&#8208;ray filters.

Through a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy employing structural motif engineering, ultra&#8208;low&#8208;symmetry Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers featuring unprecedented 20.1&#160;&#197;&#8208;long [Ta4Pt2Se14] motifs were discovered. This extended motif architecture enables exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, confirmed by direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. Notably, the bandgap&#8208;independent photoresponse of 2D Ta2PtSe7 achieves 27 V/W at 10.6 &#181;m while maintaining &gt;70% of its initial photocurrent throughout 50 bending cycles.








Abstract
The limited ability of traditional 2D anisotropic materials to meet next&#8208;generation anisotropic device demands necessitates innovative design strategies. To address this challenge, a symmetry&#8208;reduction approach is proposed that enhances in&#8208;plane anisotropy by extending structural motifs to lower crystal symmetry. Implementing this design principle, a novel van der Waals material, Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers is successfully developed, featuring record&#8208;breaking [Ta4Pt2Se14] structural motifs with an unprecedented length of 20.1 &#197;. This unique architecture endows Ta2PtSe7 with remarkable intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, manifesting in strongly direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. The developed Ta2PtSe7&#8208;based photodetector demonstrates exceptional broadband responsiveness across an expansive spectral range from visible to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR; 671 nm&#8211;10.6 &#181;m). Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance under low operating voltage (0.1 V), achieving a high responsivity of 27 V&#160;W&#8722;1 at 10.6 &#181;m illumination &#8211; a significant advancement in LWIR detection capabilities. Furthermore, flexible device configurations exhibit excellent mechanical robustness, maintaining over 70% of initial photocurrent after 50 bending cycles, demonstrating promising potential for flexible optoelectronics. This study proposes a novel structural motif engineering strategy to design anisotropic materials, exemplified by Ta2PtSe7&#8217;s exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, broadband photoresponse, and mechanical robustness, enabling high&#8208;performance anisotropic optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Modulating Single&#8208;Atom Pt Coordination for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1) is discovered with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to commercial Pt/C. It is shown that modulating the coordination environment of Pt single atoms is crucial towards dictating the electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional capability of Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1&#160;is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can be used for the on&#8208;demand generation of clean electricity. However, such systems have low efficiency due to the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Prior reports have largely focused on Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts, however, their high cost motivates the need for simultaneously increasing activity whilst reducing the metal loading. Here, the design of a bifunctional Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is reported, with enhanced catalytic activities compared to commercial Pt/C for both reactions. Notably, by modulating the Pt SAC coordination, the optimal catalyst (Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1) displayed a high AOR mass activity of 1.23 A mgPt&#8722;1 and ORR mass activity of 7.98 A mgPt&#8722;1. This is then integrated into a DAFC as both the cathode and anode, achieving a peak power density of 21.8 mW cm&#8722;2 and low Pt mass loading of only 0.034 mg cm&#8722;2. In situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments on Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1 indicate a lower *OH coverage under ORR conditions and suppressed formation of poisoning species *NOx under AOR conditions as additional reasons for its enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity. Importantly, the study demonstrates how SACs can be rationally designed for DAFC electrocatalysis.

     alt="Modulating Single-Atom Pt Coordination for Enhanced Low-Temperature Ammonia Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bifunctional Pt single-atom catalyst (Pt-DG-1) is discovered with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to commercial Pt/C. It is shown that modulating the coordination environment of Pt single atoms is crucial towards dictating the electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional capability of Pt-DG-1&#160;is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can be used for the on-demand generation of clean electricity. However, such systems have low efficiency due to the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Prior reports have largely focused on Pt-based electrocatalysts, however, their high cost motivates the need for simultaneously increasing activity whilst reducing the metal loading. Here, the design of a bifunctional Pt single-atom catalyst (SAC) is reported, with enhanced catalytic activities compared to commercial Pt/C for both reactions. Notably, by modulating the Pt SAC coordination, the optimal catalyst (Pt-DG-1) displayed a high AOR mass activity of 1.23 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ORR mass activity of 7.98 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is then integrated into a DAFC as both the cathode and anode, achieving a peak power density of 21.8 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low Pt mass loading of only 0.034 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments on Pt-DG-1 indicate a lower &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OH coverage under ORR conditions and suppressed formation of poisoning species &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; under AOR conditions as additional reasons for its enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity. Importantly, the study demonstrates how SACs can be rationally designed for DAFC electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Electrolysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Saline Wastewater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated EE&#8208;PR process is developed using a ZrN/CF electrode and AEM flow cell. This system enables rapid, selective, and scalable recovery of uranium from saline nuclear wastewater, offering a low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional solvent&#8208;based extraction methods.








Abstract
Recovery of uranium from residual spent fuel dissolution liquor in nuclear power plants is economically and environmentally desirable. While electrochemical extraction offers a greener alternative to solvent&#8208;based methods like the PUREX (plutonium uranium reduction extraction) process, it has been limited to batch processing of non&#8208;saline waters. Here, a high&#8208;performance ZrN/copper foam (ZrN/CF) electrode is presented that enables a continuous electroextraction&#8208;purification&#8208;reuse (EE&#8208;PR) process, achieving &gt;98% pure UO2 directly from saline wastewater for direct reuse as nuclear fuel. An anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) flow cell for uranium extraction is introduced, integrating it with a ZrN/CF electrode to achieve complete uranium removal within two hours &#8211; an unprecedented efficiency in marine environments. Scalability assessments and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm the environmental and economic feasibility of this approach, with the estimated total cost for extracting uranium comparable to the current market price. As the global adoption of nuclear energy accelerates, this process offers a transformative solution for sustainable uranium recovery and resource management.

         <title>Expanding the Particle Range for Biocatalytically Active Pickering Emulsions with Silicone Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pickering emulsions are a promising class of reaction systems for biocatalysis. However, only a few materials can stabilize the required w/o emulsion. In this study, it is demonstrated that coating microparticles with modified silicone is a straightforward, versatile, and tunable method for producing appropriate particles. Consequently, enzyme carriers can be employed as emulsion stabilizers and immobilization materials, thereby intensifying reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Pickering emulsions (PEs) are a particularly promising class of reaction systems for biocatalysis, typically in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (w/o) configuration, with a continuous organic phase and a dispersed aqueous phase containing the biocatalyst. However, only a few micro&#8208; and nanoparticles possess the intrinsic hydrophobicity necessary to stabilize such a w/o PE, which limits the application prospects. Here, silicone coatings are applied to prepare micro particles for w/o PE stabilization for the first time. The study demonstrates compatibility with available inorganic and organic materials, and the effects of silicone coatings with overall hydrophilic, amphiphilic, or hydrophobic properties on the particle size, PE formation, and the stability of the PE. Furthermore, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed transesterification in PE obtained with silicone&#8208;coated particles is performed, and the possibility to place the catalyst not only in the dispersed phase of the PE, but also on the stabilizing particles prior to coating is demonstrated. The results indicate silicone coatings as a straightforward, versatile, and tunable method for the preparation of particles with suitable properties for both the stabilization of BioPE and the immobilization of active biocatalysts.

         <title>Over 20% Efficient Water&#8208;Based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with High Thickness Tolerance Enabled by Surfactant Promoted Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;engineered donor nanoparticles using doubly anionic surfactant SDP enhance electrostatic contrast, optimizing vertical morphology in thick films (300&#8211;400 nm). Water&#8208;based donor inks and non&#8208;halogenated processing enable eco&#8208;friendly fabrication. Devices achieve record efficiencies: 18.9% for binary (300 nm) and 20.3% for ternary systems, respectively, demonstrating unprecedented thickness tolerance and industrial potential.








Abstract
Aqueous processing represents a promising eco&#8208;friendly fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), aligning with growing industrial sustainability requirements. While water&#8208;dispersed semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) offer an attractive solution, the essential surfactants required for NP stabilization typically compromise device performance. In this study, surfactant&#8208;engineered donor NPs are systematically evaluated for constructing optimized active layers through a sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition approach. The surfactant named sodium dodecyl phosphate (SDP), featuring dual anionic charges, generates exceptional electrostatic potential (ESP) differences that promote strong donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. This electrostatic engineering enables the formation of a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction structure (PPHJ) with ideal vertically graded morphologies in thick active layers. Therefore, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO binary OSC processed by mesostructured NP (mn)&#8208;LBL (SDP) strategy shows excellent thickness tolerance and achieved a PCE of 18.9% (certified as 18.3%) with a 300 nm active layer. Furthermore, the mn&#8208;LBL OSCs with the ternary PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 deliver a champion PCE of 20.3% (certified as 19.9%) processed by a non&#8208;halogenated water/toluene solvent system. This work establishes a general surfactant selection paradigm that simultaneously addresses the conflicting demands of nanoparticle stabilization, morphological control, and device performance, paving the way for sustainable manufacturing of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Laser&#8208;Induced Graphitization Enabling Current Collector&#8208;Free Electrodes With Spatially Tunable Iron/Iron Oxide Phases</title>

Iron&#8208;catalyzed laser&#8208;induced graphitization (IC&#8208;LIG)&#160;enables the eco&#8208;efficient fabrication of current collector&#8208;free carbon electrodes on renewable substrates,&#160;outperforming traditional methods. Tunable ink rheology supports spray coating, screen printing, and DIW of complex patterns, while laser post&#8208;treatment allows spatial control of iron phases. Graphitic structures support redox&#8208;active phases, enabling stable performance, offering a sustainable platform for future electrochemical devices and beyond.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed laser&#8208;induced graphitization (IC&#8208;LIG) represents an eco&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional carbon electrode manufacturing. Combining a bio&#8208;based tannic acid&#8211;iron precursor ink with CO2 laser treatment results in sheet resistance of 23.59&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#937;&#160;&#9633;&#8722;1 on renewable substrates. Varying the tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;to&#8208;iron ratio (TA:Fe), the rheology of the precursor ink can be tuned, enabling versatile application techniques, including spray coating, screen printing, and direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW). Subsequent laser&#8208;treatment enables the formation of functional IC&#8208;LIG electrodes for all application methods, while even thick DIW&#8208;printed layers (260&#160;&#181;m) result in complex, conductive electrode patterns. Laser post&#8208;treatment expands design possibilities by locally tuning iron phases, such as converting &#947;&#8208;iron to magnetite. The unidirectional laser&#8208;treatment results in a layered arrangement, forming a multilayer electrode with a highly graphitized top layer serving as a current collector substitute, and an underlying composite of iron&#8208;rich nanoparticles embedded in a porous graphitic foam, acting as a hybrid electrode. Electrochemical analysis reveals double&#8208;layer capacitor behavior at low TA:Fe ratios, while higher ratios demonstrate increased redox activity and pseudo&#8208;capacitive characteristics. Achieving stable capacities of 15&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a 1&#160;M NaCl electrolyte over 5000 cycles underscores the potential of IC&#8208;LIG electrodes as a sustainable solution for advanced energy storage devices and beyond.

The unidirectional laser-treatment results in a layered arrangement, forming a multilayer electrode with a highly graphitized top layer serving as a current collector substitute, and an underlying composite of iron-rich nanoparticles embedded in a porous graphitic foam, acting as a hybrid electrode. Electrochemical analysis reveals double-layer capacitor behavior at low TA:Fe ratios, while higher ratios demonstrate increased redox activity and pseudo-capacitive characteristics. Achieving stable capacities of 15&#160;mF&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a 1&#160;M NaCl electrolyte over 5000 cycles underscores the potential of IC-LIG electrodes as a sustainable solution for advanced energy storage devices and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Ligand&#8208;Dominated Redox Activity in &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>

Through precise d&#8208;orbital optimization, a novel Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer, Ni&#8208;BTA, is synthesized for potassium&#8208;ion battery anodes. The engineered electronic structure, featuring strong Ni2&#8314;&#8211;ligand &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, enhances the stability of the organic framework by strengthening C&#9552;N bonds. This structural reinforcement enables highly reversible electrochemical processes and contributes to the material's exceptional cycling performance and high capacity.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) offer a cost&#8208;effective, resource&#8208;abundant alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet the development of high&#8208;performance anodes with adequate capacity, stability, and rate capability remains a major challenge. Here, an electronic structure engineering strategy is introduced via d&#8208;orbital configuration optimization in a novel class of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated coordination polymers (TM&#8208;BTA, TM = Ni, Co, Mn). Orbital&#8208;level and charge density analyses reveal that the metal center's electronic configuration governs metal&#8211;ligand interaction strength, thereby modulating charge delocalization and ligand redox behavior. Among the series, Ni2&#8314; exhibits the strongest &#960;&#8211;d conjugation with nitrogen donor atoms, stabilizing C&#9552;N bonds and enabling highly reversible C&#9552;N/C&#9472;N transformations as the dominant redox process. This optimized coordination lowers the K&#8314; adsorption energy barrier by 44% compared to Co2&#8314; and Mn2&#8314;, markedly improving kinetics. As a result, Ni&#8208;BTA delivers a high reversible capacity of 452&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 99.2% retention over 500 cycles at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and maintains 292&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4,000 cycles at 1,000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a ligand&#8208;centered three&#8208;electron redox mechanism, where nitrogen heterocycles dominate K&#8314; storage and electrochemically inert Ni centers maintain structural integrity. This work establishes a general design principle for KIB anodes via d&#8208;orbital engineering in coordination polymers.

         <title>Non&#8208;Drying Hydrogel Polyelectrolytes via Polymer&#8208;Assisted Cation Solvation&#8208;Confinement Toward H2O for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is reported to create non&#8208;drying poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) polyelectrolytes, enabling aqueous symmetric micro&#8208;supercapacitors with a record&#8208;breaking 2.5&#160;V voltage and unprecedented areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogel electrolytes often encounter challenges such as poor water retention and a limited electrochemical window due to inadequate control over water molecules, leading to a low operational voltage and an undesirable low energy density of pure aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs). Herein, a polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is presented to enhance both water retention and the electrochemical window of poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PAM&#8208;HPA) polyelectrolytes. Remarkably, PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes, without any organic additives, exhibit no water evaporation after over 3.5 months of air exposure at room temperature. Owing to the strong confinement toward H2O in PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolyte, activated carbon&#8208;based aqueous symmetric MSCs achieve a record&#8208;breaking voltage of 2.5&#160;V and the highest areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2 among all reported pure aqueous carbon&#8208;based MSCs. Even coupling with low&#8208;voltage MXene&#8208;based microelectrodes, the microdevice still maintains a high voltage exceeding 2&#160;V, a significant areal energy density, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life. Impressively, after exposing PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes to an oven at 60&#160;&#176;C for 24 h, the constructed MSCs retain nearly 90% of their capacitance compared to non&#8208;heat&#8208;treated polyelectrolytes. This work introduces a novel approach for developing non&#8208;drying polyelectrolytes with a wide electrochemical window, boosting the development of high&#8208;performance and safe micro&#8208;power sources.

         <title>Harnessing Rapid Li+/H&#948;+ Exchange within the Electric Double Layer for High Performance Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and lithium &#8208; ions (Li+) exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive coordination with the solvent oxygen sites. The electric double layer&#8208;governed Li+/H&#948;+ exchange substantially promotes interfacial Li&#8314; de&#8208;solvation to suppress graphite exfoliation and contributes to an expanded oxidation stability window of the electrolyte.








Abstract
The electric double layer (EDL) plays a pivotal role in governing interfacial composition and electrode behavior in electrochemical systems. However, the intricate relationship between EDL architectures and electrochemical processes remains elusive. Here the fundamental significance of hydrogen bond polarity within the EDL in orchestrating the interfacial lithium&#8208;ions (Li+) exchange dynamics is elucidated. At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and Li+ ions exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive effect for the solvent oxygen sites, which modulates the de&#8208;solvation process and ultimately impacts battery performance. Based on this, a solvent&#8208;centered de&#8208;solvation mechanism is proposed, wherein the microenvironment with enhanced hydrogen polarity in the EDL facilitates solvent displacement from Li+ coordination shells. Furthermore, the presence of polar hydrogen at charged cathode interface can effectively anchor uncoordinated solvents molecules, increasing the energy barrier for detrimental dehydrogenation reaction. As a result, electrolytes design based on this strategy enables remarkable electrochemical stability, achieving over 2000 cycles in a 5&#160;V dual&#8208;ion battery. In addition, the Gr||NCM811 pouch cell exhibits exceptional longevity, retaining 90.2% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Glass Composite Fiber for Broadband NIR&#8208;II Mini Light Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2+ activated glass composites and corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared by rational control of nanocrystallization, achieving efficient broadband response and on&#8208;off gain in NIR&#8208;II region. In addition, an all&#8208;fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is further constructed and demonstrated its promising applications for NIR&#8208;II imaging.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared second window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) light sources present remarkable scientific and technological promise, with wide&#8208;ranging applications spanning biomedical imaging, biosensing, and related fields. However, most of the available candidates are in bulk form and it is urgently required to develop mini light sources. Herein, a broadband NIR&#8208;II mini fiber&#8208;type light source equipped by Ni2+ activated glass composite fibers is proposed and investigated. It is shown that the transparent glass composite exhibits broadband NIR&#8208;II emission with a full width half&#8208;maximum approaching 240 nm and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) larger than 50% by rational control of nanocrystallization. Additionally, the corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared, demonstrating&#160;efficient broadband response and distinct on&#8208;off gain in NIR&#8208;II region. Benefited from above features, an all&#8208;fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is successfully constructed and demonstrates its promising applications for NIR&#8208;II imaging. These findings demonstrate significant progress in the development of NIR&#8208;responsive photonic materials, enabling advanced applications in photonic technology.

     alt="Glass Composite Fiber for Broadband NIR-II Mini Light Source"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated glass composites and corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared by rational control of nanocrystallization, achieving efficient broadband response and on-off gain in NIR-II region. In addition, an all-fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is further constructed and demonstrated its promising applications for NIR-II imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared second window (NIR-II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) light sources present remarkable scientific and technological promise, with wide-ranging applications spanning biomedical imaging, biosensing, and related fields. However, most of the available candidates are in bulk form and it is urgently required to develop mini light sources. Herein, a broadband NIR-II mini fiber-type light source equipped by Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated glass composite fibers is proposed and investigated. It is shown that the transparent glass composite exhibits broadband NIR-II emission with a full width half-maximum approaching 240 nm and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) larger than 50% by rational control of nanocrystallization. Additionally, the corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared, demonstrating&#160;efficient broadband response and distinct on-off gain in NIR-II region. Benefited from above features, an all-fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is successfully constructed and demonstrates its promising applications for NIR-II imaging. These findings demonstrate significant progress in the development of NIR-responsive photonic materials, enabling advanced applications in photonic technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable, Adhesive, Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel Electrolytes with Dual&#8208;Functional Water Regulation Enabled by Amide Group&#8211;Salt&#8211;Water Interactions for All&#8208;Climate Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is constructed via a one&#8208;pot strategy, integrating acetate anions and the hydrophilic amide groups on polyacrylamide chains. This design disrupts the intrinsic water hydrogen&#8208;bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries to operate over a broad temperature range spanning from &#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and environmental compatibility. However, parasitic reactions induced by active water molecules in conventional aqueous electrolytes severely degrade electrochemical performance and cycling stability. Herein, a stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is synthesized via a one&#8208;pot radical polymerization strategy, where acetate (Ac&#8722;) anions and hydrophilic amide (&#9472;CONH2) groups on polyacrylamide (PAM) chains synergistically regulate water activity. This design disrupts water's intrinsic hydrogen bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling stable AZIBs operation across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). Consequently, Zn||Cu cells employing PAM&#8208;Zn(Ac)2&#8208;4KAc (denoted PAM&#8208;ZnK4Ac) hydrogel electrolyte achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 500 cycles, demonstrating outstanding reversibility. Meanwhile, Zn||polyaniline (PANI) cells retain 81.4% capacity after 1100 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C and operate effectively up to 100 &#176;C. This work establishes a facile yet effective strategy for preparing hydrogel electrolytes, advancing all&#8208;climate AZIBs toward extreme&#8208;environment energy storage and flexible electronics.

         <title>A Hydro&#8208;Expansive and Degradable Biomaterial Enabling Shape Recovery of Film&#8208;Based Devices in Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chitosan&#8208;based bio&#8208;composite exhibits stable and strong tensile strength during volumetric expansion in body fluids, serving as a functional coating that enables a thin film&#8208;based device to self&#8208;flatten from its tubular shape required for catheter delivery. The material naturally degrades after deployment, demonstrating a promising strategy for the minimally invasive implantation of flexible, film&#8208;based medical devices.








Abstract
Hygroscopic actuation is an important material function, which enables a broad range of applications such as self&#8208;healing devices, soft robotics, and catheter implantation. With the current paradigm of implantable devices shifting toward soft and tissue&#8208;mimicking systems, this function however, is particularly weak in soft&#8208; and bio&#8208;materials due to the rapid loss of intermolecular interactions upon water incorporation. Here, a chitosan&#8208;based bio&#8208;composite is developed, which sustains the intermolecular repulsive force during water absorption through synergistic effects of hydrogen bonding, plasticization, and nano&#8208;confinement. When interact with body fluids, this material provides a stable and strong tensile force throughout its volume expansion process. Therefore, it serves as a functional coating that self&#8208;flattens a thin film&#8208;based device which holds a tubular shape needed for catheter delivery, and then degrades naturally. This capability is further demonstrated in vivo using a rolled triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for intracardiac implantation. The TENG device recovers its original shape after being placed inside the heart left ventricle and restores its regular energy harvesting function, evidencing the feasibility for minimally invasive implantation of flexible film&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Magnetocrystalline Anisotropic Platinum&#8211;Palladium&#8211;Iron Ternary Intermetallic Alloy for Enhanced Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, how crystallographic anisotropy governs the catalytic process is investigated by comparing the tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 ordered phases in a newly developed PtPdFe ternary intermetallic system. New insights into the fundamental understanding of the ordered Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic alloys are introduced, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis in fuel cells.








Abstract
Ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic alloys have emerged as promising candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in comparison to their disordered counterparts. Here, novel ferromagnetic PtPdFe ternary intermetallic alloys with structurally ordered tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 phases are presented, featuring distinctive characteristics in crystal structures and atomic alignments. Insights into the fundamental understanding of the Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic catalysts are provided, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for ORR catalysis. Electrochemical half&#8208; and single&#8208;cell assessments reveal that the L10&#8208;PtPdFe intermetallic catalysts exhibit superior ORR performance compared to their L12&#8208;type counterparts. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the unique tetragonal structure of L10&#8208;PtPdFe, characterized by strong 5d&#8211;3d orbital interactions along the c&#8208;axis direction, induces ferromagnetic ordering and leads to increased magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, thereby accelerating the ORR process. The fuel cell fabricated by such a cathode catalyst retains its performance after prolonged degradation test, meeting the 2025 stability goals set by the US Department of Energy under H2&#8211;O2, H2&#8211;air, and H2&#8211;N2 conditions. These new conceptual findings establish a rational framework for designing high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based intermetallic electrocatalysts, where magnetic anisotropy arising from ferromagnetic ordering can be harnessed to tailor catalytic performance for next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>High Ionic Seebeck Effect in Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a role of natural leaves as thermoelectric biomaterials, capable of converting heat into electricity through the ionic Seebeck effect. The leaves exhibit significant and reproducible thermopower under both moderate temperature gradients and photothermal conditions. These findings open avenues for developing eco&#8208;friendly energy conversion systems and biotechnologies based on in vivo thermoelectric assay.








Abstract
Plants actively transport ions to sustain life, yet their capacity to convert heat to electricity via the ionic Seebeck effect has remained unexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that natural Ficus elastica leaves can generate ionic thermovoltages up to 7 V under mild temperature gradients, achieving a high ionic figure of merit of &#8764;5.6 at room temperature. This pronounced thermoelectric response arises from anion thermodiffusion through the apoplast and is significantly amplified by leaf desiccation and electrode selection. A dielectric capacitive model accounts for the observed enhancement. Notably, living leaves generate thermopower under light&#8208;induced temperature gradients, underscoring the potential of in vivo ionic thermoelectric assays. These findings reveal an unrecognized energy&#8208;harvesting function in plant tissue and introduce a biodegradable platform for sustainable thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion.

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Ultrathin Black Phosphorus Nanodisks Hybridized with Fe3O4 Nanoclusters and Iron (V)&#8208;Oxo Complex for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>

Ultrathin black phosphorus nanodisks hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoclusters and iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex are rationally synthesized, and shown to exhibit ultrahigh stability in humid air, and competitive electrochemical potassium storage properties benefiting from unique structural and compositional merits.








Abstract
The practical&#160;application of metalloid black phosphorus (BP) based anodes for potassium ion batteries is mainly impeded by its instability in air and irreversible/sluggish potassium storage behaviors. Herein, a 2D composite is purposefully conceptualized, where ultrathin BP nanodisks with Fe3O4 nanoclusters are hybridized with Lewis acid iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex (FC) nanosheets (denoted as BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC). The introduced electron coordinate bridge between FC and BP, and hydrophobic surface of FC synergistically assure that BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC is ultrastable in humid air. With the purposeful structural and componential design, the resultant BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC anode is endowed with appealing electrochemical performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate behavior, and long&#8208;duration cycling stability in both half and full cells. Furthermore, the underlying formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms of BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC are tentatively proposed. The in&#8208;depth insights here will provide a crucial understanding in rational exploration of advanced anodes for next&#8208;generation PIBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Mn/Fe Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Electroreduction and Sustainable Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports adjacent N, P&#8208;coordinated Mn/Fe dual single&#8208;atom sites supported on hollow carbon polyhedron (MnFe&#8208;PNC) for superior ORR catalysis and the application of high&#8208;rate and wide&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;air batteries. The integration Fe&#8208;N3P with Mn&#8208;N3P coordination structures displays atomic distance&#8208;dependent electronic effects in optimizing the adsorption strength of *OH intermediate.








Abstract
Conquering the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significantly important for sustainable metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the synthesis of advanced Pt&#8208;free ORR electrocatalysts still remains challenging owing to the intrinsic activity, site accessibility, and structural stability. Herein, a catalyst of asymmetric N, P&#8208;coordinated Mn and Fe dual single atoms supported on hollow carbon polyhedra (MnFe&#8208;PNC) is synthesized via a metal&#8208;organic framework pyrolysis strategy, which displays excellent pH&#8208;universal ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.923&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m KOH, 0.803&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m HClO4, and 0.774&#160;V in 1&#160;m phosphate buffer solution. Theoretical calculations reveal that the distance&#8208;dependent electronic interaction between Mn&#8208;N3P and Fe&#8208;N3P structures at the atomic level plays a crucial role in optimizing the adsorption strength of *OH intermediate and consequently boosts ORR performance. Furthermore, the aqueous Zn/Al&#8208;air batteries using MnFe&#8208;PNC cathode catalyst show ultralong discharge stability and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. Meanwhile, combined with an anti&#8208;freezing and zincophilic organohydrogel electrolyte, the MnFe&#8208;PNC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries exhibit robust cycling stability (130&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 70&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), an unprecedented discharge capacity of 1.30 Ah at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, and smooth operation over a broad temperature range of &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Thrombin&#8208;Anchored Bacterial Cellulose Dressing for Advanced Burn Wound Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thrombin&#8208;anchored bacterial cellulose (T&#8208;BC) dressing is developed to address hemorrhage during burn surgery. By integrating a recombinant thrombin&#8211;cellulose&#8208;binding domain&#160;fusion protein into the BC matrix, the dressing achieves rapid hemostasis and enhanced wound healing. Validated in simulated deep partial&#8208;thickness burn models, this biocompatible material presents a promising therapeutic platform for advanced burn wound management.








Abstract
In burn wound surgery, commercially available dressings often lack the necessary hemostatic properties required to effectively manage hemorrhage during critical procedures, such as tangential excision of eschar. To address this limitation, a thrombin&#8208;anchored bacterial cellulose (T&#8208;BC) dressing is developed that combines the biocompatibility of bacterial cellulose (BC) with the hemostatic efficacy of a recombinant thrombin&#8208;cellulose binding domain (CBD) fusion protein. The CBD facilitates stable thrombin anchoring within the BC matrix, enhancing hemostasis, and promoting wound healing. The recombinant thrombin retains enzymatic activity comparable to human thrombin, enabling rapid hemostasis in rat liver models within 60 s. Extensive testing across cellular, blood, and rat models has substantiated the dressing's exceptional biocompatibility, potent bleeding control, and accelerated wound repair, particularly in deep partial&#8208;thickness burn wound models. By seamlessly integrating thrombin into the BC matrix, the T&#8208;BC dressing offers an innovative and effective solution for burn wound care, significantly improving both healing speed and clinical outcomes.

         <title>Transparent&#8208;To&#8208;Reflective Multicolor All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Next&#8208;Generation Intelligent Display Windows</title>

Based on the challenge that it is difficult to construct a resonant cavity in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices to achieve multiple color changes, a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode is utilized to realize multiple color changes in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device based on WO3, achieving a wide color gamut of up to 11.58%.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices have a wide range of industrial applications due to favorable chemical stability, high optical modulation rate, and good process compatibility. However, the monochromatic nature evidently restricts its development in transparent display, especially in application scenarios where color display is required. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state WO3&#8208;based electrochromic device is presented with a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode, which features a transparent&#8208;to&#8208;reflective switching mode. More importantly, through the optimization of optical interference, the device exhibits rainbow structural colors. Leveraging the tunable optical constants of the electrochromic layer in conjunction with the additive color mixing principle, a remarkably wide color gamut of up to 11.58% can be attained with merely a minimal bias voltage of &#177;1.5 V, which substantially broadens the color gamut boundary of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ECDs and represents a significant breakthrough in color&#8208;rendering capabilities. The device exhibits excellent electrochromic performance, remarkable cycling stability (at least 5600 cycles), low power consumption (3.8 mW cm&#8722;2). Moreover, this device has two different performance modes, namely transmittance and reflection, and it holds great application potential in fields such as advertising, information transmission, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Tuning Spin Polarization of Iron in Oxides to Boost Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic NRR for ammonia production offers potential energy savings and environmental benefits. However, most effective catalysts use expensive noble metals. This study explores how spin polarization in iron oxides influences NRR performance. it is found that iron in perovskite boosts ammonia yield by 79 times compared to Fe2O3, offering a promising path for sustainable ammonia production.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production has gained attention for its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. However, effective NRR catalysts currently rely on expensive noble metals, the development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal alternatives remains highly challenging. Iron&#8208;based catalysts are underexplored because of their inherently low reactivity. In this study, it is found that tailoring spin polarization, specifically the occupation state of electronics on d orbital in iron oxides, can highly boost NRR performance with carefully designed spin polarization. Iron in perovskite SrFeO3 with higher spin polarization shows 79 times increase in ammonia yield compared to iron in Fe2O3. This improvement is accompanied with 9 times increase in charge transfer between iron and *NNH, the rate&#8208;determining step of NRR manipulating the spin polarization of transition metals can lead to efficient catalysts for electrochemical NRR, offering valuable insights for enhancing catalyst performance and enabling more sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Nanometer Resolution Structure&#8208;Emission Correlation of Individual Quantum Emitters via Enhanced Cathodoluminescence in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanometer&#8208;resolution mapping of individual quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride is achieved, allowing us to identify the 440&#160;nm blue emitter as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Leveraging this atomic&#8208;level insight, the deterministic creation of isolated single 440&#160;nm blue emitters is demonstrated through localized electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride.








Abstract
Understanding the atomic structure of quantum emitters, often originating from point defects or impuritie, is essential for designing and optimizing materials for quantum technologies such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Despite the availability of atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale cathodoluminescence microscopy, experimentally determining the atomic structure of individual emitters is challenging due to the conflicting needs for thick samples to generate strong cathodoluminescence signals and thin samples for structural analysis. To overcome this challenge, significantly enhanced cathodoluminescence at twisted interfaces is leveraged to achieve sub&#8208;nanometer localization precision for the first time in mapping individual quantum emitters in carbon&#8208;implanted hexagonal boron nitride. This unprecedent spatial sensitivity, together with correlative electron energy loss spectroscopy quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, and first principles density functional theory calculations, enables the identification of the atomic structure of the 440&#160;nm blue emitter in hexagonal boron nitride as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Building on the atomic structure insights, nanoscale spatially precise creation of blue emitters is demonstrated by electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride. This advancement in correlating atomic structures with optical properties lays the foundation for a deeper understanding and precise engineering of quantum emitters, significantly advancing the development of cutting&#8208;edge quantum information technologies.

         <title>Neuromorphic Light&#8208;Responsive Organic Matter for in Materia Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we show that light&#8208;responsive adaptive organic matter can store and process information at the matter level, and emulate neuromorphic functionalities such as short term memory, long term memory and visual memory. Besides demonstrating that material dynamics can be exploited for spatio&#8208;temporal event detection and motion perception, we show that these adaptive photo&#8208;responsive organic systems can be exploited for hardware implementation of physical reservoir computing.








Abstract
Materials able to sense and respond to external stimuli by adapting their internal state to process and store information, represent promising candidates for implementing neuromorphic functionalities and brain&#8208;inspired computing paradigms. In this context, neuromorphic systems based on light&#8208;responsive materials enable the use of light as information carrier, allowing to emulate basic functions of the human retina. In this work it is demonstrated that optically&#8208;induced molecular dynamics in azopolymers can be exploited for neuromorphic&#8208;type of data processing in the analog domain and for computing at the matter level (i.e., in materia). Besides showing that azopolymers can be exploited for data storage, it is demonstrated that the adaptiveness of these materials enables the implementation of synaptic functionalities including short&#8208;term memory, long&#8208;term memory, and visual memory. Results show that azopolymers allow event detection and motion perception, enabling physical implementation of information processing schemes requiring real&#8208;time analysis of spatio&#8208;temporal inputs. Furthermore, it is shown that light&#8208;induced dynamics can be exploited for the in materia implementation of the unconventional computing paradigm denoted as reservoir computing. This work underscores the potential of azopolymers as promising materials for developing adaptive, intelligent photo&#8208;responsive systems that mimic some of the complex processing abilities of biological systems.

         <title>Low Dielectric and High Thermal Conductive Phononic Crystal Nanofiber Metamaterial Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phononic crystal nanofiber film is fabricated via localized crystallization of polyimide (PI) induced by boron nitride nanosheets. The aligned crystalline domains form efficient phonon transport pathways (6.51 W/(m&#183;K)), while the amorphous PI surrounding the fibers hinders dipole alignment, yielding an ultralow dielectric constant (2.63). This structural engineering resolves the thermal&#8208;dielectric trade&#8208;off in 3D integrated circuit packaging.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of 3D heterogeneous integration technology has created stringent requirements for the thermal conductivity of low dielectric materials. However, common low dielectric materials generally have low thermal conductivity, which hinders the ability to simultaneously optimize signal transmission and heat dissipation in integrated systems. Here, a crystallization control strategy is proposed to tackle the challenge of balancing high thermal conductivity with a low dielectric constant. Through precise control of synthesis parameters, a phononic crystal nanofiber (NF) metamaterial film composed of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) and crystalline polyimide (PI) bridges has been successfully developed. The crystalline PI bridging structure and BNNS synergistically form a phononic crystal&#8208;like metamaterial inside the fiber, enhancing lattice vibration and facilitating heat transfer. Meanwhile, the PI around the fiber maintains a long&#8208;range disordered structure, hindering the arrangement of dipoles. The synergistic effect enables the phononic crystal NF film to achieve a high thermal conductivity of up to 6.51&#160;W/(m&#183;k) and a relatively low dielectric constant of 2.63, thereby enhancing the energy efficiency of 3D integrated systems.

         <title>Nanoconfinement of Ammonia Borane via Hybrid&#8208;Phased Titanate Nanocrystals Enables Sustained H2 Release for Diabetic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid phased titanates are leveraged to achieve nanoconfinement of ammonia borane (AB) via a distinctive one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This approach enables sustained H2 release while mitigating the detrimental reaction between AB and hydrogen peroxide in pathological conditions. The released H2, in synergy with magnesium ions, effectively promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration in a diabetic model.









Abstract
Despite its potential in hydrogen (H2) therapy, ammonia borane (AB) has limited biomedical applications due to its uncontrolled hydrolysis rate and potential to cause cytotoxicity. Existing material&#8208;based delivery strategies focus on accelerating AB hydrolysis for H2 production, hence exacerbating these issues. A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid&#8208;phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H2 release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H2 release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H2 release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes&#8208;related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg2+) synergistically promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration.

A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen-deficient, hybrid-phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one-end-anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes-related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) synergistically promotes innervated-vascularized bone regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Single Atom Alloys for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) that integrate the advantages of Single atom catalysts (SACs) and Single atom alloys (SAAs) are successfully fabricated via incorporating ultrathin Mo layer on the surface of Mo2C matrix, exhibiting superior catalytic activity toward HER.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) achieve 100% utilization of metal atoms and have versatile support effects, whereas single atom alloys (SAAs) with metallic bonds own the free&#8208;atom&#8208;like electronic structure. Herein, surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) are developed that integrate the advantages of SACs and SAAs via incorporating an ultrathin metallic layer during the synthetic process of SACs. It is shown that the Pt single atom preferentially coordinates with metallic Mo nanolayer, thereby forming a Pt1&#8208;MoL surface atom alloy on Mo2C (marked as Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs). Comprehensive spectroscopic and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo nanolayer in SSAAs not only functions as an electron buffer between Pt1 and Mo2C, leading to a free&#8208;atom&#8208;like d state at Pt1 sites and thereby balancing the adsorption and desorption of H, but also enhances the aggregation, adsorption, and activation of H2O. Consequently, the Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs exhibit superior alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance compared to Pt1/Mo2C SACs, achieving a low overpotential of 12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 17&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into the design of advanced single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Competitive Ion Coordination in Gel Polymer Electrolytes Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Strength and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) decouples ionic conductivity and mechanical strength via competitive coordination between succinonitrile and polymer, resolving their trade&#8208;off. Interpolymer H&#8208;bonding compresses GPE, inducing molecular aggregation that channels anions into Li+ solvation shells to stabilize anode interfaces. This enables pouch cells with energy density over 450 Wh kg&#8722;1, advancing lithium metal battery electrolyte design.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show great potential for lithium&#8208;metal batteries, but balancing high ionic conductivity with robust mechanical properties remains challenging. In this study, a competitive coordination strategy is proposed to address this issue by incorporating highly polar succinonitrile (SN) into a poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylamide) (PMAm) matrix. The strong Li+ affinity of SN enables effective displacement of lithium ions from polymer hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites, maintaining the polymer's structural integrity while enhancing mechanical strength. Additionally, the hydrogen bonding between polymer chains compresses the polymer matrix, inducing molecular aggregation that creates fast diffusion pathways for Li+ and promotes anion participation in the solvation shell, facilitating the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). As a result, the resulting PMAm&#8208;SN GPE exhibits excellent toughness (24.8&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (2.8 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and high Li+ transference number of 0.76. When paired with a LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode, the GPE demonstrates a 90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 4.3&#160;V. A practical 5 Ah Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell delivers 456&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density and demonstrates outstanding safety under thermal and mechanical abuse, showcasing the potential of this GPE for practical applications.

         <title>Revealing the Altermagnetism in Hematite via XMCD Imaging and Anomalous Hall Electrical Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines X&#8208;ray magnetic imaging and electrical transport to uncover the anomalous Hall effect in hematite, an insulating oxide exhibiting unconventional altermagnetic properties. Imaging reveals distinct magnetic domains linked to crystal symmetry, and angular&#8208;dependent transport measurements highlight unusual symmetry&#8208;driven conductivity behaviors. This comprehensive approach establishes hematite as a model altermagnetic material for spintronics research.








Abstract
Altermagnets are a class of magnetic materials that exhibit unconventional transport properties, such as an anomalous Hall effect (AHE), despite having compensated sublattice magnetic moments. In this study, fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3), is reported combining electrical transport with advanced X&#8208;ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. These measurements directly visualize the N&#233;el vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry&#8208;driven transport behavior. The transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific N&#233;el vector alignments. Supported by first&#8208;principles theoretical calculations, how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed AHE is explained. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic&#160;technologies.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Driven Stochasticity: Bi&#8208;Heterojunction Noise&#8208;Enhanced Negative Transconductance Transistor in Image Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work engineered a bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance (BHN&#8208;NTC) transistor using a half&#8208;PTCDI&#8208;C13 layer, achieving expanded and tunable noise characteristics. This advancement enables efficient multi&#8208;bit TRNGs for AI&#8208;driven image generation and enhances logic circuit applications.








Abstract
Reliable true&#8208;random number generator (TRNG) hardware demands amplified intrinsic noise and multi&#8208;bit entropy output, which are difficult to achieve in conventional single&#8208;device TRNG implementation. A bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance (BHN&#8208;NTC) transistor is presented, incorporating an asymmetric PTCDI&#8208;C13 layer into an NTC transistor. This design enhances electron injection, expanding the NTC region (19 &#8594; 27&#160;V) and increasing negative transconductance (&#8722;0.036 &#181;S at VGS = &#8722;11&#160;V &#8594; &#8722;0.073 &#181;S at VGS = &#8722;15&#160;V) by reducing the electron injection barrier (&#8776;2.13&#160;eV &#8594; &#8776;0.41&#160;eV). The bi&#8208;heterojunction configuration introduces a strong correlation between noises, including trapping/detrapping and generation/recombination processes. This property enables a threefold higher entropy throughput in TRNG, achieving a 3&#8208;bit output per sampling event. The BHN&#8208;NTC&#8208;driven TRNG leverages increased noise&#8208;induced entropy to generate more diverse latent vectors, mitigating mode collapse and enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;quality, realistic images. This significantly enhances StyleGAN2&#8208;based image generation, improving performance metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) (18.7 &#8594; 8.3), kernel inception distance (KID) (0.024 &#8594; 0.009), inception score (IS) (6.5 &#8594; 9.2), and multi&#8208;scale structural similarity (MS&#8208;SSIM) (0.43 &#8594; 0.21). Consequently, the BHN&#8208;NTC transistor establishes a scalable stochastic noise platform, advancing applications in secure electronics and probabilistic stochastic computing.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable true-random number generator (TRNG) hardware demands amplified intrinsic noise and multi-bit entropy output, which are difficult to achieve in conventional single-device TRNG implementation. A bi-heterojunction noise-enhanced negative transconductance (BHN-NTC) transistor is presented, incorporating an asymmetric PTCDI-C13 layer into an NTC transistor. This design enhances electron injection, expanding the NTC region (19 &#8594; 27&#160;V) and increasing negative transconductance (&#8722;0.036 &#181;S at &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;11&#160;V &#8594; &#8722;0.073 &#181;S at &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;15&#160;V) by reducing the electron injection barrier (&#8776;2.13&#160;eV &#8594; &#8776;0.41&#160;eV). The bi-heterojunction configuration introduces a strong correlation between noises, including trapping/detrapping and generation/recombination processes. This property enables a threefold higher entropy throughput in TRNG, achieving a 3-bit output per sampling event. The BHN-NTC-driven TRNG leverages increased noise-induced entropy to generate more diverse latent vectors, mitigating mode collapse and enabling the synthesis of high-quality, realistic images. This significantly enhances StyleGAN2-based image generation, improving performance metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) (18.7 &#8594; 8.3), kernel inception distance (KID) (0.024 &#8594; 0.009), inception score (IS) (6.5 &#8594; 9.2), and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) (0.43 &#8594; 0.21). Consequently, the BHN-NTC transistor establishes a scalable stochastic noise platform, advancing applications in secure electronics and probabilistic stochastic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 1000 Wh Kg&#8722;1 Cathode Facilitated by In Situ Mineralized Electrolyte with Electron Potential Well for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mineralized electrolyte with Prussian blue analog electron potential wells revolutionizes aqueous zinc batteries, enabling a 1000 Wh kg&#8722;1 cathode and dendrite&#8208;free anode. This design mediates rapid iodine&#8208;bromine redox reactions, achieves multi&#8208;electron transfer, and ensures stable cycling over 6000 cycles. The breakthrough offers a scalable pathway for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan zinc batteries.








Abstract
The practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZMBs) are hindered by challenges such as low energy density and limited cycle life, which stem from the one&#8208;electron transfer at the cathode and dendrite formation at the anode. Herein, inspired by the biomineralization phenomenon in nature, an in situ mineralized electrolyte (IME) containing Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as an electron potential well is designed. This in situ mineralization strategy promotes uniform, rapid, and reversible charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, enabling the Iodine (I&#8322;) cathode to achieve a specific capacity of 286.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1 A g&#8315;&#185; and an energy density of 330.8&#160;Wh kg&#8315;&#185;. Simultaneously, the potential well facilitates the in situ recovery of Zn dendrites into active Zn2&#8314; ions, ensuring stable Zn anode cycling with a practical areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8315;2 for 1500 h. Furthermore, the mediation of iodine&#8208;bromine chemistry enables highly reversible Br&#8304;/Br&#8315; and I&#8314;/I&#8304;/I&#8315; reactions, achieving an energy density of more than 1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Additionally, an enhanced energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1 and a high energy efficiency of 86.73% over 6000 cycles are achieved. In summary, the in situ mineralization of an electron potential well in electrolyte offers a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs.

         <title>Detachable and Reusable: Reinforced &#960;&#8208;Ion Film for Modular Synaptic Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), addressing the rapid degradation of organic semiconductor layers. By introducing a mesh support and utilizing a scalable solvent exchange method, the &#960;&#8208;ion film enhances detachability and stability. The resulting OECTs demonstrate superior performance and synaptic properties, paving the way for sustainable, modular electronic systems.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show significant promise for bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing applications due to their low operating voltage, biocompatibility, and ion&#8208;mediated charge transport. However, conventional OECTs with permanently fixed organic semiconductor (OSC) layers lack modularity and reusability for sustainable electronics with e&#8208;waste reduction. Here, a novel reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film OECT featuring a detachable and reusable OSC layer that creates a unified composite with dielectric and gate components, establishing a new paradigm for modular device architectures is proposed. Through solvent exchange and mesh&#8208;supported gelation, &#960;&#8208;ion film exhibits enhanced mechanical stability, detachability, and superior electrical performance. The OECTs demonstrate remarkable 35&#8208;day air stability, 50&#8208;day storage lifetime, and over 80% performance retention after 600 electrical cycles. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;ion film OECTs exhibit synaptic behavior with paired&#8208;pulse facilitation of 167% and long&#8208;term memory retention of 34% maintained synaptic current after 250 s. These characteristics enable reservoir computing applications with a 4&#8208;bit encoding scheme for image recognition, processing 16 &#215; 16 pixelated input patterns, demonstrating reliable state differentiation and stable signal retention. Even at lab&#8208;scale development, reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film OECTs represent a promising eco&#8208;friendly platform for modular, reusable components in next&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing systems, aligning with electronic waste reduction policies by enabling component reuse.

A new silicate electrolyte and synthesized K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 is is developed which exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 via a rational vacancy design strategy. DFT calculations show that potassium ions diffuse on the ac plane. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are promising options for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety and abundance of potassium resources. However, solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are still in their infancy and the reported electrolyte materials are very limited, making the exploration of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and physical/electrochemical stability a major challenge. Here novel triclinic K3LnSi3O9 (Ln = Y and Gd) potassium&#8208;ion solid electrolyte is reported with low activation energy and high stability. A rational vacancy design strategy is adopted to synthesize K3&#8722;xGdPxSi3&#8722;xO9 and the result of DFT calculation shows that the diffusion pathways of potassium ions on the ac plane exhibit a fish scale&#8208;like network structure. Specifically, the K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 delivers a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a stable potassium stripping/plating (a long&#8208;life cycle over 2000&#160;h). As a result, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C (500 cycles, 95.9% capacity retention). These results would no doubt boost research for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems that can replace conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Further enhancement in battery performance requires the formation of a stable physical interfacial contact between the active material (AM) in the electrode and the solid electrolyte (SE). However, reducing the resistance at the AM&#8211;SE interface remains a key challenge. This study focuses on Li3PS4&#8208;xLiBH4 (LPSBH), a sulfide&#8208;based SE with an argyrodite structure, synthesized by mechanical milling. Although LPSBH is known for its high ionic conductivity, its mechanical properties are not thoroughly examined. Here, the deformability of LPSBH is evaluated by demonstrating that it can be formed at low pressures to achieve high relative density. A quantitative evaluation of the AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact using symmetric cells demonstrates the formation of a good AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact within the electrode layer. A 13 mAh&#8208;class laminated cell with LPSBH stacked onto the negative electrode achieves 6C charging at 25 &#176;C&#160;under a low stacked pressure of 5&#160;MPa, along with significant cycle stability, which retains &#8776;70% capacity after 1000 cycles under 1C/1C conditions.

         <title>Organic Thermoluminescence Driven by Electron Back Transfer: Microsecond Explosive Emission to Persistent Multi&#8208;Hour Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thermoluminescent materials are developed using radical pairs for energy storage, controlled by transannular sulfur&#8208;oxygen interactions that drive a back electron transfer (BET) process. This results in tunable luminescence, from long afterglows to microsecond flash, depending on temperature. The materials exhibit stability under extreme conditions, such as maintaining luminescence in boiling water, making them ideal for applications like radiation detection and thermoluminescent afterglow imaging.








Abstract
Precise control over the release of light energy, distinct from conventional thermal energy management, poses significant challenges in luminescent technologies. This study pioneers organic above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoluminescent materials using radical pairs as energy storage centers (ESCs), enabling controlled light energy release from multi&#8208;hour afterglows to microsecond&#8208;scale explosive bursts, accelerating the energy release rate by up to 1.8 &#215; 108 times. Notably, the unique transannular interactions between sulfur and oxygen in thianthrene oxides facilitate a thermally driven back electron transfer (BET) process based on radical pairs, central to the energy storage and release mechanism. Due to this BET process, these materials precisely modulate luminescence and exhibit robust stability, maintaining luminescence for 4 h in boiling water and storing energy in air for over six months. These findings advance organic thermoluminescence, highlight the significance of BET processes in various domains, and set new performance benchmarks for luminescent materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiferroic Liquids: Ferroelectric and Ferromagnetic Order in a Hybrid Nanoparticle&#8211;Liquid Crystal System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid fluid combining ferrimagnetic nanoplatelets and a ferroelectric nematic displays coexisting magnetization and polarisation at room temperature. This self&#8208;assembled multiferroic shows strong magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear optical response, offering a soft, reconfigurable platform for next&#8208;generation sensing, actuation, and photonic applications.








Abstract
Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self&#8208;assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, an example of a liquid is demonstrated that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director&#8208;mediated interactions drive the self&#8208;assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the coupling between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Conducting Elastomer with High Stretchability and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting elastomer, engineered via ionic liquid&#8208;modulated phase separation of PBFDO/TPU blends, achieves high conductivity (&gt;200&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;) and stretchability (&gt;200% strain). The first stretchable thermoelectric generator using n&#8208;/p&#8208;type elastomers demonstrates efficient energy harvesting, with robust performance in wearable applications under mechanical stress.








Abstract
Stretchable n&#8208;type conducting polymers are crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance optoelectronic and bioelectronic devices, yet their development lags significantly behind that of p&#8208;type counterparts due to the intrinsic challenge of harmonizing electrical conductivity with mechanical compliance. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to engineer a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conductive elastomer by synergistically blending the n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and modulating phase separation via the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. The resulting PBFDO/TPU/IL composites (PBTI) achieve an unprecedented combination of n&#8208;type electrical conductivity exceeding 200&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;, fracture elongation surpassing 200%, and robust operational stability, outperforming existing stretchable n&#8208;type conductive polymers. The controlled phase&#8208;segregated morphology ensures efficient charge transport while maintaining elastomeric resilience, addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between conductivity and stretchability. PBTI is integrated with a p&#8208;type PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based elastomer to demonstrate its versatility in constructing a stretchable thermoelectric generator (TEG), which exhibits a reliable power output under mechanical deformation. Further applications in fire safety warnings and real&#8208;time human physiological monitoring underscore the material's practicality in adaptive wearable and implantable systems. This work breaks new ground in n&#8208;type stretchable conductors, paving the way for sophisticated bioelectronics and self&#8208;powered devices requiring balanced electronic and mechanical functionalities.

         <title>Organic&#8210;Inorganic Multiscale Crosslinking Assembly for Ultrahigh&#8208;Toughness Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sodium alginate (SA) molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, progressing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk. The resulting organic&#8210;inorganic molecular interactions and highly integrated hierarchical ordered structure endow the nanocomposites with exceptional ultrahigh toughness, significantly outperforming conventional counterparts.








Abstract
Strength and toughness have traditionally been regarded as mutually exclusive, but simultaneously achieving both high strength and high toughness in organic&#8210;inorganic nanocomposites remains a significant challenge. Inspired by natural nacre and bone, inorganic ionic oligomers and organic molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, advancing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk nanocomposite materials. This process results in a highly integrated organic&#8210;inorganic hierarchical ordered structure, imparting exceptional record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh toughness (558.90&#160;&#177;&#160;34.84&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent tensile strength (353.84&#160;&#177;&#160;18.77&#160;MPa), and fracture energy (2.93&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2) to the nanocomposite films. The resulting bulk nanocomposite exhibits outstanding bending mechanical properties (a maximum bending stress of 207.17&#160;&#177;&#160;12.37&#160;MPa, and a bending energy of 37.62&#160;&#177;&#160;7.33&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 without fracture), exceptional fatigue resistance, and remarkable toughness in extreme environments (e.g., &#8722;196 and 200&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the nanocomposites can undergo hydrothermal&#8208;induced recycling and regeneration owing to their noncovalent crosslinking nature. Consequently, these nanocomposites exhibit significant potential for applications in high&#8208;performance structural engineering materials. The proposed organic&#8210;inorganic multiscale crosslinking assembly tactic based on inorganic ionic oligomers presents a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrahigh&#8208;toughness nanocomposites.

Inspired by natural nacre and bone, inorganic ionic oligomers and organic molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, advancing from the ionic-molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk nanocomposite materials. This process results in a highly integrated organic&#8210;inorganic hierarchical ordered structure, imparting exceptional record-breaking ultrahigh toughness (558.90&#160;&#177;&#160;34.84&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent tensile strength (353.84&#160;&#177;&#160;18.77&#160;MPa), and fracture energy (2.93&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to the nanocomposite films. The resulting bulk nanocomposite exhibits outstanding bending mechanical properties (a maximum bending stress of 207.17&#160;&#177;&#160;12.37&#160;MPa, and a bending energy of 37.62&#160;&#177;&#160;7.33&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; without fracture), exceptional fatigue resistance, and remarkable toughness in extreme environments (e.g., &#8722;196 and 200&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the nanocomposites can undergo hydrothermal-induced recycling and regeneration owing to their noncovalent crosslinking nature. Consequently, these nanocomposites exhibit significant potential for applications in high-performance structural engineering materials. The proposed organic&#8210;inorganic multiscale crosslinking assembly tactic based on inorganic ionic oligomers presents a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrahigh-toughness nanocomposites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Effect of Mesoporous Metal Oxides Promotes Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxide electrocatalysts is demonstrated to lower the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and thus facilitate two&#8208;step tandem nitrate reduction electrocatalysis for selective ammonia electrosynthesis in a more sustainable manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) in water offers a sustainable alternative for robust electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) in ambient conditions. However, NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysis generally involves two&#8208;step tandem routes and suffers from sluggish hydrodeoxygenation kinetics, which result in a low ammonia selectivity and yield rate. In this work, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxides remarkably decreases the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and facilitates two&#8208;step tandem electrocatalysis of NO3&#8722;RR, which thus promotes selective NH3 electrosynthesis in an alkaline condition. By comparing a series of high&#8208;entropy mesoporous metal oxides and corresponding metal alloys and monometallic counterparts, high&#8208;entropy mesoporous (CoMnFeNiCu)3O4 discloses the highest electrocatalytic performance for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;RR, including remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.3%, high NH3 yield rate of 1.83 mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and excellent recycling stability of 20 cycles, representing one of the best electrocatalysts reported in the past three years. Moreover, cathode NO3&#8722;RR performance for selective NH3 electrosynthesis is enhanced when further coupled with the thermodynamically favorable benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction at the anode. It is expected that the high&#8208;entropy effect opens up a new route to design a library of novel tandem mesoporous metal electrocatalysts for the selective electrosynthesis of various valuable chemicals from wastewater.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Element Composition Modulation Strategy for Designing High&#8208;Capacity and Stable O3&#8208;Type Na&#8208;Layered Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;element composition modulation strategy is proposed for cathodes of NIBs, exemplified by LFANMT (NaLi0.05Fe0.04Al0.01Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.1O2), achieving over 180&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 4.3&#160;V. A stress&#8208;protective layer is constructed to alleviate the internal and external stress differences caused by uneven Na+ extraction during the O3&#8208;P3 phase transition. Cathodes exhibiting excellent cycling stability with negligible voltage decay under high voltage is successfully obtained.








Abstract
Unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes remain a substantial barrier to enhancing the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs). While the high&#8208;entropy strategy has demonstrated significant advantages in improving the performance of layered oxide cathodes, the specific capacities of reported high&#8208;entropy oxides remain relatively low (&lt;150&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). This prompts a reconsideration toward leveraging not just high entropy, but also the synergy among multiple elements to meet the demands for higher energy density. Herein, a multi&#8208;element composition modulation strategy is proposed to obtain cathodes without compromising on capacity, exemplified by LFANMT (NaLi0.05Fe0.04Al0.01Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.1O2), which achieves a remarkable specific capacity exceeding 180&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 4.3&#160;V. It is visualized that single&#8208;crystal particles with surface compressive stress and bulk tensile stress exhibit superior surface lattice oxygen stability and crack resistance during cycling. Constructing an initial stress&#8208;protective layer is beneficial for alleviating the internal and external stress differences caused by uneven Na+ extraction during the O3&#8208;P3 phase transition. Through precise elemental modulation, cathodes exhibiting excellent cycling stability with negligible voltage decay under high voltage are successfully obtained. The work provides an effective approach for designing high&#8208;capacity O3&#8208;type layered oxides for NIBs, emphasizing the importance of synergistic effects among elements.

         <title>How the Arrangement of Platinum Atoms on Ruthenium Nanoparticles Improves Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy for the formation of Pt islands and their transformation into Pt atomic strings on Ru nanoparticle surfaces is presented. The thermodynamically favored configuration of Pt strings on Ru catalyst is demonstrated to catalyze HER via the faster Volmer&#8211;Tafel pathway with a significantly improved intrinsic activity, owing to the well&#8208;aligned Pt&#8208;Ru sites adjacent to Pt&#8208;Pt sites.








Abstract
The platinum&#8208;ruthenium (PtRu) system is highly active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media with both Pt and Ru playing active roles in the water dissociation step that generates adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Precise control of the arrangement of Pt atoms on Ru nanoparticles can maximize the Pt&#8208;Ru sites for water dissociation and Pt&#8208;Pt sites for hydrogen production and can considerably improve HER catalytic performance. By directing the growth and distribution of Pt on Ru hourglass nanoparticles, the arrangement of Pt on Ru is controlled into forming Pt islands, small Pt clusters, and strings of a few Pt atoms. Calculations show that the unique atomic string arrangements of Pt on Ru is the thermodynamically favorable configuration. Additionally, these strings have a favorable combination of Pt&#8208;Ru and Pt&#8208;Pt sites, making the Pt&#8208;string on Ru the most active catalyst with a more than fivefold increase in turnover frequency for alkaline HER compared to the Pt&#8208;island on Ru catalyst. The results show how controlling the Pt atomic arrangement on Ru nanoparticle surfaces for the tuning of Pt&#8208;Pt and Pt&#8208;Ru neighboring sites can direct toward a more efficient HER mechanism and thereby significantly enhancing HER performance.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Entropy Garnet Electrolytes via Computational Screening for Stable Lithium Interfaces in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy stabilizes HE&#8208;LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments and compositional engineering. Through degradation mechanism exploration, lithium&#8208;compatible elements are selected, and unstable dopants (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) are excluded. A novel HE&#8208;LLZO (Li6.6La3Zr0.4Sn0.4Hf0.4Sc0.2Ta0.6O12) exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and stable cycling over 2,500 h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). High&#8208;entropy (HE) SSEs, leveraging multi&#8208;principal&#8208;element compositions, present a vast design space to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, the chemical complexity of HE SSEs introduces challenges in interfacial instability with lithium metal anodes due to the unavoidable inclusion of reactive elements. While conventional garnet&#8208;type SSEs are considered stable, it is revealed that five HE garnets (HE&#8208;LLZOs) undergo corrosion and partial dissolution upon lithium contact. Here, a rational design strategy is introduced to stabilize HE&#8208;LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments of interfacial reactivity with targeted compositional engineering. Through systematic exploration of element&#8208;specific degradation mechanisms, selection criteria for lithium&#8208;compatible principal elements are established.

&lt;p&gt;A rational design strategy stabilizes HE-LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments and compositional engineering. Through degradation mechanism exploration, lithium-compatible elements are selected, and unstable dopants (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) are excluded. A novel HE-LLZO (Li&lt;sub&gt;6.6&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cycling over 2,500 h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). High-entropy (HE) SSEs, leveraging multi-principal-element compositions, present a vast design space to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, the chemical complexity of HE SSEs introduces challenges in interfacial instability with lithium metal anodes due to the unavoidable inclusion of reactive elements. While conventional garnet-type SSEs are considered stable, it is revealed that five HE garnets (HE-LLZOs) undergo corrosion and partial dissolution upon lithium contact. Here, a rational design strategy is introduced to stabilize HE-LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments of interfacial reactivity with targeted compositional engineering. Through systematic exploration of element-specific degradation mechanisms, selection criteria for lithium-compatible principal elements are established. Guided by computational screening, unstable dopants are excluded (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) that drive interfacial degradation and synthesize a novel HE-LLZO (Li&lt;sub&gt;6.6&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) that exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cycling over 2,500 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the interfacial stability of Zr, Sn, and Ta while identifying Nb as a destabilizing element. This work provides an integrated computational-experimental framework for understanding element-property relationships in HE oxides, advancing durable SSEs design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sound, Force and Light Induced Emissions from Er3+&#8208;Mn2+ Doped ZnS/CaZnOS Heterostructure for Remote Temperature Monitoring via Photo&#8208; and Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Er3&#8314;/Mn2&#8314; co&#8208;doped ZnS/CaZnOS heterostructures are developed for remote temperature and force/sound sensing. The material exhibits UV/NIR photoluminescence, with energy transfer influencing color. Mechanoluminescence intensity is measured against applied power. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence enabled luminescence thermometry. Sound&#8208;induced mechanoluminescence, combined with thermometry, facilitated temperature detection during drilling and in heated systems. This demonstrates potential for excitation&#8208;light&#8208;free temperature probing.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) is a powerful phenomenon that enables light generation induced with mechanical or acoustic waves, and remote temperature sensing via luminescence thermometry techniques. In this work, the multi&#8208;functional, ML&#8208;active materials based on Er3+ and Mn2+ co&#8208;doped ZnS/CaZnOS heterostructure are developed for remote temperature monitoring and visual sensing of force and sound. The material exhibits characteristic photoluminescence (PL) under UV and NIR (up&#8208;conversion) excitation, with energy transfer from Er3+ to Mn2+ influencing the emission color. The effects of force&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion are studied in detail by measuring the ML intensity versus the applied power for Er3+ and Mn2+ emission in the single&#8208;doped and co&#8208;doped materials. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL is utilized to calibrate luminescence thermometry response, with Er3+ thermally&#8208;coupled levels and non&#8208;thermally&#8208;coupled levels of Er3+/Mn2+, providing temperature sensing capabilities. The unique combination of sound&#8208;induced ML with luminescence thermometry allowed optical temperature detection, alike during the drilling process, and in the externally heated system, using pulsed sonications. Whereas, applying continuous excitation, the sound&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion is studied and visualized using the developed ML&#8208;based optical thermometers. This approach demonstrates the excellent application potential of sound&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion for remote monitoring and, more importantly, for excitation&#8208;light&#8208;free temperature probing of different systems and working devices.

         <title>Supramolecular&#8208;Reinforced Hard&#8208;Phase Ionogels with Exceptional Mechanical Robustness and Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an echinoderm&#8208;inspired supramolecular ionogel is engineered with extreme robustness and damage tolerance via synergistic integration of hard&#8208;soft phase&#8208;separated architecture and multi&#8208;scale sacrificial bonding. The ionogel achieves advanced tensile strength, toughness, and unprecedented tear resistance, puncture energy, and high&#8208;speed impact resistance. Furthermore, a sensing matrix is developed that simultaneously accomplishes real&#8208;time limb motion tracking and precise damage localization.








Abstract
It is a formidable challenge to integrate superior damage tolerance into robust ionogels due to fundamental conflicts between covalent rigidity and dynamic energy dissipation. Herein, an echinoderm&#8208;inspired supramolecular ionogel is engineered with extreme robustness and damage tolerance via synergistic integration of hard&#8208;soft phase&#8208;separated architecture and multi&#8208;scale sacrificial bonding. The molecularly programmed hard segments of polyurethane integrate crystalline domains, high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which collectively enhance ionogel robustness, while a judiciously selected ionic liquid (IL) reinforced the hard phase via extensive IL&#8208;polymer multiple hydrogen bonds. The crystalline domains synergizing with reversible sacrificial bonds facilitated efficient energy dissipation through dynamic rupture/reformation mechanisms. Consequently, the supramolecular ionogel achieves advanced tensile strength (49.22&#160;MPa), elongation (1721.28%), toughness (424.09&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), Young's modulus (48.66&#160;MPa) and unprecedented damage tolerance, manifested as tear resistance (387.02&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, 59&#8208;fold that of polyurethane), outstanding puncture energy (1326.8 mJ), and exceptional high&#8208;speed impact resistance (228.74&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 at strain rate of 20&#160;000 s&#8722;1). Notably, the ionogel demonstrated autonomous room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing, broad operational temperature adaptability, flame retardancy, and recyclability. Furthermore, a wearable ionogel sensing matrix is developed to simultaneously accomplish real&#8208;time limb motion tracking and precise damage localization, targeting next&#8208;generation intelligent protective equipment to deliver integrated impact protection and flexible sensing.

         <title>Confining Quantum Dots Within Covalent Organic Framework Cages for Coupled CO2 Photoreduction and Value&#8208;Added Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D/0D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is constructed by spatially confining ZnSe quantum dots within covalent organic framework (COF) porous cages, enabling coupled CO2 photoreduction and value&#8208;added chemical synthesis. COF porous cages serve as nanoreactors, enriching reactant concentrations, and the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates charge separation. This synergistic integration of nanoconfinement and S&#8208;scheme charge modulation establishes an efficient and robust bifunctional platform.








Abstract
Coupling photocatalytic CO2 reduction with the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals represents a promising strategy to mitigate carbon emissions while maximizing solar energy utilization. Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive photocatalysts for such tandem reactions, owing to their size&#8208;tunable band structures, abundant surface&#8208;active sites, and strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. However, their implementation is often hindered by severe aggregation and sluggish mass transfer, which limit their photocatalytic performance. Herein, a spatially confined 3D/0D covalent organic framework (COF)/ZnSe QDs step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction photocatalyst is reported, prepared via an in situ encapsulation strategy, for concurrent CO2 photoreduction and organic transformation. The ZnSe QDs are immobilized within the nanoporous cages of the COF, forming a confined microenvironment that suppresses aggregation, enhances photostability, and promotes efficient mass transfer. As a result, the COF/ZnSe heterostructure achieves a CO generation rate of 128.3 &#181;mol g&#8315;1 h&#8315;1, while synchronously delivering 95.1% conversion of 1&#8208;phenylethanol to 1&#8208;phenylethanone under light irradiation. The hierarchical COF matrix acts as a nanoreactor, enriching local CO2 concentration within its porous network, while the rationally designed S&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates directional charge flow, ensuring robust redox selectivity. This work provides a generalizable strategy for designing advanced heterostructured photocatalysts for efficient bifunctional solar chemical conversions.

         <title>Dilute Electrolyte with Vehicular Aggregates for Stable High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute electrolyte with a novel vehicular anion&#8211;solvent&#8211;Li&#8314; aggregates (AGG) mechanism is achieved using a pyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl fluoride with an optimal steric hindrance. It enables a high ionic conductivity of 4.9 mS cm&#8722;1, excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, and stable 4.6 V Li&#8208;metal batteries with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;nickel cathodes, achieving 228.4 mAh g&#8722;1, good rate capability, and cycling stability.








Abstract
Electrolyte design is critical for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) because it dictates the aggressive Li&#8211;electrolyte interphase that governs cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, traditional high&#8208; or locally high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, which achieve good Li&#8208;metal compatibility by the formation of anion&#8210;solvent&#8210;Li+ aggregates (AGG), typically suffer from poor ionic conductivity (e.g., &#8776;1 mS cm&#8722;1). Therefore, achieving both high ionic conductivity and AGG&#8208;dominated solvation structure under dilute conditions still remains a challenge. Herein, a novel dilute electrolyte with vehicular aggregates (DVA) mechanism is proposed by employing pyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl fluoride (PSF) solvent with optimal steric hindrance&#160;effect. Based on this DVA electrolyte, the uniquely AGG&#8208;dominated solvation structure under dilute conditions achieve high ionic conductivity (4.9 mS cm&#8722;1) featuring its vehicular ion&#8208;transport mechanism. It&#160;exhibits good Li&#8208;metal compatibility with high stripping&#8208;plating CE of &#8776;99.5% with inorganic (LiF, Li2O)&#8208;rich robust solid&#8210;electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, the electrolyte effectively suppresses the stress&#8208;corrosion cracking, transition&#8208;metal dissolution, gas evolution, and detrimental surface degradation on the cathode side, thus enabling 4.6&#8208;V&#8208;class LMBs with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;Ni cathodes to deliver a high discharge capacity of 228.4 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability up to 2C, and 87% capacity retention after 150 cycles. This work offers a promising approach for designing advanced electrolytes for high&#8208;energy LMBs.

         <title>Switching the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Mechanism through the Creation of Disordered NiOOH Induced by Electrochemical Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that combines amorphous structure engineering and sacrificial Mo6+ is developed to control the electrochemical reconstruction of nickel oxide, thereby generating disordered NiOOH. The disordered NiOOH with significantly enhanced metal&#8208;oxygen covalency triggers the switch of OER mechanism from the AEM to the LOM, and thus achieving an overpotential of 201 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical reconstruction behavior of electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key to determining their performance. Despite its critical role, precisely controlling and rationally guiding this reconstruction behavior remains an elusive challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is reported to manipulate the reconstruction behavior of nickel oxides by concurrently introducing amorphous structure and easily oxidizable elements (i.e., Mo6+). Specifically, the amorphous structure promotes the reconstruction at a low potential and the oxidative removal of Mo6+, enabling the generation of disordered NiOOH (d&#8208;NiOOH) with abundant defects. Notably, the d&#8208;NiOOH markedly enhances the Ni&#8211;O covalency and thus triggers the reaction mechanism transition from the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM). As a result, the d&#8208;NiOOH displays excellent performance for the OER with an overpotential of 201 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, surpassing the ordered NiOOH (o&#8208;NiOOH, 286 mV). Remarkably, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) assembled with a&#8208;NiMoO as the anodic catalyst can attain a large current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at a small voltage of 1.79 V, outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Texture in Fe3O4 Thin Films on SiO2 Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3O4 thin films grown on ordered SiO2 nanospheres form curved nanocaps with 3D geometry, inducing magnetic domain texture. X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy (XMCD&#8208;PEEM), cross&#8208;sectional electron microscopy (STEM), and polarized grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (GISANS) reveal how topography modulates magnetization. This system provides a new platform to explore geometry&#8208;induced magnetic phenomena at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Topographically complex interfaces offer a promising route to engineer magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with potential implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and neuromorphic devices. Here, Fe3O4 thin films are grown on self&#8208;assembled SiO2 nanospheres to investigate how local curvature, together with polycrystalline morphology, influence magnetic behavior compared to flat films. STEM and GISANS confirm connected growth with preserved lateral ordering, while XMCD&#8208;PEEM reveals in&#8208;plane magnetic domains that extend across both nanosphere&#8208;patterned and flat regions. Despite the low net magnetization of the Fe3O4 caps, their domain orientations align with neighboring flat areas, indicating correlated domain behavior across structurally different regions. These findings demonstrate how nanoscale topography and morphology can be leveraged as design parameters to modulate magnetism in complex&#160;oxides.

         <title>Achieving 20.80% Efficiency in Ternary Organic Solar Cells via Suppression of Static and Dynamic Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric acceptor NVN is incorporated as a guest component into the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#160;host blend to fabricate high&#8208;performance OSCs. Incorporation of NVN suppresses both dynamic and static disorder, resulting in mitigated trap states, reduced energy loss, and improved charge transport. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO:NVN&#8208;based&#160;ternary OSCs achieve a remarkable efficiency of 20.80% with superior photostability.








Abstract
Suppressing energetic disorder represents a critical pathway toward high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a ternary system is successfully developed to regulate the energetic disorder and enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs through strategic incorporation of a dimeric acceptor NVN into D18:L8&#8208;BO host. It is demonstrated that NVN incorporation simultaneously suppresses&#160;both&#160;static&#160;and&#160;dynamic disorder. Crucially, NVN&#8208;mediated suppression of dynamic disorder achieved through suppressing structural relaxation is identified as the dominant factor enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and minimizing non&#8208;radiative energy loss. Furthermore, NVN optimizes the double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), induces graded vertical phase separation, and enhances molecular packing order. These morphological improvements reinforce structural regularity and mitigate static disorder. As a result, suppressed trap states, retrained energy loss, facilitated exciton dissociation, and improved charge transport are achieved in the ternary system. Owing to these synergistic effects, the D18:L8&#8208;BO:NVN&#160;ternary OSC achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.80% (certified 20.39%) with enhanced operational photostability. Overall, this work underscores the fundamental importance of energetic disorder control in achieving high&#8208;performance OSCs.

A high&#8208;capacity polyimide&#8208;linked porous organic polymer (HAT&#8208;PTO) incorporating numerous redox&#8208;active centers is synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction, delivering a high theoretical capacity of 484&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ hybridization with carboxyl&#8208;functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes enhances conductivity and stability, achieving 397&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at C/10, outstanding rate capability (225&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;C), and robust cycling over 6000 cycles.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;capacity, sustainable cathode materials remains a critical challenge in advancing lithium&#8208;ion battery technologies for next&#8208;generation energy storage. Organic electrode materials (OEMs) represent a promising alternative to conventional inorganic cathodes, owing to their composition from earth&#8208;abundant elements and chemically tunable structures that enable high theoretical capacities. Herein, a polyimide&#8208;linked porous organic polymer (HAT&#8208;PTO) is reported to be synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal reaction from redox&#8208;active hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) building blocks. The resulting HAT&#8208;PTO framework incorporates multiple redox&#8208;active C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N centers, delivering a high theoretical capacity of 484&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. To overcome limitations in electronic conductivity, hybrid materials are synthesized by in situ growth of HAT&#8208;PTO on multiwalled pristine (CNT) and carboxyl&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (cCNT). Notably, the HAT&#8208;PTO&#8208;cCNT hybrid delivers a high capacity of 397&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at C/10, outstanding rate capability of 225&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;C, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 171&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles at 2&#160;C. Ex situ FT&#8208;IR, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the involvement of both HAT and PTO units in the charge storage mechanism. This work presents a molecular design strategy and scalable synthesis approach toward high&#8208;performance organic cathodes, paving the way for durable, high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>Bioprinted Constructs in the Regulatory Landscape: Current State and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioprinting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technology in biomedical research, offering unprecedented potential to replicate complex tissues. Despite its promise, clinical translation remains limited due to regulatory hurdles. This review explores global regulatory frameworks, comparing approaches in the EU, U.S., China, and Australia, and outlines strategies for future developments.








Abstract
Bioprinting has become one of the leading topics in biomedical research in the past decade, as demonstrated by the great surge in publications and proliferation of bioprinting facilities worldwide. Bioprinting has gained widespread popularity because of its potential to replicate complex biological structures, revolutionize in vitro testing, and tissue engineering. However, the clinical translation of bioprinted products remains a challenge. The regulatory approval of tissue&#8208;engineered products requires extensive preclinical and clinical trials with different standards worldwide. The regulatory landscape for bioprinted products is examined in the European Union, United States, China, and Australia. The current regulatory status of bioprinting is traced by exploring parallels with existing categories such as 3D printed medical devices, injectable hydrogels, and tissue engineering products. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and regulatory landscape of bioprinted constructs, envisioning challenges, and strategies for their future integration into clinical practice.

         <title>Janus Graphene Oxide Nanoplatform with Oppositely Functionalized Adhesion and Lubrication Enables Local Sustained Fenofibrate Release to Synergistically Halt Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Janus graphene oxide&#8208;based nanoplatform to combat osteoarthritis. The system's efficacy is based on four synergistic functions: adhering stably to the cartilage surface, filling micro&#8208;damage to restore integrity, providing consistent lubrication to reduce friction, and delivering an anti&#8208;aging medication locally to cells. This integrated multifunctional approach represents a powerful and promising new strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) progresses via a destructive cycle involving cartilage damage, friction, lubrication loss, and chondrocyte senescence. Current therapies, limited to temporary lubrication or pain relief, fail to halt OA due to their inability to repair cartilage or restore innate lubrication. To address this challenge, an asymmetric Janus graphene oxide (MGO) nanoplatform is engineered and functionalized with the anti&#8208;senescence agent Fenofibrate (FN), creating the MGO&#8208;FN system. This integrated design features one side providing robust cartilage adhesion and the opposing side offering superior lubrication, while simultaneously delivering the therapeutic FN. Critically, the nanoscale MGO&#8208;FN effectively infiltrates and fills micro&#8208;damage on the cartilage surface, enabling localized and sustained FN release. This maximizes drug bioavailability at the target site by minimizing diffusion distances. In vitro, MGO&#8208;FN demonstrated potent synergistic effects, significantly enhancing chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, reducing senescence, and upregulating the lubrication marker PRG4 more effectively than either component alone. In vivo OA rat studies, supported by transcriptomics analysis, validated MGO&#8208;FN's potent therapeutic effects, including reduced cartilage degradation, mitigated inflammation, promoted matrix regeneration, and restored innate lubrication. These findings underscore MGO&#8208;FN as a promising multifaceted therapeutic strategy to halt OA progression by concurrently restoring cartilage integrity and lubricating function.

         <title>3D Printing of Gradient Biomimetic Scaffold via Electrochemical Molecular Lock for Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple preparation method is proposed for continuous gradient scaffolds. It addresses the difficulty of simultaneously reproducing multi&#8208;scale anisotropy and continuous gradient structures in vitro. This study proposes a novel method for constructing bio&#8208;grade continuous gradient hydrogel scaffolds, paving the way for new avenues in engineering biomimetic tissue scaffolds.








Abstract
Gradient structures are widely present in tissues. The natural gradient exhibits an accuracy of 10 nm and possesses a four&#8208;level multi&#8208;scale structure (10nm&#8211;1cm). The accuracy of biological 3D printing is approximately 5um, which presents huge challenges in simultaneously replicating multi&#8208;scale anisotropy and continuous gradient structures in vitro. Here, a fabrication method termed as electrochemical training of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel is reported that leverages gradient ion coordination and molecular locking to achieve the rapid assembly of disordered hydrogel to fill this gap. This ETH (electrochemical training hydrogel) scaffold exhibits multi&#8208;scale anisotropic gradient structure from 5nm to 2cm, marking the first successful integration of multi&#8208;scale anisotropy with continuous gradient structures. More importantly, this method constructed a tough gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel scaffold with a strength of 12.67 MPa, which increased by 937 times (13.5 kPa to 12.67 MPa). This study proposes a novel method for constructing bio&#8208;grade gradient hydrogel scaffolds, paving the way for new avenues in engineering biomimetic tissue scaffolds.

         <title>Localized Water Confinement via Micellar Electrolyte for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized water confinement in the CTAB micellar electrolyte prevents cascade failure of vanadium&#8208;based AZIBs. The CTA+&#8208;expanded cathode spacing and CTA+/OTF&#8722;&#8208;formed EDL synergistically enhance pseudocapacitance of cathode and compensate for proton kinetic losses in the passivated electrolyte. Significantly, the balance between localized water confinement and rapid charge transfer enhances the cycle life of vanadium&#8208;based AZIBs at lower currents.








Abstract
Highly reactive water&#8208;induced cascade failures, including vanadium dissolution, proton intercalation, hydrogen evolution reactions, and interfacial side reactions, limit the recyclability of vanadium&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. These failures are more severe at low current densities (&lt; 0.5 A g&#8722;1). Current studies on electrolyte optimization stabilize the zinc anode but neglect the vanadium&#8208;based cathode. Here, from a vanadium&#8208;based cathode perspective, a micellar electrolyte is developed using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in which water is locally confined and Br&#8722; restructures Zn2+ solvation, collectively inhibiting the water&#8208;induced cascade failures. Concomitantly, electrostatic interactions enable CTA&#8314; intercalation into V&#9472;O layers (forming expanded&#8208;spacing cathode (CTA, Ca)VO) and cathode&#8208;surface electric double layer generation, which enhances pseudocapacitance to offset water confinement&#8208;induced kinetic losses. Additionally, cycling&#8208;induced CTA+ degradation participates in the formation of solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) to provide further effective cathode/anode interfacial protection. The micellar electrolyte balances water confinement and charge transfer to achieve breakthrough full&#8208;cell performance: 93.57%/98.78%/82.17% retention after 150/300/17 700 cycles at 0.1/0.2/4.0 A g&#8722;1 (25&#160;&#176;C) and 99.77% retention after 420 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C). This micellar electrolyte strategy can be extended to other vanadium&#8208;based cathodes (e.g., NaVO, BaVO), quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells, and anode&#8208;free cells, providing a viable paradigm for electrolyte design.

This micellar electrolyte strategy can be extended to other vanadium-based cathodes (e.g., NaVO, BaVO), quasi-solid-state cells, and anode-free cells, providing a viable paradigm for electrolyte design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft and Strong: Elastic Conductors with Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general reverse&#8208;engineering approach is demonstrated for designing functional yarns that uses woven fabric architecture as a structural framework. The fabric&#8208;based stretchable conductive yarns combine flexibility, high elasticity, low stiffness, self&#8208;protection, and weavability with conventional textile processes. By fine&#8208;tuning the number of elastic fibers and electrode fibers, this fabric&#8208;based approach enables customized tuning of strain sensitivity in stretchable conductive yarns.








Abstract
Skin is soft yet strong &#8211; a combination achieved by integrating compliant elastin with stiff but wavy collagen, producing non&#8208;linear mechanical properties. Inspired by this structure, stiff conductive wires are engineered into sinusoidal patterns and mechanically interlocked them with highly elastic fibers using a reimagined woven fabric approach. The result is a highly conducting and stretchable yarn that also has high tensile strength &#8211; a combination that is attractive for wearable applications where comfort and durability are valued. With a diameter of &#8776;1 mm&#8212;comparable to many commercial yarns&#8212;the fabric&#8208;based yarn exhibits low stiffness across a broad strain range (up to 270% under 2 N of force) while demonstrating a self&#8208;protective transition to high stiffness and strength (up to 30 MPa) as it nears failure. Additionally, this yarn offers excellent flexibility, high strain tolerance (exceeding 500%), inherent breathability, and superior weavability. By tuning the number of elastic fibers and electrode fibers, it can further tailor these stretchable conductive yarns into strain&#8208;insensitive connecting yarns (low impedance at MHz frequencies, GF = 0.0003) and mechanical sensing yarns with dual strain and proximity sensing capabilities. The integration of these functional yarns enables system&#8208;level smart textile applications, such as wristband controllers.

         <title>Carrier Diffusion Links Single Crystal Quality and Photoluminescence in Halide Perovskite Radiation Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tracking bulk carrier diffusion both vertically and laterally, this study links photoluminescence behavior to crystal quality in CsPbBr3 &#947;&#8208;ray detectors. Vertical diffusion governs spectral redshift, with high&#8208;quality crystals exhibiting superior transport, while two&#8208;photon microscopy reveals microscale defects that hinder diffusion in low&#8208;quality crystals. These insights provide a quantitative framework for screening and optimizing crystals for radiation detection.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next&#8208;generation radiation detectors, echoing their transformative impact on photovoltaics. Due to the long penetration depths of X&#8208;rays and &#947;&#8208;rays, thick single crystals are required to sufficiently attenuate the radiation, making bulk crystal quality critical for device performance. Photoluminescence properties, particularly long lifetimes and redshifted emission peaks, are commonly used as proxies for identifying high&#8208;quality CsPbBr3 crystals for high&#8208;performance detectors, yet the physical origin of this correlation remains unclear. Here, complementary photoluminescence techniques with a full&#8208;spectrum fit are combined to reveal the importance of vertical diffusion in governing photoluminescence response, ultimately shaping detector performance. High&#8208;quality crystals exhibit larger vertical diffusion coefficients (up to 0.65 cm2 s&#8722;1) and lower recombination rates (down to 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1), leading to diffusion lengths up to 5 times greater than those in low&#8208;quality crystals. Using one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon photoluminescence microscopy, microscale defects are further visualized, with suppressed redshift and distributions throughout the bulk, in low&#8208;quality crystals. Two&#8208;photon diffusion mapping directly reveals how these defects hinder carrier transport. These findings establish a direct link between photoluminescence and carrier diffusion, providing a quantitative framework that connects crystal quality to charge transport and device performance in perovskite radiation detectors.

         <title>Viologen Derivatives in Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes viologen derivatives in AORFBs, detailing their unique advantages, key challenges, and recent molecular and systems&#8208;level mitigation strategies. It further discusses advances in in situ and ex situ characterization that deepen understanding of redox mechanisms and degradation pathways, outlines practical considerations and future directions for developing durable, high&#8208;performance systems suitable for large&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting increasing attention as intrinsically safe and scalable solutions for grid&#8208;level energy storage. Among various organic anolytes, viologens stand out for their tunable structures, two&#8208;electron redox behavior, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis from abundant precursors. This review comprehensively summarizes recent progress in viologen&#8208;based AORFBs, highlighting their core advantages and central role in defining system performance. The major challenges that currently limit practical application are critically analyzed, including molecular permeation, radical cation aggregation, two&#8208;electron transfer limitations, and alkalization&#8208;induced degradation. Strategies designed to address these limitations are then discussed, such as bipolar molecule design, conjugation extension, steric and size engineering, complexation, and substituent modification, emphasizing how tailored structural features can synergistically improve anolyte stability, solubility, and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, complementary in situ and ex situ characterization techniques have deepened understanding of redox mechanisms, degradation pathways, and aggregation states under operational conditions. Looking ahead, advancing viologen&#8208;based AORFBs will rely on designing stable, high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, achieving efficient two&#8208;electron cycling, and integrating artificial intelligence&#8208;guided molecular design to accelerate discovery. Together, these efforts aim to enable durable, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems and bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial application.

         <title>Synergistic Hollow Structure Design and Defect Engineering in Dandelion&#8208;Like &#945;&#8208;MnO2 for Superior Radar&#8208;Infrared Compatible Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a design of defect&#8208;manipulated &#945;&#8208;MnO2 featuring dandelion&#8208;like hollow nanoarchitectures, the remarkably broadband microwave absorption (8.9&#160;GHz at 2.7&#160;mm, RL&#8592;10&#160;dB) and thermal conductivity (0.31&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) are simultaneously achieved for the as&#8208;filled single coating layer. Therefore, this study presents a groundbreaking solution to address the inherent microwave absorption incompatibility of conventional thermal insulation coatings, offering a bright new design strategy in exploring next&#8208;generation multispectral stealth materials.








Abstract
Radar&#8208;infrared compatible materials have emerged as a pivotal research focus on developing next&#8208;generation multispectral stealth technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;performance compatible stealth in a single integrated coating remains a significant challenge. This study proposes the design of a unique ion&#8208;modulated &#945;&#8208;MnO2 with a dandelion&#8208;like hollow structure, which functions as a promising filler to achieve superior radar&#8208;infrared compatible stealth property in a single&#8208;layer coating using epoxy resin as the binder. The intriguing phenomenon is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of multitiered hollowness and defects induced by low&#8208;valence cation doping, which enhance polarization loss behaviors and further reduce thermal conductivity. As a result, the remarkably broadband microwave absorption (RL&#8592;10&#160;dB) of 8.9&#160;GHz is achieved, covering most of X/Ku bands. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of the coating is prominently reduced from 0.59 to 0.31&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, with actual thermal radiation signals being visually suppressed. Therefore, this work presents a significant solution to address the inherent microwave absorption incompatibility of conventional thermal insulation coatings, offering a new strategy in exploring advanced multispectral stealth materials.

MXene and MBene nanomaterials show significant potential in addressing critical challenges in biomedicine, applied biology, agriculture, and the environment. From a nano&#8208;agricultural perspective, this relatively young field has witnessed emerging advances towards applications for plant&#8208;immunoengineering, biostimulation, and controlled delivery/sustained release of agrochemicals. These strategies encompass the design, fabrication, surface modification, and post&#8208;functionalization of MXene/MBene&#8208;based biomaterials, enabling the enhancement of plant defense mechanisms against biotic/abiotic stresses, as well as the promotion of growth for high&#8208;yield production to reduce the reliance on agrochemical inputs and alleviate their risks to human health and the environment. This innovative review presents comprehensive discussions on the proposed mechanisms, modes of action, biocompatibility, and future outlooks.








Abstract
Producing quality food crops with a focus on climate and environmental improvement policies has become central to modern farming and sustainability strategies. However, the rising world population and food demand have region&#8208;dependently pushed these boundaries to the overuse of agrochemical inputs. These include plant antimicrobials, pesticides, and soil fertilizers, applied to boost crop yields, reaching a critical juncture. The reliance on agrochemicals has been proven effective in priming, plant growth, and enhancing defense/resistance to biotic stressors, such as phytopathogens and invasive organisms, as well as abiotic pressures, including heat, drought, salinity, and light stress, by increasing nutrient absorption and innate immunity or adaptive stress resistance. However, increasing concerns about the safety, cost, and environmental impact of agrochemicals have intensified the necessity for applying sustainable precision technologies. Nano&#8208;agriculture has introduced emerging possibilities for utilizing low&#8208;dimensional biomaterials for plant protection/stimulation applications, once these technologies are proven safe. Among them, carbon&#8208;based MXenes and derivatives (MBenes) show potential due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume area, biocompatibility at controlled doses, and tunable physicochemical/biological properties. These unique specifications support targeted delivery and sustained release, while also enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance. This comprehensive review covers their effect on seed germination, seedling maturation, plant&#8208;immunoengineering, priming, eliciting, stomatal closure, antimicrobial actions, and gene or phytohormone regulation. It also discusses their role as sustainable carriers for the delivery and release of agrochemicals and plant protection by nano&#8208;design, aiming to reduce agrochemical consumption. Lastly, we discuss the current environmental regulations for nanomaterials and recommend rational outlooks for future work.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Stabilized Superfine Pt Clusters Synergized with Single&#8208;Atom Ni&#8208;N4 Sites for Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt cluster and Ni single&#8208;atom composite systems are constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support for boosting hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution. The as&#8208;prepared electrocatalyst exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity, which requires an ultralow cell voltage of a mere 79&#160;mV to reach the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting electrolyzer.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution represents a promising avenue for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the development of bifunctional catalysts with high atom economy and durability for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains challenging. Here, a design is reported that combines sulfur&#8208;stabilized Pt clusters and Ni&#8208;N4 sites on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Ptn&#8208;S/Ni1&#8208;NC) for boosting alkaline hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pre&#8208;coordinated sulfur atoms on Pt clusters provide strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) for the homogeneous distribution of Pt clusters, allowing Pt clusters to remain ultrafine, which ensures high atom utilization and sufficient active sites. Moreover, the electronic interactions and synergistic adsorption mechanism of Pt clusters and adjacent Ni&#8208;N4 sites markedly accelerate the H2O dissociation and HzOR kinetics. As a result, the Ptn&#8208;S/Ni1&#8208;NC catalysts exhibit exceptional catalytic activity, achieving an ultrasmall HER overpotential of 19&#160;mV and an ultralow HzOR working potential of &#8722;21&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density. In addition, the overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer can reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a low cell voltage of 79&#160;mV and good long&#8208;term stability in 1.0&#160;m KOH/0.5&#160;m N2H4.

         <title>Engineered Crystalline Heterostructure Interphase Enabling Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes with Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triple&#8208;phase Ag/Ag2Na/Na3PO4 protection layer is fabricated via an in situ reaction between Ag3PO4 and sodium metal. This robust interphase suppresses dendrite growth by combining strong sodiphilicity, high conductivity, and reduced ion diffusion barriers. It enables uniform sodium deposition/stripping, enhancing cycling stability and performance of sodium metal anodes.








Abstract
The advancement of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) critically depends on the development of stable sodium metal anodes (SMAs). However, practical implementation remains hindered by uncontrollable dendritic growth and uneven Na stripping/plating behavior associated with pristine sodium metal. In this study, the design of a robust triphasic heterojunction artificial interphase is reported, formed via a spontaneous in situ reaction between Ag3PO4 and metallic sodium. The resulting Ag2Na/Ag/Na3PO4 interphase synergistically combines metallic, alloy, and ionic phases to simultaneously regulate ion transport and suppress dendrite formation. Specifically, the Ag2Na alloy and metallic Ag components ensure strong interfacial adhesion and enhanced electronic conductivity, while the Na3PO4 phase promotes homogeneous Na&#8314; ion flux and accelerates surface diffusion via its desolvation capability. Benefiting from this engineered interface, the Na/Ag3PO4 anode exhibits a remarkably low nucleation overpotential of 27 mV and delivers stable cycling performance exceeding 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 (1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells. Moreover, a full sodium metal pouch cell incorporating the Na/Ag3PO4 anode achieves a high energy density of 425.5 Wh kg&#8722;1, underscoring the practical viability of this interfacial design for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Targeted Lipid Transfer Nanoshuttle via Lipid&#8208;Specific Transcytosis Induces Atherosclerotic Plaque Regression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) naturally facilitate lipid transport between membranes. The lipid&#8208;capturing shuttle (LipShuttle)&#160;mimics this activity by targeted lipid extraction and transcytosis&#8208;mediated lipid export, resulting in reversing lipid overload and reprogramming lipid catabolism of foam cells. Consequently, LipShuttle&#8208;based lipid transfer therapy promotes atherosclerosis regression by reducing lipid accumulation, exerting anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, and inducing a pro&#8208;efferocytic phenotype.








Abstract
Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) orchestrate inter&#8208;membrane lipid transport through hydrophobic cavities, but their therapeutic application is limited by the requirement to simultaneously maintain dual&#8208;membrane targeting and lipid&#8208;carrying structures. Inspired by LTPs, a therapeutic platform coupling &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) with gold nanoparticles as a lipid&#8208;capturing shuttle (LipShuttle) is proposed. The &#946;&#8208;CD specifically targets lipid droplets to sequester stored lipids, while the gold nanoparticles drive transcytotic lipid efflux. This dual mechanism enhances lipid removal, boosts neutral lipid catabolism, and reverses lipid overload in foam cells. Then LipShuttle's therapeutic efficacy is validated in high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed ApoE&#8722;/&#8722; mice with established atherosclerotic plaques. By combining ultrasound&#8208;enhanced lipid efflux with cell targeting, LipShuttle promotes plaque regression and reduces vulnerability. Mechanistically, LipShuttle&#8208;mediated lipid depletion suppresses arachidonic acid metabolism, attenuating inflammation, and reprograms plaque macrophages toward a pro&#8208;efferocytic phenotype. This dual action promotes plaque regression, demonstrating a promising lipid transfer&#8208;based therapeutic strategy for diseases driven by dysregulated lipid accumulation.

Abstract
The urgent need for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries has propelled the development of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries (RT&#8208;NSBs), which leverage earth&#8208;abundant elements to offer a high theoretical energy density. However, the practical realization of RT&#8208;NSBs is severely constrained by formidable challenges originating at the electrolyte, primarily the detrimental polysulfide shuttle effect, the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Addressing these intertwined issues through rational electrolyte design is paramount for unlocking the potential of this technology. This review offers a comprehensive comparison of liquid, gel polymer, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes for RT&#8208;NSBs, establishing a mechanistic framework that connects solvation chemistry, interfacial reactions, and electrochemical behavior to actionable electrolyte design principles. The fundamental operating principles and key challenges are first outlined. Subsequently, a systematic overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies across different electrolyte platforms is presented, emphasizing the underlying mechanisms and notable achievements. Furthermore, the pivotal role of advanced characterization techniques in elucidating complex solvation structures, electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and sulfur redox pathways is discussed to accelerate the rational design of electrolytes. Finally, this review points out the remaining challenges and potential directions to accelerate the transition of RT&#8208;NSBs into practical, next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Template Vertical Epitaxial Growth of 2D Stacked Organic Cocrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the high interfacial compatibility between BTB and NTB cocrystals, OSHs are successfully constructed using a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase method. Through cocrystal engineering, BTB (001) surface was constructed as a template, and vertical epitaxial growth of NTB molecules was induced by motif&#8208;based assembly to form 2D OSHs. This work provides new ideas for the design and construction of epitaxial heterostructures. 








Abstract
2D organic stacked heterostructures (2D OSHs) have become an ideal material for developing on&#8208;chip integrated optoelectronic devices due to their unique interlayer coupling effects and interface engineering potentials. However, achieving a controlled synthesis of 2D OSHs remains challenging due to the inherent difficulty of regulating organic molecular orientations and overcoming thermodynamic barriers. Herein, a cocrystal engineering&#8208;based template method is reported, where cocrystals are engineered into 2D templates to induce vertical epitaxial growth of other cocrystals, enabling the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D OSHs. The thickness ratio of two layers can be precisely regulated and exhibits a continuously tunable emission from yellow to blue, where the OSHs with the ratio of 0.25 exhibit near&#8208;white emission (CIE: 0.33, 0.35). In addition, the OSHs exhibit excellent dual&#8208;band optical waveguide performance. This work provides a new synthesis method for OSH's functional integrated materials in the fields of optical displays and waveguides, promoting their application in the next generation of integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Harnessing Self&#8208;Sensitized Scintillation by Supramolecular Engineering of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals in Dense Mesoporous Template Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals exhibit bright emission, fast response, and solution processability, but their nanoscale size limits efficient radiation detection. Organizing them into porous SiO2 mesospheres enhances radioluminescence up to 40 times, achieving an optimal combination of light yield, fast scintillation, and processability, providing a pathway to high&#8208;performance, versatile nanoscintillators for imaging, space, and high&#8208;energy physics.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based nanoscintillators, such as CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs), are emerging as promising candidates for ionizing radiation detection, thanks to their high emission efficiency, rapid response, and facile synthesis. However, their nanoscale dimensions &#8212; smaller than the mean free path of secondary carriers &#8212; and relatively low emitter density per unit volume, limited by their high molecular weight and reabsorption losses, restrict efficient secondary carrier conversion and hamper their practical deployment. In this work, a strategy is introduced to enhance scintillation performance by organizing NCs into densely packed domains within porous SiO2 mesospheres (MSNs). This engineered architecture achieves up to a 40&#8208;fold increase in radioluminescence intensity compared to colloidal NCs, driven by improved retention and conversion of secondary charges, as corroborated by electron release measurements. This approach offers a promising pathway toward developing next&#8208;generation nanoscintillators with enhanced performance, with potential applications in high&#8208;energy physics, medical imaging, and space technologies.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable, Ladder&#8208;Branched Polyimides of Intrinsic Microporosity by [4+4] Cycloaddition for Membrane Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy utilizing [4+4] cycloaddition is demonstrated to fabricate ladder&#8208;branched polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PIs) with significantly enhanced performance characteristics for membrane&#8208;based gas separation.








Abstract
Advancements in membrane&#8208;based gas separation have the potential to address global challenges related to energy and the environment. However, new membrane materials must have excellent separation performance, stability, and processability, and simultaneously achieving all three metrics is extremely challenging. To circumvent these issues, a post&#8208;synthetic modification of polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PIs) synthesized with a UV light (UV)&#8208;reactive anthracene co&#8208;monomer is reported. UV irradiation on the PIM&#8208;PI solution converts the anthracene units into dianthracene linkages by [4+4] cycloaddition, while the resultant PIM&#8208;PI is still solution&#8208;processable due to the branched structure. The ladder&#8208;like dianthracene moieties significantly increased both microporosity (&lt;20 &#197;) and ultramicroporosity (&lt;7 &#197;) of the precursor PIM&#8208;PI. Notably, the UV&#8208;treated PIM&#8208;PI membrane exhibits a large boost in pure&#8208;gas CO2 permeability by up to 260%, reaching 376 barrer, while maintaining CO2/CH4 ideal selectivity of 35 at 1 bar. Moreover, the developed membrane material has enhanced stability against physical aging and plasticization and showcases excellent CO2/CH4 mixed&#8208;gas selectivity (&gt;30 up to 31 bar feed pressure), which surpasses the 2018 mixed&#8208;gas upper bound.

         <title>Water Treatment for Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescent Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescent adhesives are developed via water&#8208;induced polymer chain reorganization. Their long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescent properties are extremely stable and can be long&#8208;term maintained, and can be employed to non&#8208;destructively and precisely monitor the sticking status.








Abstract
Polymer materials with long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising because they are easy to process to fit broad luminescent events. However, these systems typically rely on polar groups to form hydrogen or ionic bonds to confine chromophores to produce long&#8208;lived RTP. Such interactions are susceptible to moisture, which greatly limits the stability of such materials and their luminescent signals. Here, long&#8208;lived RTP adhesives are developed by random copolymerization of a trace amount of chromophores into polyacrylic acid. For these polymers, a water&#8208;induced polymer reorganization can be observed at room temperature to form protective confined regions for chromophores, resulting in an afterglow lifetime up to 3 s, with a high moisture tolerance threshold. The strategy is applicable to diverse chromophores, resulting in RTP with a wide range of tunable emission colors. Meanwhile, these polymers are soluble in water and can be used as removable adhesives. The long&#8208;lived RTP can be employed to monitor sticking status non&#8208;destructively and precisely, which can inspire the development of high&#8208;performance RTP polymers for unprecedented practical applications.

         <title>Tilted Crack&#8208;Engineered Photothermal Membranes Achieve Attenuation&#8208;Free Solar Evaporation and Oil Recovery From Emulsions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tilted solar evaporation membrane with a cracked metal&#8211;phenolic coating for simultaneous water and oil recovery from emulsions. The cracked coating can optimize water supply pathways on the membrane and modulate water&#8208;water interactions, leading to a high evaporation rate. Tilted design prevents oil droplet adhesion and realizes oil collection, ensuring durable performance for continuous operation.








Abstract
While solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) presents a sustainable solution for water purification, its application to challenging oily wastewater has been severely limited by inadequate water transport, oil&#8208;fouling&#8208;induced evaporation attenuation, and the inability to efficiently recover oil. To overcome these fundamental barriers, a novel tilted photothermal membrane featuring cracked metal&#8211;phenolic networks (C&#8208;MPNs) integrated with an oil collector for simultaneous solar&#8208;driven recovery of both water and oil from emulsions is introduced. Through synergistic material and interfacial engineering, the unique C&#8208;MPNs&#160;structure enhances water evaporation by dual mechanisms: 1) modulating water&#8211;water interactions via tannic acid molecules and 2) optimizing water transport pathways via engineered cracks. This design achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, ranking among the top&#8208;performing photothermal membranes. Critically, the network of cracks generates abundant submicron gates that selectively intercept oil droplets. Coupled with the tilted configuration, this system actively transports intercepted oil upward for efficient capture (90.6% recovery) while concurrently mitigating membrane fouling. Remarkably, the integrated system maintains an unprecedented evaporation rate of 2.6 kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 for soybean oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with zero attenuation over 42 h of continuous operation. Extended outdoor testing over 23 days confirms exceptional operational stability and sustained, high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;resource recovery.

         <title>Liberating Ca2+ Storage from Lattices: Amorphous FePOx Unveiling an Inside&#8208;Out Adaptive Cathode Paradigm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous FePOx enables superior Ca2+ storage through an internal&#8208;to&#8208;surface adaptive mechanism. Liberated from crystalline constraints, its flexible framework &#8220;volume breathing&#8221; effectively accommodating volume changes during Ca2+ cycling. During Ca2+ extraction, vacancies condense into nanopores that migrate to the surface, driven by thermodynamic imperatives to minimize energy. This self&#8208;optimization creates a textured, curvature&#8208;rich interface with continuously evolving ion pathways.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) offer a promising candidate within multivalent&#8208;ion batteries (MVIBs), but their advancement is impeded by the lack of cathode materials capable of efficiently accommodating large Ca2+ with rapid kinetics. Here, this study demonstrates how amorphous FePOx effectively liberates Ca2+ storage from such lattice restrictions by virtue of its inherently disordered and flexible framework, unveiling an adaptive storage mechanism in two distinct yet correlated aspects. First, its amorphous network not only revives electrochemical activity but also provides more open and isotropic ion transport pathways compared to rigid crystalline structures, enabling superior internal Ca2+ accommodation and yielding the optimal Ca2+ diffusion coefficient (3.24 &#215; 10&#8722;9 cm2 s&#8722;1) among the current CIBs inorganic cathode materials. Then, this inherent structural flexibility within the amorphous network further enables dynamic surface self&#8208;optimization process of amorphous FePOx via void migration from Ca2+ extraction. The evolving surface morphology provides more Ca2+ adsorption sites, enhancing decalciation/calciation kinetics. This synergistic adaptation yields a high capacity (124.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional cyclability (92.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles), and high rate (&#8776;76% retention rate when increasing from 20 to 300&#160;mA g&#8722;1), demonstrating the broad advantages of amorphous architectures for advanced MVIBs.

         <title>Critical Thickness and Long&#8208;Term Ambient Stability in Superconducting LaPr2Ni2O7 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity persisting over 100 days is achieved in 11.8&#160;nm LaPr2Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Structural and transport analyses reveal spontaneous formation of a protective (La,Pr)4Ni3O10&#8208;dominant surface phase (&gt;10&#160;nm from the interface) that stabilizes superconductivity. Additional ex situ amorphous oxide capping further enhances ambient stability, marking a significant advance toward durable bilayer nickelate superconductors.








Abstract
The recent observation of ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity in compressively strained (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 films marks a significant advance in nickelate superconductivity research. However, their fabrication remains challenging, with reported thickness limited to &lt;6.6&#160;nm and pronounced ambient degradation. In this study, LaPr2Ni2O7 films with nominal thicknesses ranging from 3.5 to 23.5&#160;nm are fabricated. Superconductivity is observed in all samples, with a maximum onset transition temperature (Tc) of 44 K. No systematic correlation between Tc and film thickness is identified. Angle&#8208;dependent Tc measurements under external magnetic fields and vortex anisotropy analysis indicate 2D superconductivity in all samples. Structural and transport measurements show that superconductivity in LaPr2Ni2O7 is confined to within 10&#160;nm of the interface, while thicker films develop a protective (La,Pr)4Ni3O10 surface layer that enhances stability. Ex situ amorphous oxide capping layers further suppress superconducting degradation, yielding 10&#8208;fold stability enhancement in ultrathin films (3 &#8776; 4&#160;nm) and prolonging stability from 30 to more than 100 days in thicker films.

         <title>Polyurethane Nonwovens Integrated with Nanocomposite as Twist&#8208;Assisted Healing Flexible Sensor for Ultrasensitive Room&#8208;Temperature NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a twist&#8208;assisted healing flexible NO2 sensor by integrating Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT@rGO on PU nonwoven. The sensor achieves ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, rapid response, and exceptional humidity resistance, as well as good mechanical robustness. Remarkably, fractured sensors restore functionality via twist&#8208;assisted healing. Integrated into wearable devices, it enables real&#8208;time gas monitoring in harsh conditions.








Abstract
A twist&#8208;assisted healing flexible sensor for ultrasensitive and selective detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at room temperature is developed by sequentially introducing the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto polyurethane (PU) nonwovens as the conducting medium, followed by decoration with the Au/Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and polythiophene (Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT) composites as the pivotal sensing layer. The optimized Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT@rGO@PU sensor exhibits outstanding performance across a wide NO2 concentration range (0.1&#8211;800&#160;ppm), demonstrating improved sensitivity (&#8776;27% to 1&#160;ppm), rapid response /recovery characteristics (7&#160;s/38&#160;s), ultralow detection limit (2&#160;ppb), and exceptional selectivity at 28&#160;&#176;C. Such superior NO2 sensing can be ascribed to the synergistic effect: the outer PEDOT coating exposes numerous sensing sites, the Au/Pd NPs exert excellent catalysis, and the rGO framework accelerates the charge transfer. More importantly, the sensor demonstrates remarkable mechanical properties, including good robustness, twist&#8208;assisted healing capability, and superior water resistance. Combining scalable fabrication, straightforward construction, and competitive detection metrics, this flexible sensor represents a promising platform for real NO2 monitoring applications.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Design of L12&#8208;Type Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Compound for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15 quinary L12&#8208;type Pt3M(4) high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds are designed, train a deep neural network to predict hydrogen adsorption energies across 20&#8201;000 microstates per composition, and establish a novel statistical evaluation framework by quantifying microstates within the active range. Site&#8208;specific analysis reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;Pt configurations.








Abstract
Rational design of high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEICs) remains challenging due to complex structure&#8208;property relationships and the lack of predictive tools. Here, a data&#8208;driven framework is presented to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of L12&#8208;type quinary Pt3M(4) HEICs, where M comprises any four elements from six 3d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn). Guided by the Pm&#8208;3m space group, 15 distinct compositions with numerous microstates are designed. A deep neural network, trained on 453 computed datasets, predicts hydrogen adsorption energy (&#8710;EH*) across 20&#8201;000 microstructures per composition, enabling statistical mapping of site&#8208;specific performance. To capture the effect of local atomic environments, a novel statistical evaluation approach is introduced that quantifies the number of microstates falling within the optimal &#8710;EH* range, advancing beyond conventional mean&#8208;based evaluations. Among all candidates, Pt3(CrMnFeCo) emerges as the most promising HER catalyst, validated experimentally over a wide pH range. Further in&#8208;depth data mining reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;Pt interactions. This study establishes a new paradigm for HEIC catalyst design and deepens the mechanistic understanding of activity origin in complex multimetal systems.

         <title>Reticular Frameworks for Advanced Polymer Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular frameworks (RFs) such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks offer versatile platforms for polymer materials innovation, enabling regulated polymerization, efficient macromolecular purification, and polymer functionalization. This review highlights recent achievements and prospects in creating advanced polymers using RFs, paving the way for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
This review article aims to explore the innovative applications of reticular frameworks (RFs), particularly metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, for the development of advanced polymers. RFs, characterized by their crystalline porous structures and tunable properties, have significant advantages in polymer production and functionalization, improving their synthetic efficiency, structural regularity, stability, conductivity, mechanical properties, and overall performance through a combination of structural characteristics. Ordered nanopores in RFs act as structural scaffolds, guiding polymerization with spatial precision and enabling control over polymer structures and arrangement. RFs exhibit exceptional potential for macromolecular recognition and separation, affording scalable platforms for highly selective polymer processing and purification. Synergistic coupling of reticular chemistry with polymer engineering opens new avenues for the design of next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, recent developments in the synthesis of polymers in RFs, the separations and recognitions of polymers by RFs, and RF&#8211;polymer hybrids are evaluated, which further present a forward&#8208;looking perspective. The rapid progress in this field has led to breakthroughs in both fundamental science and materials applications, promoting future investigations to expand their potential in creating advanced polymer materials.

         <title>Touch&#8208;Driven Bi&#8208;Chiral Superstructures for Nested Encryption of Multiplexed Optical Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A touch&#8208;driven nested optical encryption system is proposed via a bi&#8208;chiral superstructure. Structural colors and vectorial holography are combined with precise control of Bragg reflection to encode information in multiple optical dimensions. A four&#8208;step decryption process involving human touch enables interactive access. This advances on&#8208;demand construction of chiral superstructures, and opens a new way for high&#8208;security and high&#8208;capacity optical informatics.








Abstract
With the growing demand for data security, optical encryption has emerged as a promising solution due to its high&#8208;speed, parallel and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption characteristics. However, most optical encryption methods rely on static structures involved with only few optical degrees of freedom (DOFs), resulting in simple encryption methods susceptible to attacks. Herein, a dynamic nested optical encryption scheme is proposed using a touch&#8208;driven bi&#8208;chiral cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) superstructure, where relief&#8208;structured polymerized CLCs are combined with temperature&#8208;sensitive opposite&#8208;handed CLCs. Through delicate photopatterning and Bragg reflection engineering, independent geometric phases can be induced to the reflected light with orthogonal circular polarization and multiple wavelengths. Thus, various optical DOFs (wavelength, amplitude, and polarization) and environmental factors (temperature or human&#8208;device interaction) are encoded as different encryption dimensions. Based on the developed four&#8208;step encryption algorithm, the four&#8208;level nested encryption is demonstrated by multiplexing the plaintext and multilevel ciphertexts in structural colors, multicolored vectorial holography and their temperature&#8208;driven variations. The plaintext can be derived only through a specific order, with the final step completed by a human touch. This work advances the on&#8208;demand construction of chiral nanostructures, and offers a new paradigm for high&#8208;security and high&#8208;capacity optical informatics.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Hydrophilic Layers for Moisture&#8208;Introduced Hybrid Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a hybrid hygroelectric generator with enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport and ion migration in the multilayer structure. The device achieves a high voltage above 1.4 V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra&#8208;high current of 1.15 mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) at 85% relative humidity.








Abstract
Hygroelectricity, converting chemical potential energy of abundant moisture from the atmosphere into electricity, is one of the most promising technologies in the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable energy. Here, a uniquely designed hygroelectric generator is proposed with a stable self&#8208;maintained water gradient and enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport in the multilayer structure, which boosts voltage and current outputs simultaneously as well as demonstrates a low environmental reliance. The devised multilayer structure facilitates charge separation of functional groups and boosts interfacial reactions with top electrodes, which first enabled a high voltage above 1.4&#160;V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra&#8208;high current of 1.15&#160;mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) at 85% relative humidity due to hybrid energy contribution. The rechargeable moisture battery is achieved based on a hygroelectric generator and delivered a high Coulombic efficiency of 106%. The hygroelectric devices with high outputs are integrated into the self&#8208;powered systems to charge a commercial mobile phone and achieve wearable human activity monitoring. Therefore, this work opens a bright prospect in achieving extremely high outputs with a low environmental reliance for sustainable energy generation systems.

         <title>Facilely Accessible and Reusable High&#8208;Performance Poly(Thioester Amide) Adhesives with Exceptional Versatility and Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of poly(thioester amide) adhesives is facilely synthesized via spontaneous ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;alkyl aziridine and glutaric thioanhydride. In particular, the polymer with rigid benzyl side groups exhibits high&#8208;performance adhesion to diverse substrates, along with excellent reusability and resistance to low temperatures and water, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional adhesives in line with circular economy principles.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in adhesive technology, developing adhesives that combine strong adhesion with reusability remains a formidable challenge. Current commercial adhesives often fail under cold or humid conditions, highlighting the need for next&#8208;generation systems with enhanced environmental resilience and reusability. In this study, a facile and robust polymer adhesive is developed and synthesized via the spontaneous, catalyst&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of N&#8208;alkyl aziridine and glutaric thioanhydride (GTA). The resulting cyclic alternating poly(thioester amide)s (PTEAs), particularly P(AzBn&#8208;GTA) derived from N&#8208;benzylaziridine (AzBn) and GTA, exhibit versatile adhesion across various substrates, including dissimilar materials, with a maximum adhesion strength of 17.8 MPa on steel. By introducing multiple interaction sites and tailoring side groups, a well&#8208;balanced combination of cohesive and interfacial adhesion energies is achieved, conferring the polymers with exceptional elasticity and toughness. Moreover, the incorporation of flexible backbones and hydrophobic moieties imparts remarkable resistance to ultralow temperature and water. Reversible adhesion is demonstrated through simple heating and cooling cycles, with stable performance maintained over 10 reprocessing cycles. Overall, the high performance and reusability of P(AzBn&#8208;GTA) surpass those of previously reported adhesives, positioning it as an advanced and sustainable alternative aligned with circular economy principles.

The resulting cyclic alternating poly(thioester amide)s (PTEAs), particularly P(Az&lt;sup&gt;Bn&lt;/sup&gt;-GTA) derived from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzylaziridine (Az&lt;sup&gt;Bn&lt;/sup&gt;) and GTA, exhibit versatile adhesion across various substrates, including dissimilar materials, with a maximum adhesion strength of 17.8 MPa on steel. By introducing multiple interaction sites and tailoring side groups, a well-balanced combination of cohesive and interfacial adhesion energies is achieved, conferring the polymers with exceptional elasticity and toughness. Moreover, the incorporation of flexible backbones and hydrophobic moieties imparts remarkable resistance to ultralow temperature and water. Reversible adhesion is demonstrated through simple heating and cooling cycles, with stable performance maintained over 10 reprocessing cycles. Overall, the high performance and reusability of P(Az&lt;sup&gt;Bn&lt;/sup&gt;-GTA) surpass those of previously reported adhesives, positioning it as an advanced and sustainable alternative aligned with circular economy principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HZO/HSO Superlattice ReFET Array Integrating Optical Sensing for Neuromorphic Vision Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic ReFET array with an engineered HZO&#8211;HSO superlattice enables monolithic integration of optical sensing, nonvolatile memory, and synaptic computation. It exhibits forming&#8208;free, &gt;8&#8208;bit analog states, &gt;1010 endurance cycles, and light&#8208;tunable conductance. Integrated into a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, it achieves 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST in an in&#8208;sensor vision transformer.








Abstract
Neuromorphic vision systems require artificial synapses that integrate sensing, memory, and computation with high precision and stability. Conventional memristors face limitations including forming requirements, few multilevel states, low endurance, and poor integration density, while ferroelectric and flash&#8208;based transistors suffer trade&#8208;offs among endurance, retention, and switching ratio, and generally lack intrinsic photonic sensitivity, constraining in&#8208;sensor computing. Here, a photonic resistive&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor (ReFET) array is presented that combines optical sensing, forming&#8208;free multilevel memory, and analog computation in a single device. The ReFET employs a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Hf0.95Sr0.05O2 (HZO/HSO) superlattice gate and an amorphous InGaZnO (IGZO) channel, achieving 272 stable conductance states (&gt;8&#8208;bit) in a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, ON/OFF ratios &gt;10&#8310;, endurance &gt;1010 cycles, and retention &gt;10&#8310;&#160;s. The array functions as an in&#8208;sensor optical convolutional layer, performing multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations with 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST using 8&#8208;bit quantized weights, while delivering high energy efficiency. This platform enables scalable, high&#8208;precision, energy&#8208;efficient photonic neuromorphic computing, integrating sensing, memory, and computation in one architecture.

         <title>Catalysts for Electrochemical Oxidation of Ammonia: A Comprehensive Review of Fundamentals and Optimization Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing robust catalysts for ammonia electrochemical oxidation (AOR) is essential for advancing NH3 utilization technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in catalyst design and mechanistic understanding of AOR. In addition, it systematically investigates strategies to improve AOR performance for various types of catalysts. Finally, an outlook in multiple disciplines related to the future directions is presented.








Abstract
The realization of a hydrogen (H2) economy confronts formidable challenges in storage, transportation, and logistics. To address these challenges, H2 carriers have been proposed as alternative solutions. Ammonia (NH3), as one of the most promising H2 carriers, becomes a game&#8208;changer, offering higher volumetric H2 density than compressed H2, simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH3&#8217;s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H2 or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH3 electrolysis, and direct NH3 fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH3 oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity&#8208;governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH3&#8208;based technologies into the hydrogen economy.

         <title>Liquid Jet&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid jet triboelectric nanogenerator driven by Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PR&#8208;TENG) is devised. Compared with droplet and continuous water flow, the liquid jet exhibits enhanced charge transfer efficiency, delivering over two orders of magnitude higher current output. The mechanism originates from high&#8208;frequency contact, efficient electron capture, and droplet recontact&#8208;assisted charge release.








Abstract
Although the solid&#8211;liquid triboelectric nanogenerators have made great progress in energy harvesting, their efficiency is fundamentally limited by the continuous shielding effect of the solid&#8211;liquid electric double layer (EDL). Herein, a liquid&#8208;jet triboelectric nanogenerator that exploits Plateau&#8208;Rayleigh instability (PR&#8208;TENG) is demonstrated to overcome this barrier. PR&#8208;TENG converts low&#8208;frequency water flow into high&#8208;frequency droplets, avoiding shielding effects from continuous flow and achieving a contact&#8208;separation frequency of &#8776;50 Hz. At a flow rate of 320 mL&#160;min&#8722;1, the PR&#8208;TENG generates an output current of over 100 &#181;A, &#8776;120 times the magnitude of conventional single&#8208;electrode droplet TENGs (D&#8208;TENGs) that rely on electrostatic induction. The operational mechanism of PR&#8208;TENG arises from droplet&#8208;fusion&#8208;induced triboelectrification, surface charge trapping, and charge redistribution, enabling energy harvesting from continuous water flow and water&#8208;level monitoring applications. This work significantly improves the electrical output performance of flow&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators and provides an effective solution for continuous flow&#8208;based energy harvesting.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Noble Metal Nanocatalysts for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering, by precisely modulating the electronic structure of catalysts, serves as a pivotal strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. This review focuses on breakthrough strategies such as dynamic strain regulation and stabilization mechanisms, along with their applications in energy conversion reactions and future prospects.








Abstract
Strain engineering plays a pivotal role in optimizing noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts, which are essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. This review highlights recent breakthroughs extending beyond conventional approaches, focusing on two key innovations: 1) Core volume manipulation (CVM) in core&#8211;shell structures, enabling precise, dynamic, and reversible strain control via core contraction/expansion; 2) Stabilized strain architectures integrating strong interfacial interactions to construct exceptionally durable catalytic systems. CVM facilitates tunable strain, whereas strong interfacial interactions address strain relaxation crucially, ensuring long&#8208;term durability under harsh conditions. These advanced strategies deliver exceptional performance in key reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), achieving significant enhancements in mass activity and dramatically improved stability over benchmark catalysts. It is critically discuss how these complementary strategies, CVM for tunability and strong interfacial interactions for inherent stability, offer unprecedented control and durability. Finally, current challenges and future directions for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance, durable electrocatalysts are outlined.

In response to the dual challenges posed by global water scarcity and carbon neutrality targets, conventional desalination technologies struggle to satisfy the requirements of high energy consumption and inherent limitations associated with centralized water supply systems. Within this context, interfacial solar steam evaporation (ISSE) technology has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, owing to its advantages of highly efficient photothermal conversion, zero carbon emissions, and modular design. Although ISSE has been developed for tens of years, there are still many challenges to be faced, from fundamental research to practical applications. It is noticed that the energy conversion and mass transport are the core issues in multi&#8208;scale levels of ISSE, no matter of the material design or the system assembly, and the optimization of them is beneficial for the whole process of ISSE. Herein, the research progress is tried to understand and summarize from the material chosen, structural architecture, and system integration with the view of energy and mass transfer. Furthermore, the successful integration of thermoelectric conversion, simultaneous water&#8211;hydrogen cogeneration, and metal salt recovery has concurrently enhanced the efficiency of energy utilization. Furthermore, a collaborative operation framework integrating discrete water networks and ISSE technology has been predicted. Through AI empowerment and modularized design, it eventually forms a smart water cycle system with the trinity of &#8220;water collection&#8208;purification&#8208;cogeneration.&#8221; At the end of this review, the thoughts on the development of ISSE are also provided.

         <title>Expanded InSe Crystal Structure with Reduced Intrinsic Defects for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel InSe crystal grown on the China Space Station, exhibiting an expanded lattice structure and reduced defects. These lattice variations contribute to unique electronic characteristics and facilitate carrier transport, significantly boosting electrical and photoelectrical performance. The findings offer valuable insights for developing promising electronic materials in the post&#8208;Moore era.









Abstract
Intrinsic defect plays a crucial role in the electrical and photoelectrical performance of InSe&#8208;based FETs. Here, a space&#8208;growth InSe on China Space Station with reduced intrinsic defects is reported and high&#8208;performance InSe field&#8208;effect transistors are developed. Spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope analysis reveals that the space grown InSe presents lattice expansion of 1.29% along the intralayer direction (a,b plane) and 3.65% along the interlayer direction (c&#8208;axis). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the defect generation energy of expanded space InSe is larger than that of ground InSe, improving lattice integrity. The lattice variations in space InSe contribute to unique electronic properties with a narrower bandgap, smaller effective mass of electrons, and increased electronic states near the Fermi level, which reduces carrier scattering and facilitates electron transport. Space InSe FET presents better electrical characteristics (Ion of 6.0&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, on/off ratio of 108 and hysteresis voltage of 0.6&#160;V) and photoelectrical performance (responsivity of 5316&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.38 &#215; 1012 Jones) than the ground InSe FET, in which InSe is grown on the ground. This study provides unique insights into the investigation of crystal structure and promotes the development of high&#8208;performance 2D FETs.

         <title>Resolving the Structural Duality of Graphene Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cantilever ncAFM resolves the atomic structure of grain boundaries in graphene, revealing coexisting stable and metastable types. Both contain pentagon/heptagon defects, but metastable GBs show irregular geometries. Modeling shows metastable GBs form under compression, exhibiting vertical corrugation, while stable GBs are flat. Metastable GBs can be manipulated toward stability. Their localized distortions impact properties over extended scales.








Abstract
Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in large&#8208;scale graphene samples, playing a crucial role in their overall performance. Due to their complexity, they are usually investigated as model structures, under the assumption of a fully relaxed interface. Here, cantilever&#8208;based non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) is presented as a suitable technique to resolve, atom by atom, the complete structure of these linear defects. These experimental findings reveal a richer scenario than expected, with the coexistence of energetically stable and metastable graphene GBs. Although both GBs are structurally composed of pentagonal and heptagonal rings, they can be differentiated by the irregular geometric shapes present in the metastable boundaries. Theoretical modeling and simulated ncAFM images, accounting for the experimental data, show that metastable GBs form under compressive uniaxial strain and exhibit vertical corrugation, whereas stable GBs remain in a fully relaxed, flat configuration. By locally introducing energy with the AFM tip, the possibility of manipulating the metastable GBs, driving them toward their minimum energy configuration, is shown. Notably, the high&#8208;resolution ncAFM images reveal a clear dichotomy: while the structural distortions of metastable grain boundaries are confined to just a few atoms, their impact on graphene's properties extends over significantly larger length scales.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Urea Electrooxidation: From Mechanism to Catalysts and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), emphasizing molecular mechanisms, rational material design (doping, nanostructuring, defect and heterostructure engineering), and diverse engineering applications including urea sensors, hydrogen production, urea purification, and direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) under various pH conditions.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) serves as a pivotal process for sustainable wastewater remediation and renewable energy conversion, yet its practical implementation faces pH&#8208;dependent challenges that demand systematic understanding. This review comprehensively examines UOR mechanisms across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, elucidating fundamental correlations between pH environments, catalytic activity, and reaction pathways. While alkaline media enhance kinetics via adsorbate evolution mechanisms, they often induce catalyst structural reconstruction that undermines stability; conversely, neutral and acidic media suffer from kinetic limitations due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. Based on these insights, this review outlines several key optimization strategies for catalyst development, tailored to each pH environment, and explores the potential for scaling up alkaline UOR for energy&#8208;related applications. Finally, several critical future research directions that provide a roadmap for overcoming existing limitations and advancing UOR toward practical applications are proposed, which can serve as a timely framework for future developments in pH&#8208;tailored UOR systems of both environmental and energy sectors.

Abstract
X&#8208;ray detection technology utilizing scintillators is pivotal across various applications, including medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Recently, metal clusters have emerged as a novel class of scintillator materials, demonstrating promising potential in X&#8208;ray imaging due to their superior X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities, tunable optical properties, and excellent stability against moisture and oxygen. This review addresses the current lack of comprehensive evaluations in the domain of coinage metal cluster scintillators. It begins with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms and critical performance parameters of these scintillators. Subsequently, effective strategies to enhance scintillation performance are systematically summarized. The review also delves into various preparation methods for metal cluster scintillator screens. Lastly, it identifies the opportunities and challenges that the field currently faces. This review aims to serve as a theoretical foundation and a methodological guide for future studies focused on the structural design and performance optimization of coinage metal cluster scintillators, advancing X&#8208;ray imaging technologies to address application challenges in this evolving field.

The reaction heterogeneity is tailored precisely within Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, which not only helps alleviate the notorious oxygen release as well as parasitic interfacial side reactions, but also improve the Li+ diffusion kinetics by means of highly ordered cationic arrangement and enhanced mechanical stability, thereby boosting the electrochemical properties.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLO) cathode is hindered by severe capacity and voltage degradation resulting from severe oxygen release and irreversible phase transition. Herein, the reaction heterogeneity, which describes the spatially resolved electrochemical divergence within individual cathode particles, is engineered through compositional gradient design to couple Li+ transport kinetics and the anion redox activity between particle interiors and surfaces. It is revealed that Co/Mn concentration gradient within particles creates heterogeneous phase content distribution and structural ordering, inducing surface&#8208;bulk reaction heterogeneity that significantly impacts the overall electrochemical performance. Specifically, Li2MnO3&#8208;poor and Co&#8208;enriched surface effectively mitigates the oxygen loss and enhances electrochemical reaction kinetics, benefited from the reduced surface redox reactivity and induced highly ordered intra&#8208;layered cationic arrangement. Meanwhile, the Li2MnO3&#8208;enriched core with slight Li/Ni intermixing provides high reversible capacity and strong mechanical stability. Consequently, the greatly enhanced anion redox reversibility, Li+ diffusion dynamics, and structure stability endow LLO with exceptional electrochemical properties, showing a capacity retention of 86.0% and a reduced voltage decay of 0.518&#160;mV per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a valuable strategy to tailor the redox chemistry and achieve robust LLO.

         <title>Bidentate Anchoring Enables Concurrent Grain Orientation and Lattice Strain Mitigation in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Bidentate malondiamidine hydrochloride enables oriented crystallization and strain relaxation in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for 29.0% efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG&#8208;PSCs) are essential for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, their efficiency and stability are limited by inhomogeneous crystallization, which induces disordered crystal orientation and detrimental lattice strain. Herein, malondiamidine hydrochloride (MAMCl) is introduced as a new ligand that simultaneously controls crystal nucleation orientation and passivates grain boundaries in WBG perovskites while relieving lattice strain. MAMCl's unique molecular structure &#8211; featuring amide and amidine terminal groups connected by a short carbon chain, exhibits strong binding affinity with lead ions, promoting preferential (100)&#8208;oriented nucleation. The ligand's compact molecular structure, devoid of sterically hindering groups, facilitates charge extraction and transport at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface. During thermal processing, MAMCl preferentially anchors at grain boundaries through strong coordination bonding, effectively mitigating lattice strain and enhancing thermal stability. As a result, single&#8208;junction 1.77 eV WBG&#8208;PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% with an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.369 V. When incorporated into tandem devices, a high PCE of 29.0% (certified 28.06%) is obtained. Notably, the encapsulated all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices retain 93% of initial efficiency after 700 h and over 80% after 1320 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Multimodal In&#8208;Sensor Computing with Dual&#8208;Phase Organic Synapses for Wearable Fitness Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A dual&#8208;phase organic synaptic sensor detects human respiration and ambient UV light, enabling a wearable neuromorphic system for real&#8208;time exercise monitoring.








Abstract
With the advancement of wearable and mobile devices, demand for the real&#8208;time, low&#8208;power processing of physiological and environmental signals is growing rapidly. To achieve this, neuromorphic systems that employ artificial synapses for analog signal processing and parallel computing represent a promising strategy. In this study, a synaptic sensor is developed that simultaneously responds to human respiration and ambient ultraviolet (UV) light, enabling multimodal analog data processing. The proposed device is fabricated using the organic semiconductor 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Di(4&#8208;biphenylyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene, which has distinct bulk and channel phases. Human respiration&#8208;induced airflow is converted into a synaptic current via charge trapping triggered by the interaction between molecules of water and the bulk phase, leading to real&#8208;time detection of the respiratory rate. The inherent photosensitivity of the device also allows for simultaneous UV detection, thus capturing the environmental exposure conditions. Using these multimodal sensing and processing capabilities, a real&#8208;time feedback system is implemented that supports exercise monitoring by integrating physiological and environmental information. This work demonstrates the potential use of synaptic sensors as front&#8208;end components in wearable neuromorphic platforms, offering a compact, energy&#8208;efficient, and intelligent interface for healthcare and personalized information services.

         <title>Ladder&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Frameworks with Highly Delocalized &#960;&#8208;Electrons and Dense Redox&#8208;Active Sites toward Robust Aqueous Iron Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) ladder&#8208;type covalent organic framework (HAQ&#8208;COF), featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and densely packed carbonyl/imine redox sites, is synthesized, which represents the first application of COFs as cathodes in aqueous iron&#8208;ion batteries (AIIBs). Notably, HAQ&#8208;COF cathodes demonstrate high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, enriching the application of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type COFs in AIIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous iron&#8208;ion batteries (AIIBs) have demonstrated fascinating advantages in large&#8208;scale energy storage, whereas the development of high&#8208;performance Fe2+ hosting cathode materials is still at its infancy. Herein, two hexaazatrinaphthyalene (HATN)&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (namely HAQ&#8208;COF and HAB&#8208;COF) are synthesized and for the first time served them as cathodes for AIIBs. The rigid backbones and delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron networks endow them with stable structure and fast charge transport, while the dense arrangement of redox&#8208;active groups in HAQ&#8208;COF generates more chelating sites, which can facilitate the storage of multivalent metal ions. As a result, HAQ&#8208;COF cathodes for AIIBs delivers a high specific capacity of 226 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A&#160;g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 87% capacity retention over 26&#160;000 cycles at 2 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Combined experimental (in situ/ex situ spectroscopy) analyses and DFT calculations uncover a dual&#8208;site 24&#8208;electron redox mechanism with Fe2+ sequentially coordination by carbonyl and imine moieties. This work not only establishes BBL&#8208;type COFs as high&#8208;performance cathodes for AIIBs but also provides mechanistic insight into Fe2+ storage, thereby informing rational design of sustainable and high&#8208;performance cathode materials for multivalent&#8208;ion energy storage systems.

         <title>A 2D Van Der Waals Molecular Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D van der Waals molecular ferroelectric is reported, in which coordination bonded molecule&#8208;based monolayers are knitted together by weak van der Waals forces. It can be mechanically exfoliated into ultrathin flake with room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity down to 9 nm, which has never been achieved in traditional molecular ferroelectrics.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics have aroused great interest for their novel structures and functionalities in many applications such as in&#8208;memory computing and ferroelectric detectors. However, the documented 2D ferroelectrics remain very rare, mainly limited to inorganic ones represented by transition metal thio/selenophosphates. Constructing new 2D vdW ferroelectric categories may bring interesting phenomena, but it has always been a challenge. Here, a molecular 2D vdW ferroelectric sodium 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropionate (2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS) is successfully designed through H/F substitution, which adopts a unique stable layered structure where each coordination bonded molecule&#8208;based 2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS monolayers knitted together by weak vdW forces between protruding (&#8722;CHF2) cantilevers in the adjacent two monolayers. More strikingly, it can show robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity even in a mechanically exfoliated ultrathin flake as thin as 9&#160;nm, which has never been achieved in traditional molecular ferroelectrics with ferroelectricity mainly in the bulk form and micron&#8208;scale thin film. To the best of the knowledge, 2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS is the first molecular 2D vdWs ferroelectric showing robust ferroelectricity in sub&#8208;10&#160;nm thickness. This work expands the diversity of 2D vdW ferroelectrics and sheds light on the exploration of molecular 2D vdW ferroelectrics with promising low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity for applications in nanoscale devices.

Constructing new 2D vdW ferroelectric categories may bring interesting phenomena, but it has always been a challenge. Here, a molecular 2D vdW ferroelectric sodium 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropionate (2,2,3,3-TFPS) is successfully designed through H/F substitution, which adopts a unique stable layered structure where each coordination bonded molecule-based 2,2,3,3-TFPS monolayers knitted together by weak vdW forces between protruding (&#8722;CHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cantilevers in the adjacent two monolayers. More strikingly, it can show robust room-temperature ferroelectricity even in a mechanically exfoliated ultrathin flake as thin as 9&#160;nm, which has never been achieved in traditional molecular ferroelectrics with ferroelectricity mainly in the bulk form and micron-scale thin film. To the best of the knowledge, 2,2,3,3-TFPS is the first molecular 2D vdWs ferroelectric showing robust ferroelectricity in sub-10&#160;nm thickness. This work expands the diversity of 2D vdW ferroelectrics and sheds light on the exploration of molecular 2D vdW ferroelectrics with promising low-dimensional ferroelectricity for applications in nanoscale devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Synaptic Transistors with Improved Retention for Logic and Biosignal Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing enhances organic electrochemical synaptic transistors by improving molecular order, yielding stable multilevel conductance with long&#8208;term reliability under ambient conditions. The devices unify memory, sensing, and computation, demonstrated in logic gates, biosignal recording, and neuromorphic activity classification, offering a pathway toward robust bio&#8208;inspired electronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OESTs) based on organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) present a promising platform for bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing and bioelectronics. However, achieving long&#8208;term memory retention and precise conductance modulation under ambient conditions remains a key challenge. Here, a solid&#8208;state OEST gated by a semi&#8208;solid ionic liquid gel, in which thermal annealing significantly enhances memory characteristics and operation reliability by tuning the thin film microstructure and ion&#8208;polymer interactions, is reported. The optimized devices exhibit stable multilevel conductance with 82% retention over 1000 s across five distinct states, and negligible drift over 20000 operation cycles under ambient conditions. These devices are integrated into non&#8208;volatile logic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR) and applied in high&#8208;fidelity recording and storage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for up to 1200 s, with reusability over 7 days. They are also used for neuromorphic computing of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for activity classification. This work advances the development of reliable, high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic devices, offering a route toward in&#8208;sensory processing and logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory architectures for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Construction of Diverse Calcium&#8208;Based Nanomaterials through a&#160;Microemulsion Method for Pyroptosis&#8208;Initiated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal microemulsion approach using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as surfactant and calcium source enables the synthesis of diverse calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials. Calcium succinate nanoparticles (PCS NPs) induce pyroptosis via calcium overload, and upregulate MHC&#8208;I expression, enhancing immune response and alleviating immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. This strategy offers a novel platform for tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;regulated immunotherapy with broad applications.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials have gained significant attention in biomedical fields due to their critical roles in biological processes and excellent biocompatibility. In this study, a universal and simple microemulsion approach is presented using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as both surfactant and calcium source, enabling the synthesis of diverse calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials (e.g., calcium succinate, calcium hypophosphite, calcium metatungstate, calcium gluconate, calcium formate, and calcium citrate). To address the challenges of inadequate immune response in tumor immunotherapy, calcium succinate nanoparticle&#160;(PCS NP) is&#160;investigated as an example. The PCS NP exhibit enhanced immunotherapeutic potential by activating the caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway via calcium overload, which in turn enhanced the immune response. Additionally, the anionic succinate component upregulates major histocompatibility complex&#8208;I (MHC&#8208;I) expression, enhancing antigen presentation and alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This microemulsion strategy provides a novel platform for calcium nanomaterial fabrication, opening new avenues for TME&#8208;regulated immunotherapy enhancement, demonstrating a broad application prospect.

         <title>Crystalline Confinement of Dynamic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Hydrogels: A New Paradigm for Synergistic Enhancement between Lifetime and Flexibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating high toughness and persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in crystalline&#8208;induced dynamic RTP materials represents a fundamental challenge. Here, a crystalline confinement strategy is developed using ionic comonomers to precisely modulate crystalline domains. Hydration competition tailors crystalline domains to achieve exceptional toughness (12 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) while electrostatic anchoring stabilizes triplet excitons to extend phosphorescence lifetime to 598.79 ms, overcoming the intrinsic materials limitation. 








Abstract
Dynamic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials present promising applications in optoelectronic fields.&#160; However, conventional dynamic RTP hydrogels typically suffer from an inherent performance trade&#8208;off, where enhancement of flexibility comes at the expense of phosphorescence lifetime and vice versa. Herein, a universal crystalline confinement strategy is reported to overcome this fundamental limitation by employing ionic comonomers to regulate crystalline domains. By incorporating ionic comonomers such as 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPM), the hydration competition and disruption of crystalline packing enable precise control over crystal dimensions, yielding hydrogels with exceptional stretchability (634%) and toughness (12 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, 107&#8208;fold improvement). The ionic comonomers also serve as electrostatic anchoring sites for chromophores, stabilizing triplet excitons and significantly prolonging the phosphorescence lifetime to 598.79 ms. This approach overcomes traditional trade&#8208;offs between flexibility and phosphorescence lifetime, demonstrating broad applicability across various ionic comonomers with &#8776;100&#8208;fold toughness enhancements and prolonged phosphorescence lifetime. These results establish a generalizable framework linking crystalline domain dynamics with photophysical properties in dynamic hydrogels. The design opens avenues for advanced dynamic RTP materials in stretchable optoelectronics, dynamic encryption, smart sensors, and reagent thermal history monitoring.

         <title>Flexible Graphene@Silica Fabric Metasurface for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption on High&#8208;Speed Aircraft</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, ultrathin (0.1 mm), and thermally robust graphene@silica fabric metasurface with tunable impedance for aerospace EMW absorption via chemical vapor deposition and laser &#8220;erasing&#8221; technique. This metasurface is directly integrated onto the aircraft thermal&#8208;insulation layer and ensures excellent durability under high temperatures, high&#8208;speed airflow scouring, and mechanical stress, making it ideal for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Modern high&#8208;speed aircraft require materials that can absorb electromagnetic waves (EMWs) while remaining lightweight, flexible, and resistant to extreme heat flux. Although graphene@silica fabric (G@SF) is a promising metasurface in this regard, its EMW dissipation capacity is limited by its uniform sheet resistance distribution, which leads to mismatched interfacial wave impedance. In this study, a subtractive laser &#8220;erasing&#8221; technique is applied to G@SF grown via chemical vapor deposition to develop a scalable, flexible, ultrathin (0.1&#160;mm), and thermally robust (up to 1000 &#176;C) metasurface with tunable impedance for aerospace EMW absorption. This metasurface is directly integrated onto the aircraft thermal&#8208;insulation layer to obtain an integrated absorber that minimizes radar reflection (down to &#8722;42&#160;dB) without adding significant weight or altering aircraft structure. The all&#8208;inorganic design ensures excellent durability under high temperatures, high&#8208;speed airflow scouring, and mechanical stress, making it ideal for aerospace applications. The proposed method is a promising approach for fabricating next&#8208;generation EMW&#8208;absorbing materials that combine performance, resilience, and manufacturability.

         <title>Mirror Life: Bridging Chirality, Ethics, and the Foundations of Life Creation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging chirality and materials science, this review charts how mirror&#8208;image building blocks enable stable biomaterials and therapeutics and propel efforts toward mirror cells. Applications in chiral biomaterials and therapeutics are surveyed, alongside engineering strategies toward mirror cells and protocells, and a pragmatic biosafety/ethics and containment roadmap for orthogonal, materials&#8208;based life systems.








Abstract
Biological homochirality, defined by the exclusive use of L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;sugars in terrestrial life, is essential for molecular recognition, enzymatic specificity, and cellular function. Recent advances in synthetic chemistry and molecular engineering have enabled the creation of mirror&#8208;image biomolecules such as D&#8208;peptides, L&#8208;DNA, and L&#8208;RNA, laying the foundation for orthogonal biological systems. These systems encompass engineered bacteria, viruses, and protocells composed entirely of D&#8208;amino acids and L&#8208;nucleotides. Mirror organisms represent a novel class of synthetic life with transformative potential in biomedicine. They may be used to develop protease&#8208;resistant drugs, nuclease&#8208;stable genetic elements, biosensors, and tissue engineering scaffolds, applications where biological durability and immune invisibility are advantageous. However, their unnatural chirality raises significant biosafety concerns. These organisms may escape immune detection, resist host antimicrobial defenses, and evade ecological regulators such as predation and microbial competition. This introduces the risk of uncontrolled proliferation in clinical or environmental settings. This review examines stereoselective synthesis of mirror biomolecules, construction of functional mirror subsystems, and engineering of mirror&#8208;life architectures.

     alt="Mirror Life: Bridging Chirality, Ethics, and the Foundations of Life Creation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging chirality and materials science, this review charts how mirror-image building blocks enable stable biomaterials and therapeutics and propel efforts toward mirror cells. Applications in chiral biomaterials and therapeutics are surveyed, alongside engineering strategies toward mirror cells and protocells, and a pragmatic biosafety/ethics and containment roadmap for orthogonal, materials-based life systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological homochirality, defined by the exclusive use of L-amino acids and D-sugars in terrestrial life, is essential for molecular recognition, enzymatic specificity, and cellular function. Recent advances in synthetic chemistry and molecular engineering have enabled the creation of mirror-image biomolecules such as D-peptides, L-DNA, and L-RNA, laying the foundation for orthogonal biological systems. These systems encompass engineered bacteria, viruses, and protocells composed entirely of D-amino acids and L-nucleotides. Mirror organisms represent a novel class of synthetic life with transformative potential in biomedicine. They may be used to develop protease-resistant drugs, nuclease-stable genetic elements, biosensors, and tissue engineering scaffolds, applications where biological durability and immune invisibility are advantageous. However, their unnatural chirality raises significant biosafety concerns. These organisms may escape immune detection, resist host antimicrobial defenses, and evade ecological regulators such as predation and microbial competition. This introduces the risk of uncontrolled proliferation in clinical or environmental settings. This review examines stereoselective synthesis of mirror biomolecules, construction of functional mirror subsystems, and engineering of mirror-life architectures. It also discusses recent progress in chiral biomaterials, including L-DNA hydrogels, nanostructures, and metamaterials, with potential applications in drug delivery, sensing, and regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Green Hydrogen Production via Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC graphic highlights the newly fabricated PAA37 membrane, which exhibits exceptional ion selectivity. This membrane enables, for the first time, the practical application of using osmotic energy to directly power water electrolysis for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the PAA37 membrane can be mass&#8208;produced via a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process, demonstrating its significant potential for large&#8208;scale applications in osmotic power generation and hydrogen production.








Abstract
Harnessing renewable energy for green hydrogen production is critical for decarbonization. An ideal, sustainable route involves self&#8208;powered hydrogen production without additional energy input. Here, the osmotic energy between seawater and river water is used to continuously generate electricity to directly produce hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production is successfully achieved by connecting the osmotic energy device composed of the polyamide acid PAA37 ion selective membrane and the water electrolysis device in series. The PAA37 membrane, featuring engineered sub&#8208;nanometer channels, exhibits an ultra&#8208;high cation transference number (t+ = 0.96). Targeting the critical challenge of scaling up osmotic power generation, the HLZ equation is introduced. It theoretically establishes that the decline in power density under large&#8208;area conditions is primarily attributed to the electrode impedance within the low&#8208;concentration zone. This finding offers a theoretical foundation for guiding the optimization of large&#8208;scale device designs. Consequently, the PAA37 membrane achieves a power density of 6.0 W m&#8722;2 over a macroscopic area of 3.14 mm2 under a 50&#8208;fold KCl. Furthermore, by stacking 110 RED units in series, a remarkable output voltage of 24.3 V is generated. By arranging this stack in series and parallel, the system successfully powers an electrolyzer for direct hydrogen production.

         <title>Spatially Programmable Electroadhesive Enables In Situ Site&#8208;Selective Functional Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, in situ spatially programmable bioadhesive (STICH) enables microscale, site&#8208;selective integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue. It achieves robust mechanical bonding and low&#8208;impedance electrical coupling, enabling reconfigurable neuromodulation and directional electromechanical sensing in vivo and ex vivo.








Abstract
Precise intraoperative integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue surfaces remains a challenge due to the limited spatial control of adhesion sites. Here, an in situ spatially programmable electrical bioadhesive (termed &#8220;STICH&#8221;)&#160;is reported that enables site&#8208;selective adhesion and functional coupling via light&#8208;activated bonding with wet biological tissue. Upon irradiation with patterned green light, Rose Bengal in a chitosan/silver nanowire hydrogel matrix generates singlet oxygen, which oxidizes amino acid residues into carbonyl groups on the tissue surface. The covalent bonding is then formed between the newly formed reactive carbonyl group and amine groups on chitosan. The spatially programmable adhesive allows robust tissue bonding with a lap&#8208;shear strength of 160&#160;kPa and precise adhesion regions at &#8776;2 &#181;m resolution. The light&#8208;patternable adhesive enables spatially resolved mechanical coupling for directional electromechanical sensing on ex vivo cardiac tissue. The low impedance adhesive interface also provides spatially programmed electrical coupling for in vivo neuromuscular stimulation on intraoperatively selected muscle groups. This platform advances microscale device&#8208;tissue integration and paves the way for reconfigurable bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>AC Current&#8208;Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports alternating&#8208;current (AC) driven magnetization reversal in a semi&#8208;magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, with low current density. Time&#8208;domain Hall voltage measurements reveal a nonlinear and rectified Hall effect, along with higher&#8208;harmonic responses and hysteresis. These findings, including asymmetric frequency mixing, offer potential for spintronic applications like signal processing and frequency conversion.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque arising from the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current&#8208;induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating&#8208;current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi&#8208;magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5 &#215; 109&#8197;A&#8197;m&#8722;2. Time&#8208;domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and rectified Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time&#8208;varying Hall voltage identifies higher&#8208;harmonic signals and a rectified direct&#8208;current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current&#8208;voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual&#8208;frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial&#8208;based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy&#8208;efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Phosphates Conformal Coating Enabling 5.0 V Graphite Cathodes Over 10,000 Cycles via Reinforced Mechanical Strength and Optimized Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;dependent phosphate conformal coating capable of effectively suppressing the electrolyte decomposition and considerably enhancing the mechanical stability of graphite cathode via a bonding interaction with binder enables 5.0 V graphite cathodes over 10,000 cycles with an exceptional capacity retention of 80.7% in dual&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) composed of a graphite cathode and a lithium anode are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy storage systems. However, graphite cathode undergoes rapid failure during the extended cycling and rapid charge/discharge mainly because of its structural breakdown and drastic resistance rise of cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) arising from the violent electrolyte decomposition at high voltage (4.5&#8211;5.0 V). Unlike the mainstream CEI modification strategy solely solving the problem of electrolyte decomposition, this work proposes a bifunctional CEI construction strategy that not only inhibits the electrolyte decomposition but also enhances the mechanical stability of graphite cathodes. Three pH&#8208;variable phosphates (LiH2PO4, Li2HPO4 and Li3PO4) are artificially coated on the surface of natural graphite (NG) particles through a green and low&#8208;cost wet coating route. The acidic LiH2PO4 coating not only effectively suppresses the electrolyte decomposition through the formation of a conformal coating layer, but also considerably enhances the mechanical strength of NG cathode via a strong bonding between LiH2PO4 and binder. The underlying mechanisms are elucidated through both theoretical calculations and empirical experiments. The optimized NG cathode is able to withstand fast charge/discharge at 60 C and exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 80.7% after 10,000 cycles 2 C.

         <title>All Solid State Battery with Soft Carbon&#8211;TiSi2 Multilayer Structure for Optimized LiSi Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries require high&#8208;capacity yet stable Si anodes, which still suffer from severe volume expansion and lithium dendrite growth. This article presents a soft carbon&#8208;TiSi2 multilayer anode that overcomes these challenges. The designed ST5/SC/Li structure enables ultra&#8208;long cycling over 64&#160;000 cycles at 10C with zero capacity decay and charge&#8211;discharge cycling time exceeding 10&#160;000 h. The multilayer architecture offers synergistic effects of stress buffering, dynamic lithium replenishment, and stable ion&#8208;electron dual conduction.








Abstract
Li metal and Si anodes are in urgent need for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) due to their high energy density. However, short&#8208;circuit caused by Li dendrite growth and rapid capacity fading due to severe volume expansion of Si still seriously limit their application. Herein, a Si&#8208;TiSi2&#8208;LPSCl/soft carbon/Li (ST5&#8208;SC&#8208;Li) three&#8208;layer structured anode is designed to overcome these challenges. Multi&#8208;layer structure restricts the anisotropic expansion of Si by using the rigid support of TiSi2 and the plastic deformation capability of LPSCl. The composite layer forms a continuous ionic channel through close contact between Si and sulfide electrolyte, and constructs an &#8220;ion&#8208;electron dual network&#8221; in addition to the high electronic conductivity of the Si&#8208;Ti alloy. The SC layer forms ion&#8208;conductive LiC6, further absorbing expansion stress and inhibiting dendrite penetration. The Li metal layer dynamically compensates for the irreversible capacity loss of Si. The LCO/LPSCl/ST5&#8208;SC&#8208;Li SASSBs achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 64&#160;000 cycles at a high rate of 10C (6.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) with a capacity retention rate &gt;100%. Separately, a high reversible areal capacity of 19.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 0.1C under high loading.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Polymer Materials for QD&#8208;Sensitized NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Upconversion Beyond the Silicon Bandgap</title>

Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;sensitized upconversion mixtures are encapsulated in droplets within a rigid polymer matrix, enabling liquid&#8208;like NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) in a pseudo&#8208;solid format. The system achieves record&#8208;high &#951;UCs${\eta _{U{C_s}}}$ for QD&#8208;sensitized solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC in the NIR&#8208;I regime and the first measurement of NIR&#8208;II UC emission efficiency at 1064&#160;nm, offering a viable pathway toward silicon&#8208;compatible infrared photovoltaics and photodetectors.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot (QD) sensitized triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) offers a promising strategy for harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons in silicon photovoltaics and infrared photodetectors. However, translating solution&#8208;based upconversion to the solid state remains a major challenge due to severe efficiency losses. Here, a hybrid approach is reported that encapsulates QD&#8208;sensitized upconversion mixtures into mesoscale droplets within a rigid acrylate matrix, preserving liquid&#8208;like dynamics in a pseudo&#8208;solid form. Using a system of PbS sensitizer, carboxytetracene mediator, and TES&#8208;ADT annihilator, a normalized UC emission efficiency (&#951;UC) of 0.72% and upconverted singlet state generation efficiency (&#951;UCs${\eta _{U{C_s}}}$) of 18% in the NIR&#8208;I regime (785&#160;nm excitation) is achieved, record&#8208;high for solid&#8208;state QD&#8208;sensitized systems. A key advance lies in the rational design of a chemically compatible polymer system that enables spontaneous phase separation of QDs into nanodroplets while preserving QD surface chemistry, preventing an over 1000&#8208;fold drop in upconversion efficiency observed in chemically incompatible control systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that PbS surface chemistry and dynamics are maintained within nanodroplets. Extending this approach to the NIR&#8208;II regime, the first quantifiable solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC under 1064&#160;nm excitation is demonstrated, achieving &#951;UC of 0.022% (&#951;UCs${\eta _{U{C_s}}}$ of 0.55%). These findings represent a substantial step toward integrating QD&#8208;sensitized TTA&#8208;UC into Si&#8208;based optoelectronics.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Scaffolded Bispecific Antibodies Enhance Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Y&#8208;shaped bispecific antibody enhances the homing efficiency of mesenchymal stromal cells and enables competitive binding to leukocyte receptors. Engineered cells preferentially accumulate in inflamed colonic tissue, suppress immune cell infiltration, and promote colonic tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered a promising cell&#8208;based therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), due to their potent immunomodulatory properties and robust regenerative potential. However, their therapeutic efficacy against IBD is hindered by poor homing capacity and excessive leukocyte infiltration at inflamed colonic sites. In this study, MSCs with a Y&#8208;shaped bispecific antibody (YMV) assembled via DNA nanotechnology, which integrates anti&#8208;vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;VCAM&#8208;1) and anti&#8208;mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecules&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;MAdCAM&#8208;1) antibodies are engineered, to enhance targeted delivery and inhibit leukocyte recruitment. YMV&#8208;modified MSCs show an approximately threefold enhancement in adhesion efficiency compared with native MSCs. Notably, they effectively compete for MAdCAM&#8208;1 binding sites and significantly suppress leukocyte adhesion. In a mouse model of IBD, YMV&#8208;MSCs demonstrate enhanced homing to the colon, promote mucosal repair, reduce leukocyte infiltration, and attenuate local inflammation. This DNA&#8208;mediated bispecific antibody modification strategy improves MSCs targeting and exerts anti&#8208;inflammatory effects by blocking leukocyte recruitment, offering a promising platform for MSC&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Elevated 3D Helical Oscillator with Addressable Eigenfrequency for Wearable Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on frequency division multiplexing and electromagnetic induction, a 3D self&#8208;elevated helical oscillating unit (SEHOU) for wearable high&#8208;capacity human&#8208;machine interactions is developed. Eigenfrequencies of multiple SEHOUs can be collected by one flexible coil upon triggering of oscillations. Crosstalk&#8208;free communications are achieved on a single piece of SEHOU&#8208;based interface without compromising the overall wearability.








Abstract
Equipped with 3D architecture, flexible electronic devices enable intuitive tactile sensing with enhanced spatial efficiency and skin conformity. However, realizing 3D metasurfaces on a flexible substrate remains laborious. Furthermore, conventional methodology often requires complex electrical connections and communication channels to realize tactile addressing. Leveraging magnetic repulsion among ferromagnetic microstructures, here, the spontaneous formation of a 3D self&#8208;elevated helical oscillating unit (SEHOU) on flexible films is presented. Through specific pattern design, the 3D morphology can be precisely tuned upon built&#8208;in magnetic moments that balance with the inherent elastic strength. Based on electromagnetic induction, axial vibrations of SEHOU generate sinusoidal electric signals with an intrinsic oscillating frequency. Along with the theoretical model, non&#8208;overlapping eigenfrequencies are customized, allowing convenient mapping of mechanical inputs from the received electrical signals. It is shown that crosstalk&#8208;free interactions can be achieved on a single piece of SEHOU&#8208;based interface, e.g., multi&#8208;touch recognition, without compromising the overall wearability. Further, the developed fabric coils and signal analysis modules showcase the potential for wireless Internet of Things. This methodology provides a valuable reference to establish reliable, scalable, and distributed tactile addressing for high&#8208;capacity human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Synergistic Engineering of Nonmagnetic Ions Enables Decoupling of Magnetic Frustration and Structural Dynamics in Cobalt&#8208;Free High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a promising strategy to design high&#8208;performance cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;nickel cathodes by introducing non&#8208;magnetic ions to suppress magnetic interactions and significantly strengthen metal&#8211;oxygen bonds. Multi&#8208;ion cooperative doping (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) enables the formation of a fast&#8208;transport layered&#8208;spinel nano&#8208;heterostructure. Additionally, the B&#8208;enriched near&#8208;surface layer effectively stabilizes the interface and inhibits HF erosion.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;nickel layered oxides have emerged as promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their exceptional capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their large&#8209;scale application remains constrained by intrinsic deficiencies stemming from cobalt absence&#8212;namely, magnetic&#8209;ordering imbalance and sluggish structural dynamics. Here, a synergistic doping strategy involving nonmagnetic ions (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) is presented to achieve atomic&#8208;scale coordination between bulk lattice stabilization (via Al/W doping) and near&#8208;surface interface passivation (through B enrichment). Precise substitution of non&#8209;magnetic cations effectively mitigates magnetic frustration and superexchange interactions, while strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen bonding alleviates anisotropic lattice strain.

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a promising strategy to design high-performance cobalt-free high-nickel cathodes by introducing non-magnetic ions to suppress magnetic interactions and significantly strengthen metal&#8211;oxygen bonds. Multi-ion cooperative doping (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) enables the formation of a fast-transport layered-spinel nano-heterostructure. Additionally, the B-enriched near-surface layer effectively stabilizes the interface and inhibits HF erosion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt-free high-nickel layered oxides have emerged as promising cathode candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, owing to their exceptional capacity and cost-effectiveness. However, their large&#8209;scale application remains constrained by intrinsic deficiencies stemming from cobalt absence&#8212;namely, magnetic&#8209;ordering imbalance and sluggish structural dynamics. Here, a synergistic doping strategy involving nonmagnetic ions (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) is presented to achieve atomic-scale coordination between bulk lattice stabilization (via Al/W doping) and near-surface interface passivation (through B enrichment). Precise substitution of non&#8209;magnetic cations effectively mitigates magnetic frustration and superexchange interactions, while strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen bonding alleviates anisotropic lattice strain. Simultaneously, the constructed layered&#8211;spinel mortise and tenon structure significantly enhances Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. The optimized cathode material delivers a reversible capacity of 162.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 C, retains 88.6% capacity after 100 cycles at 5 C, and markedly suppresses voltage fade. This work provides a novel design paradigm for the synergistic magnetic&#8211;electrochemical regulation of Co&#8209;free, high-Ni cathodes in next&#8209;generation, high&#8209;performance LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;Buffering Interphase Enabled by Hierarchical Nanostructure Engineering of Gel Polymers for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering gel layer is fabricated through a facile and precisely controlled copolymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation strategy. The gel layer exhibits a mult&#8208;ilevel Zn2+&#8208;buffering capability that synergistically integrates hydrophobicity, nanoconfined ion transport, and highly efficient desolvation, achieving an ultra&#8208;stable electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by the unstable Zn anode interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, for the first time, a hierarchical nanostructure&#8208;engineered hydrogel interphase layer is developed via a facile and precisely controlled copolymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (CIMS) strategy, which enables multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering to stabilize the Zn anode interface: 1) The nanoconfinement effect, combined with the hydrophobicity ofmethylacryloyloxypropyl cage&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MP&#8208;POSS), facilitates [Zn(H2O)6]2+ desolvation while blocking water and SO42&#8722; penetration, achieving an optimal balance between enhanced Zn2+ transport and minimized side reactions; 2) CIMS between polar comonomers and MP&#8208;POSS creates hierarchical molecular clusters within the hydrogel. These self&#8208;assembled domains homogenize Zn2+ flux and reduce interfacial concentration polarization, realizing dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. After modification, symmetric cells achieve exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 5500&#160;h (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and 1500&#160;h (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Asymmetric cell demonstrates an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% after 3600 cycles. MnO2 and V2O5 full cells retain 85.4% and 84.7% capacity retention after 1000 (1 A g&#8722;1) and 2000 (5 A g&#8722;1) cycles, respectively. This research unveils a novel multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering mechanism based on gel polymer hierarchical nanostructure engineering and provides a feasible strategy for advancing grid&#8208;scale AZIBs.

Smart Glass
In article number 2503367, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers developed electrochromic smart glasses with controllable color and polarization by employing &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (&#960;V&#8208;LCLCs). Through simple self&#8208;assembly and polymerization processes, they constructed uniaxially oriented hierarchical nanostructures exhibiting three stable redox states and polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance, demonstrating potential applications in privacy protection and information security technologies.

Aerodynamic Surface Dimpling
Static aerodynamic surfaces cannot adapt to dynamic wind profiles, limiting performance under variable operating conditions. In article number 2505817, Katia Bertoldi and co&#8208;workers introduce a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling textile metamaterial that tunes aerodynamic properties even when body&#8208;conformed. Wind&#8208;tunnel tests and simulations show drag modulation up to 20%. Active stretching enables optimal performance across variable speeds, opening transformative applications in wearables, aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering.

Long&#8208;Term Pain Management
In the Research Article DOI: (10.1002/adma.202503872), Daniel S. Kohane, Christopher B. Weldon, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the development (in vitro and in vivo) of an aptamer/liposome (Lipo&#8208;Apt) drug delivery system that incorporates both affinity&#8208;controlled and diffusion&#8208;controlled drug release mechanisms into a single vehicle, thus prolonging the duration of effect without resultant toxicity. In vivo, a single injection of tetrodotoxin at the sciatic nerve in rats provided prolonged local anesthesia lasting for about one week.

Halogen Ion&#8208;Mediated Strategy for Producing MXenes
In article number 2504586, Li Song and co&#8208;workers reveal the mechanism of halogen ion etching of MAX phases. Subsequently, NH4F rapid etching strategy and organic intercalant&#8208;assisted NH4X heterostructure construction strategy are discovered. These approaches are successfully extended to various MAX phases and heterostructure synthesis, producing Mo2CTx@MoS2 composites with amorphous MoS2 surface layers. The heterostructured MXenes exhibit modulated energy storage mechanisms.

Enzymatic Metabolism Driven by Photonastic Movement in a Bioinspired Starfish Prototissue
In the article number 2502830, Pierangelo Gobbo and co&#8208;workers report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of the first starfish&#8208;like prototissue capable of photonastic movement and photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction. Such higher&#8208;order behaviors emerged from the interaction and collective coordinated responses that were enabled by the spatial integration of specialised protocell units within the prototissue. Applications include modular micro&#8208;bioreactors and soft actuators for biohybrid robotics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article provides a comprehensive review of Si&#8208;based tandem solar cells, highlighting the advantages of silicon as a bottom cell and exploring top cell technologies including III&#8211;V compounds, perovskites, and emerging chalcogenide materials. It summarizes current challenges of these top cell materials and offers insights into future research directions to develop highly efficient Si&#8208;based tandem PV systems.








Abstract
Tandem solar cells, which integrate multiple junctions, present a promising pathway to surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction silicon (Si) solar cells. This article explores why Si is the optimal choice for the bottom cell in tandem configurations and examines various configurations and interconnection techniques that have been reported. It then reviews a range of photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the top cell, including well&#8208;established III&#8211;V compounds and emerging materials like perovskites and chalcogenides PV materials, which are currently used or have potential for use in constructing Si&#8208;based tandem cells. Additionally, the paper highlights the ongoing challenges faced by these top cells in Si&#8208;based tandem technology. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of different PV technological advancements and to identify strategic directions for future research that could lead to the development of highly efficient Si&#8208;based tandem PV systems.

         <title>Ionic Gels for Low&#8208;Grade Heat Energy Harvesting and Thermal Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels are increasingly recognized in energy harvesting and sensing for their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and outstanding thermoelectric performance. This review summarizes recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels for applications in low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting, thermal sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications, while highlighting current challenges and future optimization directions.








Abstract
Harvesting the low&#8208;grade heat energy from the environment and the human body remains an underutilized energy. Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels have garnered significant attention in the fields of energy harvesting and sensing due to their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and excellent thermoelectric performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels in application of temperature sensing and low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting. The narration begins with the introduction of the synthetic and natural polymer for i&#8208;TE gels. Then, various methods are discussed to enhance the mechanical performance (stretchability, self&#8208;healing, and mechanical durability) to satisfy the flexible device based on i&#8208;TE gels. Noticeably, this work emphatically summarizes the improvement methods of thermopower for i&#8208;TE gels, including the preparation of n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE gels and the bidirectional modulation of their thermopower. Finally, this work explores the diverse applications of i&#8208;TE gels, including low&#8208;grade heat harvesting, sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Causal Relationships for the Electrolyte and Interphase Designs During Lithium Metal Plating/Stripping Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main barriers to the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) should originate from the imperfect solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anode (LMA). This review comprehensively analyses and focuses on the causal relationship between the electrolyte and SEI design during the lithium plating/stripping process, and its content will provide inspiration for its practical application of high&#8208;energy LMBs and boost the enduring enthusiasm in this field.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal battery (LMB) is widely recognized as the game&#8208;changer for the currently commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, because of their high energy density when paired with many cathodes such as layered oxide cathode (500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), sulfur cathode (600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), and oxygen cathode (700&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). In addition to the energy&#8208;related application, the electrochemical Li metal plating/stripping process is also the core for Li&#8208;mediated ammonia synthesis, Li plasmon&#8208;based low&#8208;powered dynamic color display, and so on. However, the insufficient understanding of the electrochemical process of the Li metal plating/stripping process is still restraining the development of these research directions. Herein, key advances for the key properties of solid electrolyte interphase, electrolyte engineering, and the artificial solid electrode interphase of lithium metal anode are reviewed. Based on these contents, several key points for the practical application of LMBs, including electrolyte design, energy density, and safety, are outlooked.

         <title>Crystal Orientation Engineering for Energy Storage and Conversion Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in crystal orientation engineering for energy materials. It discusses orientation&#8208;dependent properties, characterization methods, preparation strategies, and their applications in energy conversion and storage systems. It provides insights into how orientation control enables performance breakthroughs in energy&#8208;related applications and may guide future developments in this emerging field.








Abstract
Nanoscale material design&#160;is crucial to the development of efficient renewable energy and storage technologies. While conventional research paradigms have emphasized material morphology, crystal polymorphs, and defect engineering, recent years have witnessed an emerging research interest in crystal orientation engineering since it can exploit anisotropic material properties to significantly enhance&#160; emerging energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of engineering the crystal orientation of materials to improve various energy conversion and storage technologies is provided. First, we discuss the effect of crystal orientation on material properties, including electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, surface energy, surface electronic structure, atom/molecule adsorption ability, and ionic conductivity. Then, the techniques to characterize the crystal orientation, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy, are reviewed. After that, effective&#160;strategies to engineer crystal orientation using both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches are summarized. The advances in crystal orientation engineering in energy conversion (electrocatalysis, solar cells, and nanogenerators) and storage (metal anodes, non&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrode materials, and solid electrolytes) applications are subsequently discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the potential of crystal orientation engineering and its impact on emerging energy transition technologies are summarized.

         <title>Solvation Chemistry of Nonaqueous Electrolytes for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of solvation chemistry in Mg electrolytes. The established connection provides valuable guidance for designing next&#8208;generation Mg electrolytes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and abundant resource availability. However, the development of ideal electrolytes that enable reversible Mg plating/stripping and ensure electrode compatibility remains a significant bottleneck. Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing this challenge, highlighting the need for a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the complex nature of Mg electrolytes. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the advances in nonaqueous Mg electrolytes, with an emphasis on solvation chemistry that governs ion transport, redox kinetics, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. A systematic analysis of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships in Mg electrolytes. Furthermore, the key challenges and emerging research trends in Mg electrolytes are summarized. This work underscores the critical role of mastering solvation chemistry in optimizing RMB performance and provides principled guidance for rational, bottom&#8208;up Mg electrolyte design.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication Methods of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods of metal halide perovskites, such as thermal evaporation, magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e&#8208;beam and atomic layer deposition, solid phase growth, and laser printing. It outlines the current state of knowledge and discusses key challenges and future research directions.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have ascended as a remarkable class of materials in recent years, demonstrating exceptional promise for application in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. The vast majority of research on these materials focuses on their processing from solution, which is relatively easily executed in laboratory settings, but its scalability for industrial mass production remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, its reliance on highly toxic solvents imposes limitations with respect to large&#8208;area fabrication and have a negative environmental impact. This review comprehensively explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods for metal halide perovskites, outlines the current challenges and opportunities, and provides a critical assessment of the technological readiness and future research directions. The development of robust and scalable solvent&#8208;free fabrication methodologies is essential to realizing the full potential of metal halide perovskites. We hope that this review will serve as a catalyst, inspiring and guiding researchers to explore new strategies for the solvent&#8208;free deposition of these remarkable materials, thereby expediting their integration into technological applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Scaffolds for Enhanced Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the development and use of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds in tissue engineering. Bioinspired phospholipid and glycocalyx coatings enhance anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;thrombogenic, and selective molecular recognition properties. Native cell membrane coatings further support cell&#8208;specific interactions, immune modulation, and reduced bacterial adhesion. Recent advances in skin, bone, neural, and vascular regeneration highlight their broad therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Cell membranes are emerging as valuable models for regulating scaffold&#8208;cell interactions in tissue engineering. Their unique structure and function provide an ideal template for creating biomimetic surfaces that support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This has led to the development of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds (CMCSs), a new class of biomaterials designed to mimic native cellular interfaces and improve therapeutic outcomes. This review begins with an overview of cell&#8211;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, highlighting their key roles in tissue remodeling and healing. It then introduces ECM&#8208;inspired coatings before focusing on CMCSs. A detailed analysis of scaffolds coated with specific membrane components or entire cell membranes is presented, with applications in skin and wound healing, bone regeneration, neural repair, and vascular grafts. Techniques for membrane extraction, surface functionalization, and preservation of membrane integrity and orientation are analyzed. CMCSs demonstrate advantages over traditional scaffolds, including improved homotypic cell attraction, immune modulation, and resistance to non&#8208;specific protein and bacterial adhesion. However, several challenges persist, such as standardizing membrane isolation methods, optimizing coating density, and evaluating the stability and reproducibility of coatings, especially when using hybrid membranes from multiple cell types. Overcoming these barriers could significantly advance scaffold technologies for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Hydrogels Emerging from Dynamic and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive behaviors in hydrogels often arise from dynamic or non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains. This review highlights self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogels formed through dynamic crosslinking motifs, discussing their underlying mechanisms and emergent applications across biomedical and engineering contexts.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive hydrogels undergo changes in their physical and chemical properties in response to mechanical stimuli such as strain, force, or shear stress. These responses are often mediated by dynamic or non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. Unlike covalent bonds, which confer desirable mechanical strength but result in static networks, dynamic crosslinking motifs introduce reversibility that enables mechanically actuatable behaviors such as self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning or &#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening. This review highlights these four distinct mechanoresponsive behaviors in dynamic hydrogels, examining their underlying mechanisms, characterization methods, and emerging applications, with a focus on the critical role of dynamic interactions in enabling their mechanoresponsive properties.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production via Small Molecules Electrooxidation&#8208;Assisted Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation&#8208;assisted hybrid electrochemical systems provide an appealing solution for achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. This review summarizes recent advances in such hybrid systems, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, bipolar hydrogen production, and electricity output. In addition, the remaining challenges and future prospects for hybrid energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production systems are discussed.








Abstract
To alleviate overdependence on traditional fossil resources, green hydrogen (H2) production from an electrochemical water splitting (EWS) system powered by renewable energy resources (i.e., tidal, wind, and solar energy) has garnered considerable attention for its environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the H2 production efficiency of the EWS system is restricted by the sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which inhibits its further large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, recent advances in the hybrid EWS systems that substitutes OER with the thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation reaction (SMEOR) to integrate with the hydrogen evolution reaction are reviewed. First, the catalytic mechanisms of electrocatalysts toward SMEOR, reactor configurations, and evaluation parameters are briefly summarized. Next, the advantages and characteristics of the hybrid systems of SMEOR integrated with hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction are highlighted and discussed in detail, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, production of value&#8208;added chemicals, bipolar H2 production, and electricity output. Subsequently, the optimization strategies for rationally engineering the catalysts of SMEOR are proposed. Last, the current obstacles and future expectations of the hybrid EWS systems are outlined. This review aims to stimulate the further evolution of green H2 production.

Light activation of gas sensors is a promising strategy for enabling power&#8208;efficient operation in next&#8208;generation smart devices, where a rational design of sensing layers can enhance light energy utilization. This review discusses design strategies for light&#8208;activated gas sensors, including doping&#8208;induced band structure tuning, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering, along with key factors in light&#8208;activated gas sensing.








Abstract
Light activation stands out as one of the most&#160;promising&#160;strategies for improving the energy efficiency of chemiresistive gas sensors, a crucial step toward their commercialization and integration with smart devices. Current designs of light&#8208;activated gas sensors have primarily focused on catalyst decoration and doping in various photoreactive substrates (e.g., semiconducting metal oxides, conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks, or transition metal dichalcogenides). These approaches aim to induce surface activation to varying extents rather than optimizing the material itself for efficient light&#8208;energy utilization. Consequently, advancing light&#8208;activated gas sensor technology requires a dual focus on enhancing gas response characteristics and maximizing the utilization of incident light energy. To this end, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photochemical mechanisms governing light&#8208;activated gas sensing, highlights key factors for performance optimization, and discusses the recent advancement in design strategies such as band structure tuning through doping, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering. This review concludes with insights on future research directions in material development, signal processing, and device integration, offering a comprehensive perspective on the practical advancements of light&#8208;activated gas sensing technology.

         <title>Biohybrid Microrobot Enteric&#8208;Coated Microcapsule for Oral Treatment of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative oral drug delivery system using piezoelectric BaTiO&#8323; nanoparticles on Enterobacter aerogenes microrobots encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microrobots can penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and target the colorectal tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor cell death through ultrasound&#8208;activated reactions while simultaneously promoting an immune response against tumors.








Abstract
The oral treatment of colorectal cancer is highly desirable due to its noninvasiveness and potential for localized drug action, yet it remains challenged by gastrointestinal barriers and limited intratumoral penetration. This study presents the first oral biohybrid microrobot system that integrates ultrasound&#8208;activated piezoelectric catalysis with bacterial therapy, achieving synergistic tumor targeting, reactive oxygen species generation, and immune activation. By leveraging Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) and BaTiO3 nanoparticles, this strategy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and metabolic remodeling. It utilizes BaTiO3 incorporated into EA (EA@BTO) microrobots, which are encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microcapsules, encapsulated in enteric microcapsules via photocurable 3D printing, protect during digestion, target tumors, penetrate mucus, and release gases. They thrive in anaerobic, acidic environments, enabling precise, responsive delivery within the intestinal tract. Once the microrobots reach the tumor, the BaTiO3 nanoparticles catalyze reduction and oxidation reactions upon ultrasound irradiation, leading to the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Notably, the consumption of lactic acid by BaTiO3 and EA alleviates the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the tumor. This promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby reducing the proportion of regulatory T cells and enhancing the population of effector T cells.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Bioprinting of Mini&#8208;Muscles with Self&#8208;Renewal Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the FLight biofabrication for engineering in vitro muscle constructs by photocrosslinking pristine collagen and fibrinogen using ruthenium. The resulting mini&#8208;muscles retain in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization and a Pax7&#8314; cell pool. Notably, these mini&#8208;muscles are self&#8208;renewable upon injury, and their regenerative capacity can be further enhanced by small molecules such as Repsox.









Abstract
The plasticity and regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle arise from quiescent stem cells activated upon overload, injury, or disease state. Developing in vitro muscle models to study these properties can advance muscle disease modeling and pre&#8208;clinical evaluation. Here, Filamented Light (FLight) bioprinting is leveraged as a high&#8208;throughput approach for producing mini&#8208;muscle tissues. Using paired box protein 7 (Pax7)&#8208;nGFP primary myoblasts, mini&#8208;muscles are bioprinted from pristine collagen&#8208;fibrinogen (ColFib). The FLight hydrogel consist of aligned microstructures which guide the formation of aligned myotubes. Mini&#8208;muscles demonstrates in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization, including multinucleated myotubes and a Pax7+ cell pool embedded in newly deposited laminin. Both spontaneous and electrically stimulated contractions are observed. ColFib matrix is promising for maintenance of the Pax7+ cell pool. Damage from cardiotoxin&#8208;induced injury of the mini&#8208;muscles led to a massive proliferation of Pax7+ cells and restoration of the contractile properties of myotubes. Notably, small molecules such as Repsox can enhance regeneration. FLight printed mini&#8208;muscles have potential for applications in muscle biology, exercise/atrophy, disease models, and drug screening.

         <title>Giant Flexoelectric&#8208;Like Response via Macroscopic Symmetry Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance flexoelectricity by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameters and device structure is proposed. The centrosymmetric piezoelectric bimorph cantilever exhibits a flexoelectric coefficient of 1.47 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1, and the mirror&#8208;symmetric one with spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes achieves a record&#8208;high value of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1. This strategy can guide the design of high&#8208;performance flexoelectric devices.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity is enabled by symmetry in all materials. However, flexoelectric material application is limited by the normally low charge density produced in bulk materials. In this study, a universal strategy involving a macroscopic symmetry design is proposed to enhance the flexoelectricity. Through theoretical derivation, flexoelectricity can be improved by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameter distribution (including the piezoelectric coefficients) and device structure. As a demonstration, typical piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers (PBCs; Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag) are constructed with the two PZT&#8208;5H layers arranged in &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (mirror symmetry) and &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (centrosymmetry), to design the macroscopic symmetry and thus to tune the flexoelectricity. The theoretical predictions and experimental results show that the tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC achieves a flexoelectric coefficient (1.47 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1), 20 times higher than that of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC (7 &#215; 104 nC m&#8722;1) and conventional piezoelectric cantilevers (Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag). Furthermore, by introducing spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes, the macroscopic symmetry of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC can be transformed from mirror to centrosymmetry, yielding a giant flexoelectric coefficient of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1. This strategy offers a dimension beyond traditional approaches for understanding and enhancing flexoelectricity, paving the way for its practical application.

         <title>Piezoelectric Injectable Anti&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel to Promote Endogenous Healing of Tendon Injuries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel promotes Achilles tendon healing, forming a barrier to prevent adhesion and inflammation, and accelerates repair via piezoelectricity, offering a new clinical treatment strategy.








Abstract
Achilles tendon rupture has become a common sports injury nowadays, but tendon repair is still is a challenge in the clinical practice. Tendon adhesion, which results from exogenous healing, is a crucial problem impairing tendon repair. Meanwhile, insufficient endogenous healing from the tendon stem cells, makes tendon repair even more difficult. Here, a piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (PE&#8208;IAH) is reported, which can simutaneously promote endogenous healing while inhibiting exogenous healing in the tendon repair process. The in vivo study reveals that the PE&#8208;IAH can form a physical barrier in situ at the tendon injury site, which reduces the inflammatory response and effectively prevents the tendon from adhering to surrounding tissue. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric short fibers incorporated in the hydrogel can evidently promotes the proliferation and differentiation of tendon stem cells due to piezoelectric effect under ultrasound excitation. Altogethter, the PE&#8208;IAH successfully accelerates the endogenous healing of tendon in addition to the anti&#8208;adhesion purpose, resulting in remarkably elevated tendon functions (Achilles Functional Index: &#8722;15.6 of PE&#8208;IAH versus &#8722;30.6 of injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (IAH), Day 14). This study provides a new strategy for advanced healing and functional recovery of Achilles tendon, which is promising to become a potential clinical treatment option.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achilles tendon rupture has become a common sports injury nowadays, but tendon repair is still is a challenge in the clinical practice. Tendon adhesion, which results from exogenous healing, is a crucial problem impairing tendon repair. Meanwhile, insufficient endogenous healing from the tendon stem cells, makes tendon repair even more difficult. Here, a piezoelectric injectable anti-adhesive hydrogel (PE-IAH) is reported, which can simutaneously promote endogenous healing while inhibiting exogenous healing in the tendon repair process. The in vivo study reveals that the PE-IAH can form a physical barrier in situ at the tendon injury site, which reduces the inflammatory response and effectively prevents the tendon from adhering to surrounding tissue. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric short fibers incorporated in the hydrogel can evidently promotes the proliferation and differentiation of tendon stem cells due to piezoelectric effect under ultrasound excitation. Altogethter, the PE-IAH successfully accelerates the endogenous healing of tendon in addition to the anti-adhesion purpose, resulting in remarkably elevated tendon functions (Achilles Functional Index: &#8722;15.6 of PE-IAH versus &#8722;30.6 of injectable anti-adhesive hydrogel (IAH), Day 14). This study provides a new strategy for advanced healing and functional recovery of Achilles tendon, which is promising to become a potential clinical treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Edge&#8208;Dislocated WO3 Photocathode Toward Efficient Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the photoexcitation properties of Li2O2, a strategy for constructing a Z&#8208;type heterojunction at the photocathode@Li2O2 interface is proposed for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. This Z&#8208;type heterojunction acts as a charge modulation channel for carrier dynamics within Li2O2 through photocathode modifications. By utilizing edge dislocation &#8208;WO3 as the photocathode, both high capacity and low overpotential are achieved.








Abstract
The operation of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 batteries critically depends on the highly reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode. However, the intrinsic insulating nature of Li2O2 fundamentally restricts reaction kinetics, posing a core challenge to practical applications. Here, it is demonstrate that the insulating properties of Li2O2 can be effectively improved by photoexcitation, attributed to the generation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers. It is inspired to develop photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries featuring Z&#8208;type photocathode@Li2O2 heterojunction, which serves as a charge modulation channel to regulate carrier dynamics through photocathode modifications. By employing edge&#8208;dislocated WO3 as the photocathode, sustained growth of Li2O2 films is observed with a thickness &gt;18&#160;&#181;m, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than typically reported values. Benefiting from the enhanced exciton dissociation of Li2O2 and improved oxidative capability of photocathode, the battery delivers an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 31&#160;800&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and a light&#8208;induced temperature of &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. In addition, a low polarization overpotential of 0.04&#160;V is achieved with high reversibility over 1&#160;000 h. The grasp of photoexcited Li2O2 within Li&#8208;O2 batteries can drive solutions beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Electric Field Induced High Performance Graphene/LiNbO3 Dynamic Diode Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 dynamic diode generator (DDG) demonstrated an ultra&#8208;high voltage output exceeding 41&#160;V, attributed to the coupling enhancement between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO&#8323; surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface, thus opening up a novel avenue for the efficient harvesting of environmental mechanical energy.








Abstract
Substantial endeavors have been dedicated to continuously harvesting mechanical energy from the environment, where dynamic semiconductor diode generators (DDGs) have recently been drawing significant attention as the miniature, portable in situ energy device. However, despite their unique advantages of direct&#8208;current output and high current density, the output voltage of DDG is usually less than 1 V, which needs to be further improved to satisfy the demands of practical applications. Therefore, this study proposes a vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG that is conducive to an ultra&#8208;high voltage output. The coupling enhancement effect arising from the synergy between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO3 surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface has been identified as a key factor in achieving an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage output of 41.3 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.53 &#181;A. The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG can effectively power an LED without the requirement of an external energy storage and conversion circuit. Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding stability, showing no evident performance attenuation after continuous operation exceeding 3 h. The graphene/LiNbO3 DDG has enhanced the feasibility of real&#8208;time energy supply for electronic components and paved the way for the efficient harvesting of mechanical energy from the environment.

Mimicking energy transduction in prototissue assemblies remains a challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this work, prototissues integrating protocells with photothermal gold nanoparticle proto&#8208;organelles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These prototissues exhibited light&#8208;controlled reversible contractions, programmable motions, and dynamic control of enzymatic metabolism by restricting substrate access, pioneering a route toward bioinspired materials with emergent energy transduction behaviors.








Abstract
Despite recent significant advances in the controlled assembly of protocell units into complex 3D architectures, the development of prototissues capable of mimicking the sophisticated energy transduction processes fundamental to living tissues remains a critical unmet challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here a synthetic approach is described to start addressing this challenge and report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of a photonastic prototissue endowed with photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction capabilities. For this, novel protocells enclosing photothermal transducing proto&#8208;organelles based on gold nanoparticles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These advanced protocell units are assembled into prototissues capable of light&#8208;induced reversible contractions and complex motions, which can be exploited to reversibly switch off a coordinated internalized enzyme metabolism by blocking the access of small substrate molecules. Overall, the work provides a synthetic pathway to constructing prototissues with sophisticated energy transduction mechanisms, enabling the rational design of emergent behaviors in synthetic materials and addressing critical challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and bioinspired materials engineering.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is used for the fabrication of polarization&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable optical device. The &#960;V&#8208;LCLC EC optical device has the potential for advancing optical applications.








Abstract
To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length of viologen, the &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation&#8208;radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear&#8208;coating and molecular self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;p&gt;The newly synthesized &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended viologen-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is used for the fabrication of polarization-dependent and color-tunable optical device.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended viologen-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugation length of viologen, the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation-radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear-coating and molecular self-assembly. Subsequent photopolymerization of the uniaxially oriented &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC film significantly enhances its mechanical and chemical stability while enabling polarization-dependent transmittance and distinct color transitions. This newly developed &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC RM facilitates the fabrication of energy-efficient EC optical devices with tunable transmittance and multicolor modulation, and it is operable at a low voltage of 2.5 V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Control of Liposomal Drug Release by Drug&#8211;Aptamer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an aptamer&#8208;enhanced liposomal drug release platform is developed that controls the release of various drugs through a mechanism involving both specific drug affinity and impedance of diffusion. As in vivo proof of principle, this platform provides prolonged local anesthesia for up to 6.6 d following a single dose of tetrodotoxin (TTX) injected at the sciatic nerve in rats.








Abstract
Conventional diffusion&#8208;controlled drug delivery systems (DDS) can have undesirable initial burst release, leading to potential systemic toxicity, and the rate of basal release can deplete content, shortening the duration of effect. Here, it is hypothesized that conventional drug delivery systems&#8212;using liposomes as an example&#8212;can be enhanced by incorporation of an aptamer that binds specifically to the encapsulated drug. Affinity of the aptamer to the drug within liposomes (Lipo&#8208;Apt) would slow release. It is demonstrated that this approach works with a range of relatively small and hydrophilic molecules, including tetrodotoxin (TTX), serotonin (Ser), and kanamycin (Kan). The in vivo utility of this system in providing prolonged local anesthesia with TTX injected at the sciatic nerve in rats is further demonstrated. A single injection of TTX&#8208;loaded Lipo&#8208;Apt results in 6.6 d of nerve blockade, a fourfold improvement over the duration achieved by liposomes without aptamers, and 26&#8208;fold over the aptamer&#8211;drug complex. In part, the improved efficacy of Lipo&#8208;Apt is also due to slower release reducing systemic toxicity, which allows delivery of larger drug doses. These studies demonstrate that Lipo&#8208;Apt is a promising approach to enhancing control of release of drugs by DDS, reducing toxicity and enhancing duration of effect.

         <title>A k Descriptor to Design of Current Collectors for Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study mathematically derives three key parameters, dielectric coefficient, interfacial concentration change, and ion mobility, critical to current collector design, and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Guided by these theoretical insights, this study experimentally develops a free&#8208;standing current collector that exhibits optimal plating/stripping performance and extended cycle life of 24&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free strategy enables exceptionally high energy density in rechargeable metal batteries, but the lack of theoretical frameworks impedes current collector design. Here, this study mathematically derives three critical parameters: dielectric coefficient (&#603;), ion mobility (&#181;_C), and the change of concentration (&#948;C_C), and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Experimentally, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based current collector is fabricated with minimized &#603;, enhanced &#948;C_C (nano/micro&#8208;Sb particles), and &#181;_C (sodium carboxymethylcellulose, CMC&#8208;Na). The optimized design achieves remarkable cycling stability&#8208;over 24 months at 0.25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and 12 months even at a high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2. The lowest k value aligns with half&#8208;cell tests, validating this theory. This work establishes a quantitative framework for designing high&#8208;efficiency anode&#8208;free sodium battery current collectors.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Green Solvent&#8208;Processed 2D Nanomaterials for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocross&#8208;linking strategy is proposed for the patterning and integration of scalable vertical van der Waals heterostructures such as field&#8208;effect transistors, logic gates, and memory devices composed of 2D nanomaterials by UV light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linker in isopropyl alcohol. To optimize the alcohol&#8208;based dispersion system, Hansen solubility parameter analysis is performed to identify a solvent capable of simultaneously stabilizing both the 2D nanomaterials and the cross&#8208;linker.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed 2D nanomaterials have emerged as key building blocks for the large&#8208;scale assembly of functional electronic devices. Solution processing enables the formation of electronically active percolated networks by leveraging van der Waals (vdW) interactions between individual 2D nanosheets. While effective vdW interactions are expected to minimize potential energy barriers and contact resistances between nanosheets, undesired residues from material synthesis or device fabrication processes may remain at the interface. In particular, the ideal solvent candidates for optimizing the stability of 2D dispersions are typically difficult to remove due to their high boiling points and exhibit environmental toxicity. Additionally, conventional patterning processes require multiple solvents, which can disrupt vdW interfaces and degrade device performance. To address these challenges, a comprehensive process that combines 2D dispersion preparation with a cross&#8208;linker&#8208;based direct photopatterning technique is developed using an eco&#8208;friendly green solvent. To enable this process, the stability of 2D nanomaterials and ultraviolet light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linkers is thoroughly analyzed using Hansen solubility parameters. The developed process successfully enables the preparation of stable dispersions of cross&#8208;linkers and 2D nanomaterials, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten diselenide, and hafnium disulfide, which can then be assembled via vdW interactions to create large&#8208;scale functional electronic devices.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Achieving Efficient Phosphorescent Carbon Nanodots in Aqueous Solution by Suppressing Triplet Electron Leakage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning reveals that increasing matrix thickness reduces triplet exciton leakage, establishing a data&#8208;guided design paradigm for water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent CNDs with ultrahigh efficiency. 








Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted synthesis has emerged as a prevalent strategy for the fabrication of solid&#8208;state phosphorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs), yet achieving efficient liquid&#8208;phase CND systems remains challenging due to complex underlying mechanisms. The knowledge gap poses a substantial barrier to translating phosphorescent CND systems between solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;phase configurations. Herein, the critical role of triplet electron leakage is elucidated in reducing the phosphorescent performance of CNDs and demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can be applied to suppress this leakage, achieving efficient phosphorescent CNDs in aqueous solution. By integrating experimental datasets from hundreds of systematically designed syntheses, an interpretable ML model capable of predicting and tuning phosphorescence lifetimes in CND systems is developed. The quantitative relationships between features and lifetimes using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are established, revealing an inverse correlation between matrix thickness and the probability of triplet electron leakage. Guided by the developed ML model, efficient phosphorescent CNDs are achieved in aqueous solution with an emission duration lifetime of exceeding10&#160;s and a phosphorescent quantum yield of over 10%. This study establishes a conceptual and methodological framework for engineering high&#8208;performance phosphorescent nanomaterials in liquid&#8208;phase systems.

         <title>Enhancing N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance via Blending Alkyl and Oligoglycol Functionalized Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending hydrophobic and hydrophilic n&#8208;type conjugated polymers in precise ratios enhances charge carrier mobility and dramatically improves organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance. This strategy demonstrates how molecular interactions and phase compatibility within polymer blends can be engineered to tune microstructure and transport properties, providing a versatile design approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECT materials.








Abstract
Compared to their p&#8208;type counterparts, n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) generally exhibit inferior stability, slower ion injection kinetics, and reduced sensitivity when used as the active layer in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next&#8208;generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, how blending two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance is investigated. Specifically, NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains, are examined. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the &#181;C* product declines sharply. The enhancement in &#181;C* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (&#181;), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) is used to visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in &#181;C*. Overall, this study highlights polymer blending as a promising strategy for improving the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Borohydride Doping in Electrochemical Stability of Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how LiBH4 doping in argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte improves electrochemical stability by forming a tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that promotes ion transport and blocks electrons. In situ XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS show thinner SEI, enhanced Li electrodeposition, and better interfacial wetting compared to baseline LPSCl, highlighting the role of B&#8208;rich layers in interface engineering.









Abstract
This work elucidates the mechanism by which lithium borohydride (LiBH4) doping into argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl (LBH&#8208;LPSCl) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) enhances electrochemical stability. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance is achieved with 5 wt% borohydride. Symmetric cells achieve critical current density (CCD) of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2, versus 2.6 mA cm&#8722;2 for baseline&#8208;LPSCl. All solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing lithium metal and NMC811 cathode are stable over 400 cycles at 0.5C, with capacity retention of 83%. An anode&#8208;free ASSB (AF&#8208;ASSB) is stable over 600 cycles, with capacity loss of 0.04% per cycle. 5LBH&#8208;LPSCl allows for enhanced low temperature operation, down to &#8722;14&#160;&#176;C. Yet the difference in electrolytes&#8217; bulk microstructures and hardnesses are minimal, while ionic conductivity is incrementally improved (&#8776;50%). Theoretical modeling indicates limited effect of substitution on thermodynamic stability of PS43&#8722; units, which decompose when contacting Li. Instead, enhanced electrochemical stability is site&#8208;specific kinetic effect: In situ electrodeposition experiments using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) reveal tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that blocks electrons while facilitating ion transport. This SEI manifests reduced interface resistance and accelerated nucleation and growth of metallic Li. With baseline&#8208;LPSCl the SEI based on Li3P/Li2S is substantially thicker, generating localized stresses that promote interfacial cracking while cycling.

         <title>Quantitatively Predicting Angle&#8208;Resolved Polarized Raman Intensity of Anisotropic Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops comprehensive methodologies to predict angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity profiles of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), spanning from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit. By considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference, the complex refractive indexes and intrinsic Raman tensors are determined, offering a robust framework for ARPR analysis of ALM flakes across various dielectric structures.








Abstract
Angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy provides insights into optical anisotropy and symmetry&#8208;related electron&#8211;photon/electron&#8211;phonon couplings of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs). However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (&#10878;20 nm) flakes and four&#8208;layer Td&#8208;WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically&#8208;thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in&#8208;plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, are derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer&#8208;dependent electronic&#160;properties.

A fast&#8208;charging graphite anode (C@MEG) with rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport and low interfacial resistance is demonstrated for Ah&#8208;level lithium&#8208;ion pouch batteries, offering high energy density, high power density, short charging time and long cycle life.

Abstract
The exponential growth of electric vehicle industry necessitates to rapidly develop fast&#8208;charging technology for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the mainstream graphite anode encounters significant challenges in fast&#8208;charging scenarios, including capacity decay and shortened lifespan caused by the sluggish lithiation kinetics and unstable solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, the kilogram&#8208;level scalable production of ultrafast&#8208;charging anode (C@MEG) consisting of micro&#8208;expanded graphite coated by an ultrathin disordered carbon layer (5&#160;nm) is reported, which simultaneously compensates for the conventional limitation of internal lithium diffusion kinetics and reconfigures the external electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This uniqueness endows rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport, with minimized electrode polarization, enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior, and reduced interface impedance. At an ultrafast&#8208;charging rate of 10 C, this Li||C@MEG cell exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 157 mAh g&#8722;1, superior to pristine graphite (71 mAh g&#8722;1) and previously reported graphite anodes. Moreover, this assembled 1 Ah&#8208;level C@MEG||LiCoO2 pouch battery delivers remarkable fast&#8208;charging cyclability, showcasing 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under 3 A, together with high power density around 1500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 under 10 A, corresponding to a short charging time of only 4.2 min, demonstrative of applicability. This work presents a practical scalable fast&#8208;charging anode toward high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power and long&#8208;life batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The exponential growth of electric vehicle industry necessitates to rapidly develop fast-charging technology for lithium-ion batteries. However, the mainstream graphite anode encounters significant challenges in fast-charging scenarios, including capacity decay and shortened lifespan caused by the sluggish lithiation kinetics and unstable solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, the kilogram-level scalable production of ultrafast-charging anode (C@MEG) consisting of micro-expanded graphite coated by an ultrathin disordered carbon layer (5&#160;nm) is reported, which simultaneously compensates for the conventional limitation of internal lithium diffusion kinetics and reconfigures the external electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This uniqueness endows rapid surface-to-bulk lithium transport, with minimized electrode polarization, enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior, and reduced interface impedance. At an ultrafast-charging rate of 10 C, this Li||C@MEG cell exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 157 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to pristine graphite (71 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and previously reported graphite anodes. Moreover, this assembled 1 Ah-level C@MEG||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch battery delivers remarkable fast-charging cyclability, showcasing 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under 3 A, together with high power density around 1500&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 10 A, corresponding to a short charging time of only 4.2 min, demonstrative of applicability. This work presents a practical scalable fast-charging anode toward high-energy, high-power and long-life batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terminations Determine Energy&#8208;Level Alignment of Perovskite Buried Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the widely&#8208;reported &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221; in perovskite field is disclosed as the varying combinations of perovskite terminations at the buried interface. The substrate influences the electronic structure of the perovskite through inducing electron&#8208;transfer within different perovskite slabs near the interface. These findings highlight the potential of termination engineering to enhance the performance of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221;, where the semiconduction type of perovskite changes according to that of the substrate is a widely&#8208;reported, but so far not fully understood phenomenon in the field of perovskite. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of probing and comprehending the electronic properties of perovskite buried interfaces. Here, through broadly investigating 20 buried interfaces formed between different perovskites and organic hole or electron transport materials (HTMs or ETMs), it is revealed that the substrate&#8208;effect originates from the distinct energy&#8208;level alignments at HTM or ETM substrates. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this difference stems from varying proportions of two perovskite terminations, which are determined by the interaction between substrates and perovskite crystals. With such mechanism, the semiconduction type of perovskite by controlling the proportion of surface terminations is successfully tuned. These findings provide new insights into optimizing device performance through termination engineering.

         <title>Anchoring Unimolecular Metal Chloride as a Sterically Active Site for Conformal Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated MnCl2N4 structure anchored on hard carbon tailors the electronic environment of single atoms to lower zinc nucleation barriers. Chloride&#8208;assisted Zn adsorption with Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and residual Zn enables reduced overpotential. The resulting Zn&#8211;carbon composite anode delivers enhanced cycling stability and electrochemical performance in full cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the practical application of zinc metal anodes is hindered by the challenge of uncontrollable zinc&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, axial&#8208;coordinated manganese single atoms, anchored by N, Cl co&#8208;coordinating on self&#8208;standing carbon nanofibers, are designed to guide uniform Zn deposition. The MnCl2N4 octahedral sites act as effective nucleation centers, significantly reducing the Zn adsorption energy of the carbon matrix, achieving a nucleation overpotential of 17&#160;mV. The strong interaction between Zn and MnCl2N4 sites stabilizes the initially adsorbed Zn2+ through John&#8208;Teller distortions, which in turn promotes subsequent zinc adsorption. In symmetric cells, the Mn&#8208;modified carbon nanofiber electrodes exhibit excellent cycling stability with a lifespan of 200 h under a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a full cell coupling a MnO2 cathode with a Mn&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber anode delivers outstanding cycling performance over 1400 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of axially coordinated single&#8208;atom metals in regulating zinc deposition, offering a pathway toward durable and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>GHz&#8208;Speed Wavefront Shaping Metasurface Modulators Enabled by Resonant Electro&#8208;Optic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces using a silicon&#8208;on&#8208;lithium niobate platform are presented, achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the high quality factor resonance of the Si nanobar. Using this resonant nanoantenna platform, a beamsplitting metasurface device is developed, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. This platform provides a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing devices.








Abstract
Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, optical efficiency, and tuning response. Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range are presented. The resonant electro&#8208;optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin&#8208;film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q &gt; 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free&#8208;space light. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonance of the nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. Absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with &#177;5 V applied voltage is demonstrated, and the modulation dependence on the resonance quality factor is shown. Additionally, the modulation bandwidth of these devices exceeds 800 MHz, and the electrode limitations on this bandwidth are studied. Finally, how this resonant antenna platform can enable wavefront shaping metasurfaces is shown. A beamsplitting metasurface device is demonstrated, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high&#8208;speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing&#160;devices.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Polarization&#8208;Sensitive O&#8208;Doped ZrTe3 Photodetector Induced by UV Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector based on UV&#8208;laser&#8208;treated ZrTe3 is constructed with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers. It operates from 355 nm to 1.43 mm without antenna integration, delivering a responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 and fast rise/fall times of 729ns/14.9 &#956;s$\umu{\rm s}$. The device exhibits long&#8208;term air stability, enabling room&#8208;temperature multidimensional detection across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation photodetectors demand multidimensional information perception, high responsivity, and low noise equivalent power across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range. Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on anisotropic low&#8208;dimensional materials offer a promising solution, yet inherent material properties impose severe performance trade&#8208;offs. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing an ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers, fabricated via UV laser treatment of semi&#8208;metallic ZrTe3. The results demonstrate that the ZrTe3 polarization photodetector achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral polarized light response from UV to terahertz (355 nm&#8211;1.43 mm) with antenna&#8208;free integration at room temperature. Notably, it exhibits a high responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 with rise/fall times of 729 ns/14.9 &#181;s at 532 nm. One&#8208;year&#8208;long photoresponse tests in air demonstrate stability for ultra&#8208;broadband ZrTe3 polarization detector (UBPD). This work highlights the transformative potential of ZrTe3 for future wide&#8208;spectrum polarization&#8208;sensitive&#160;applications.

         <title>Graphdiyne Production in a Flash: High&#8208;Yield Direct Synthesis by Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work creatively introduces an electron beam irradiation strategy that enables the deprotection&#8208;free synthesis of GDY directly from HEB&#8208;TMS under ambient conditions, achieving almost 100% yields within seconds&#8212;the shortest time reported to date, to the best of the&#160;knowledge. This ultrafast and efficient method significantly improves over traditional approaches, which often require hours or days of thermal treatment.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, holds immense potential for diverse applications but is severely constrained by relatively complex and time&#8208;intensive synthesis methods. Here, a novel electron beam irradiation strategy is reported that enables the ultrafast and scalable synthesis of GDY directly from its protected monomer, hexakis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS), under ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of the direct use of electron beam irradiation in carbon materials synthesis, achieving the shortest synthesis time for GDY from HEB&#8208;TMS reported to date. This unprecedented efficiency arises from the rapid in situ formation of copper acetylide intermediates, followed by electron&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage to generate alkynyl radicals that undergo efficient homo&#8208;coupling into GDY. Moreover, this flash approach enables the in situ formation of uniformly dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles on GDY, resulting in a composite with exceptional efficiency and stability for the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. By providing a green, scalable, and efficient synthetic route, this work not only marks a leap toward GDY production but also establishes a versatile platform for designing GDY&#8208;based catalysts, paving the way for broader applications and industrial&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Magnetically &#8220;Programming&#8221; Cobalt&#8208;Doped Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Localized Induction Heating: Triggering a Collective Effect of Magnetic Moment Alignment on Demand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates enhanced induction heating in cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide nanoparticles via specific pre&#8208;magnetization, induced by the pre&#8208;alignment of magnetic moments. By correlating Co content with magnetic properties, the research highlights how magnetic pre&#8208;programming enables localized, on&#8208;demand debonding in composites. These findings offer future applications in industrial recycling, emphasizing the potential of a switchable magnetic memory in advanced systems.








Abstract
Induction heating, a contactless and efficient method for generating heat via alternating magnetic fields (AMFs), has evolved from simple thermal applications to precise process control in fields like catalysis, self&#8208;healing, and debonding. Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) play a key role as heat mediators, with heating properties adjustable via composition, size, and interactions. However, spatially precise heat control remains challenging. Current strategies rely on external AMF adjustments or material modifications, but lack an inherent mechanism to predefine which particles or regions will be activated for induction heating, limiting applicability in structured materials or complex environments. Here, it is shown that pre&#8208;magnetizing cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide NPs with a static magnetic field irreversibly enhances their heating rates by up to a factor of 40. This process permanently alters their magnetic properties, enabling selective heating independent of AMF modulation. The extent of activation scales with cobalt content, introducing a material&#8208;intrinsic thermal switch. Furthermore, assembling these NPs into supraparticles facilitates integration into functional materials. By enabling spatially resolved and selective heat generation, this strategy advances the control of induction heating at the material level. It opens new possibilities for on&#8208;demand, pre&#8208;programmable, spatially resolved thermal activation in composite materials, smart adhesives, and targeted energy delivery in complex systems.

         <title>Innate Immunity&#8208;Guided Macrophage&#8208;Homing Nanoplatform for Oral Tumor Immunotherapy and Real&#8208;Time Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging in Pre&#8208;Clinical Models</title>

An oral, innate immunity&#8208;guided tumor&#8208;homing nanoplatform leverages the migratory behavior of macrophages to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug for immunotherapy and Ag2Te quantum dots for NIR&#8208;II imaging. At the tumor site, &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 reprograms macrophages to enhance immune responses, reduce fibrosis, and improve treatment efficacy, while Ag2Te enables real&#8208;time deep&#8208;tissue imaging of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and a high propensity for liver metastasis. This study presents an innate immunity&#8208;guided, macrophage (M&#934;)&#8208;homing nanoplatform that enables oral delivery of theranostic agents to PDAC lesions by harnessing the migratory behavior of endogenous M&#934; toward tumor&#8208;derived immune cues. The nanoplatform integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug&#8212;constructed by conjugating &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus) with the immunomodulator resiquimod (R848) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linker&#8212;and Ag2Te quantum dots (QDs) for near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, forming &#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te nanoparticles (NPs). Upon oral administration, &#946;Glus facilitates the selective uptake of NPs by intestinal M&#934; (&#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te NPs@M&#934;), which subsequently migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). There, elevated ROS levels trigger the release of R848, reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated M&#934; from an immunosuppressive M2 to an immunoactive M1 phenotype. This immune activation remodels the stroma, enhances T cell infiltration, and transforms the TME into an immunoactive state, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, Ag2Te QDs enable deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;II imaging for real&#8208;time visualization of PDAC progression, liver metastasis, and treatment response. Guided by innate immune signals, this M&#934;&#8208;homing theranostic platform offers a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in PDAC treatment by integrating targeted immunotherapy with noninvasive, real&#8208;time disease monitoring.

         <title>The Synergy Between In Situ Gradient Polymerization and Phase Separation Enables Practical Solid&#8208;State Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

A gradient&#8208;polymerized solid polymer electrolyte with petaloid phase separation is developed via in situ polymerization. It delivers high ionic conductivity (1.5 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;1) and excellent cathode compatibility, enabling high&#8208;performance full cells for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional safety property. However, most of the previously reported SPEs cannot well match with high&#8208;loading and high&#8208;voltage cathodes due to their low ionic conductivity and limited anodic stability. Herein, a SPE with superior compatibility with high&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich cathodes is generated by in situ gradient polymerization of a deep eutectic electrolyte. Besides, a polymerization&#8208;induced petaloid phase separation structure enhances interfacial ion transport, resulting in a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled high&#8208;loading (19.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM811||graphite full battery exhibites a high capacity retention of 85.3% after 200 cycles and outstanding rate performance (1 C). Industrial 1.2 Ah NCM811||SiOx pouch cell demonstrates unprecefented energy density of 382&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Moreover, this SPE also exhibits significantly enhanced safety characteristics, delaying the onset temperature of heat release from 157&#160;&#176;C to 266&#160;&#176;C and thermal runaway temperature from 198&#160;&#176;C to 312&#160;&#176;C. This study provides a general and practical avenue to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

As a result, the as-assembled high-loading (19.5&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) NCM811||graphite full battery exhibites a high capacity retention of 85.3% after 200 cycles and outstanding rate performance (1 C). Industrial 1.2 Ah NCM811||SiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell demonstrates unprecefented energy density of 382&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, this SPE also exhibits significantly enhanced safety characteristics, delaying the onset temperature of heat release from 157&#160;&#176;C to 266&#160;&#176;C and thermal runaway temperature from 198&#160;&#176;C to 312&#160;&#176;C. This study provides a general and practical avenue to high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Platinum&#8208;free hydrogen photocatalysis is achieved using dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide&#8208;based conjugated polymers, self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles via nanoprecipitation. Through side chain engineering and donor&#8211;acceptor design, these materials reach a hydrogen evolution rate of 209 mmol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. The structure&#8211;function insights presented here establish rational design principles for efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable organic photocatalysts.








Abstract
While the interest in hydrogen photocatalysis from organic semiconductors is rapidly growing, there is a necessity to achieve hydrogen production without platinum (Pt), considering its price, availability and toxicity. In this work, this is demonstrated that high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiencies can be achieved without the use of Pt. A series of low&#8208;cost conjugated polymers are designed around the dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide (BTSO) unit, and self&#8208;assembled as nanoparticles in water via the nanoprecipitation technique. This is highlighted that how side chain engineering, nanoparticle morphology and pH influence the hydrogen evolution rate. Optoelectronic properties are improved through a Donor&#8208;Acceptor structure, resulting in an unprecedented hydrogen evolution reaction rate of 209&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of Pt. A clear correlation between high efficiencies and number of BTSO units within the polymer backbone can be established. The design rules pioneer the design of future organic materials is presented for a cost&#8208;efficient and sustainable hydrogen photocatalysis.

         <title>Topological Transformation of MXenes to Non&#8208;Van Der Waals Artificial Solids with Well&#8208;Defined Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is produced based on the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes by substitution with &#8208;S terminations and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal atoms. The resultant non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solids disclose a good structural stability, high catalytic activity, and superior adsorption capability toward iodine species, delivering good rate capabilities and cyclic stability in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (MXenes) have become an ideal platform to produce some derivatives with tunable chemical compositions and structures, possessing unique physical and chemical properties beyond their counterparts. Here, a well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is developed on the basis of the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes, which involves the substitution of &#8208;Cl with &#8208;S terminations to enlarge the interlayer spacing of MXenes and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, and Sn) atoms. After the topological transformation, the MXene layers are chemically bonded, showing a higher thermal stability up to 550&#160;&#176;C in air than that of MXenes. The resultant artificial solids with well&#8208;defined atomic metal layers exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity to I2/I&#8722; redox reaction and a strong adsorption capability toward iodine species. As a result, Zn&#8208;I2 batteries deliver a good rate performance of 104 mAh g&#8722;1 at 32 C and a long cycling stability of up to 2000 cycles at 8 C.

         <title>Ultrastrong Negative Thermal Expansion Compositionally Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative thermal expansion materials, crucial for crafting metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariance volume, face big challenges&#8212;need to not only maintain large negative thermal expansion over wide temperature range, but also harness strength and ductility. This work reports a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Ti compositionally complex alloy that meets these challenges, where nanoscale local chemical ordering dominates displacive transformation kinetics, giving rise to tunable macroscopic performances.








Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which are crucial for fabricating strong metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariant volumes, face significant challenges: they not only need to maintain a large thermal expansion over a wide temperature range but also need to harness strength and ductility for load&#8208;bearing applications. Unfortunately, most of these materials are brittle (compressive strength &lt; 1&#160;GPa), while the few ductile materials available have a narrow temperature range and significant thermal hysteresis. Herein, a compositionally complex Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ti alloy is reported exhibiting an excellent combination of large NTE over a wide temperature range with narrow thermal hysteresis, high compressive strength, and modest ductility. This unusual set of properties stems from the unique microstructure of the alloy, in which the matrix phase enables a unique kinetically sluggish thermoelastic martensitic transformation with a pronounced volumetric change, while the mechanically hard secondary phases contribute to the strengthening effect. An ultrahigh strength of up to 2.64&#160;GPa could be achieved by manipulating the nanoscale local chemical ordering, accompanied by tunable thermal expansion behavior. This study opens a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance functional materials.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Deficient Chain&#8208;Like Molecular Structure Confined Hydride Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Porous hydrogen&#8208;deficient LiNBH are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of LiNBH that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion.








Abstract
The practical application of LiBH4 in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) is hindered by low Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature, poor oxidative stability, and severe dendrite growth. Herein, porous [LiNBH]n with a hydrogen&#8208;deficient chain&#8208;like molecular structure are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of [LiNBH]n chains that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion. Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of [LiNBH]n chains induces the local electron localization of LiBH4 that enhances oxidative stability of LiBH4. Therefore, the Li ion conductivity of LiBH4 reaches 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LiBH4, with a voltage window of 5&#160;V. Moreover, the interaction between Li metal and [LiNBH]n chains results in in situ formation of ultrathin layer composed of Li3N and LiB alloys that hinders Li dendrites growth, leading to a critical current density value of 7.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cycling life of 100&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential of 125&#160;mV. Hence, LiCoO2|LiBH4&#8208;70LiNBH|Li cell at 0.5 C deliver a high capacity of 89.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode by Ion Flux Regulation and Micro&#8208;Corrosion Zone Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited reversibility of Zn anodes remains a key challenge impeding the practical development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous strategies&#8212;such as solvation&#8208;regulating additives and water&#8208;blocking surface coatings&#8212;are explored, they often face inherent limitations. In this work, a novel additive, ZnABL, synthesized via keto&#8208;enol isomerization, is introduced. ZnABL exhibits strong adsorption on the zinc surface and function through dual mechanisms: regulating Zn ion flux and spatially isolating micro&#8208;corrosion zones to mitigate zinc anode corrosion, finally improving the Zn anode reversibility. The method introduced in this paper offers valuable insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are receiving continuous attention as candidates for the next generation batteries, but the poor reversibility of the Zn anode limits their further development. In recent years, researchers are obsessed with modifying the surface of the Zn anode and adjusting the solvation structure of Zn2+ to address these challenges. Here, we propose a novel strategy to improve the reversibility of the Zn anode by simultaneously regulating the Zn ion flux and dividing micro&#8208;corrosion zones on the Zn anode surface, thereby manipulating the deposition behavior of Zn2+ and relieving the corrosion of the Zn anode. This approach exploits the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (ABL) to develop a specifically designed additive: Zn2+ coordinated &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone complex (ZnABL). With this innovative additive, the Zn anodes show excellent reversibility: Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves a long cycle life of 7780&#160;h (&#8776;11 months). Furthermore, the Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;H2O near&#8208;ampere&#8208;hour pouch cell, featuring a high areal capacity of 7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2, achieved an energy density of 106.17&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and sustained more than 350 cycles. The success of ZnABL in modulating the Zn ion flux and compartmentalizing the micro&#8208;corrosion zone provides a novel option for the reversibility improvement of Zn anodes.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Spin Waves in Nanoscale Hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el Domain Walls Detected by Scanning X&#8208;Ray Microscopy in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropic Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>

         <dc:description>
Using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, nonreciprocal spin&#8208;wave behavior is revealed in real space in Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, highlighting their functionality for magnonic logic circuits operating at GHz frequencies. Topological defects disrupt phase continuity while preserving nonreciprocity, demonstrating the potential of these domain walls as programmable magnonic waveguides for directed information flow.








Abstract
Spin wave nonreciprocity is crucial for signal processing in magnonic circuits. Domain walls (DWs) have been suggested as channels for nonreciprocal spin waves (magnons) with directional&#8208;dependent properties. However, the experimental investigations are challenging due to the low&#8208;damping magnetic material with DWs demanded and the nanoscale length scales involved. In this study, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) is used to examine coherently&#8208;excited magnons when propagating in hybrid N&#233;el&#8208;Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Well&#8208;ordered lattices of stripe domains and DWs are created through the integration of Cobalt nanowire arrays. Their width is measured to be &#948;DW = (60 &#177; 13) nm. Near 1 GHz magnons are detected with short wavelengths down to &#955; = (281 &#177; 44)&#160;nm which were&#160;channeled in the DWs. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM data revealed a nonreciprocal magnon band structure inside the DWs. Bloch points are identified which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different &#955; adjacent to these topological defects. These observations provide direct evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el DWs in PMA materials, serving as programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information&#160;flow.

         <title>Achieving Abnormal Evaporation Behavior Using Melanin/Cellulose&#8208;Based Solar Evaporators via Salt Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bilayer aerogel with salt ion enrichment, demonstrating exceptional water management and photothermal performance. The aerogel exhibits a higher evaporation rate in high&#8208;salinity brines than in pure water, mitigating performance degradation from salt deposition and hydration effects in seawater desalination. Additionally, it exhibits excellent versatility and long lifetime, offering a viable solution for large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for seawater desalination, offering a potential remedy to the global water crisis. However, its widespread application is hindered by reduced performance in high&#8208;salinity brines and limited evaporator lifetimes. Inspired by natural melanins, amino acid&#8208;doped poly(norepinephrine) nanoparticles (PNE NPs) are developed as photothermal materials, encapsulated in a cellulose&#8208;based aerogel to form a 3D bilayer porous structure with salt ion enrichment effects. The interaction between the enriched ions in the aerogel weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, reducing evaporation enthalpy and enhancing evaporation rates. Under one sun illumination, the evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 4.06&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in high&#8208;concentration saline, surpassing the rate in pure water (3.51&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), with the rate increasing further as salt concentration rises. Notably, even the blank control group without photothermal materials shows an evaporation rate of 1.70&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the aerogel's strong intrinsic evaporation performance. The aerogel maintains its performance over five months of immersion in water without significant degradation. This low&#8208;cost, cellulose&#8208;based aerogel offers a promising solution to the issue of evaporation performance degradation in high&#8208;salinity brines, making large&#8208;scale solar desalination a feasible and effective option.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolved Proton Management by Harnessing Merocyanine&#8208;Integrated Hydrogels as Regenerative Photoacid Matrices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merocyanine photoacids are covalently integrated into hydrophilic polymer networks to develop regenerative photoacid matrices with excellent pH&#8208;switching performance retention through multiple regeneration cycles. This gelation strategy not only overcomes inherent solubility limitations and enhances their alkaline tolerance of conventional PAGs, but also enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled, shape&#8208;dependent proton release kinetics governed by diffusion.








Abstract
Photomanipulation of the environmental pH plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction kinetics and engineering material functionalities. While conventional merocyanine photoacids offer pH modulability, their practical implementation is fundamentally constrained by aqueous dissolution and laborious regeneration. Here, a transformative strategy is reported through the covalent integration of merocyanine photoacids into hydrophilic polymer networks to construct regenerative photoacid matrices, which stably retain protons in the dark and spatiotemporally liberate them upon illumination. The photoacid matrix overcomes solubility constraints through adjustable merocyanine grafting density while simultaneously enhancing alkaline stability, thereby enabling shape&#8208;governed, diffusion&#8208;controlled proton release kinetics. The universality of this approach has been extensively verified in multiple polymer matrices with variable chemical compositions. Upon straightforward separation and acidic regeneration in the dark, the recovered matrices sustainably maintain robust photoactivated proton release capability. This not only enables programmable control over acid&#8211;base indicator discoloration but also guides hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of arylazopyrazole&#8208;based hydrogelators, yielding 3D supramolecular gel architectures with tailored complexity. Furthermore, spatially controlled directional proton liberation are established through synergistically addressing negative phototropic deformation within a low&#8208;density crosslinked photoacid matrix.

&lt;p&gt;Merocyanine photoacids are covalently integrated into hydrophilic polymer networks to develop regenerative photoacid matrices with excellent pH-switching performance retention through multiple regeneration cycles. This gelation strategy not only overcomes inherent solubility limitations and enhances their alkaline tolerance of conventional PAGs, but also enables visible-light-controlled, shape-dependent proton release kinetics governed by diffusion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photomanipulation of the environmental pH plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction kinetics and engineering material functionalities. While conventional merocyanine photoacids offer pH modulability, their practical implementation is fundamentally constrained by aqueous dissolution and laborious regeneration. Here, a transformative strategy is reported through the covalent integration of merocyanine photoacids into hydrophilic polymer networks to construct regenerative photoacid matrices, which stably retain protons in the dark and spatiotemporally liberate them upon illumination. The photoacid matrix overcomes solubility constraints through adjustable merocyanine grafting density while simultaneously enhancing alkaline stability, thereby enabling shape-governed, diffusion-controlled proton release kinetics. The universality of this approach has been extensively verified in multiple polymer matrices with variable chemical compositions. Upon straightforward separation and acidic regeneration in the dark, the recovered matrices sustainably maintain robust photoactivated proton release capability. This not only enables programmable control over acid&#8211;base indicator discoloration but also guides hierarchical self-assembly of arylazopyrazole-based hydrogelators, yielding 3D supramolecular gel architectures with tailored complexity. Furthermore, spatially controlled directional proton liberation are established through synergistically addressing negative phototropic deformation within a low-density crosslinked photoacid matrix. This work creates a new paradigm for spatiotemporal pH manipulation in the development of autonomous materials through regenerative photoacid matrices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Like&#8208;Phase Confined Interfacial Polymerization: A Universal Platform for the Controlled 2D Growth of COP Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic abstract illustrates a solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) mechanism, which modulates substrate hydration, solvent density, and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions to localize Tp monomers at the substrate surface. This SLCIP strategy stabilizes the reaction interface, enabling confined 2D polymerization of the COP membrane within a restricted zone, ensuring controlled membrane growth and enhanced separation performance.








Abstract
The scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance covalent organic framework/polymer (COF/COP) membranes faces persistent challenges due to interfacial instability in conventional liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial polymerization (LLIP). Here, a transformative solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) strategy is developed that synergizes substrate hydration&#8208;induced confinement and functionalization&#8208;enabled monomer anchoring for synthesizing ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COP membranes. By orchestrating the hydration barrier and solvent density modulation at functionalized substrates, SLCIP converts the dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid interface into a stable solid&#8210;like phase confined interface. This interfacial confinement engineering enables the ambient synthesis of unique ultrathin COP membranes (&lt;40&#160;nm) via confined 2D reaction zones (1.2&#160;nm thickness via MD simulations). The resulting membranes achieve a record water permeance (161 L m&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; bar&#8315;&#185;, 3.7&#8208;fold enhancement over LLIP), with &gt;98.8% Congo red rejection. Systematic implementation across three solvent systems and five structurally diverse amine monomers demonstrates the universality and chemical adaptability of SLCIP. Industrial scalability is validated through pilot&#8208;scale fabrication of A4&#8208;sized membranes with &lt;5% spatial performance deviation. This work establishes an ambient&#8208;processable interfacial engineering paradigm, offering a sustainable platform for next&#8208;generation molecular separation technologies.

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Magnetic Particle Imaging: Tailored Magnetic Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is developed to optimize the magnetic diameter of magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced magnetic particle imaging. The resultant Fe310P exhibits an eight&#8208;fold increase in MPI signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer. Subsequent functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes yields Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, enabling ultrasensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastases as small as 0.5&#160;mm in diameter.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a groundbreaking imaging technique hindered by suboptimal tracers, as current magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are primarily designed for magnetic resonance imaging and are not specifically tailored for the distinct physics of MPI. To address this issue, optimizing the magnetic diameter of MNPs is focused on, a pivotal parameter influenced by both physical size and magnetic disorder, yet underexplored in the development of MPI tracers. By employing a precise temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy, this study successfully modulates these parameters synergistically to create high&#8208;performance Fe310P with an optimal magnetic diameter, exhibiting an eight&#8208;fold increase in the MPI signal in vitro compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax. Further surface functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes expressing a prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting antibody fragment (gy&#8208;1) yields tumor&#8208;targeted Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, which enables the detection of as few as 800 tumor cells with a single scan, without the need for repeated acquisitions. Compared to VivoTrax, Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1 achieves a 330&#8208;fold enhancement in the MPI signal in vivo, which enables the sensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastasis with 0.5&#160;mm in diameter. This study provides valuable insights into the development of advanced MPI tracers, paving the way for broader biomedical applications of MPI.

         <title>Unveiling the Mutual Promotion Mechanism of Adjacent Vacancy Defects Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mutual promotion of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite, and further develops a passivation strategy to synchronously passivate perovskite defects using a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine. The PSCs with active areas of 0.08 and 1 cm2 achieve champion PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, retaining 93% efficiency after 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination.








Abstract
The perovskite defect evolution directly impacts the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the mutual promotion mechanism of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite is unveiled, which means the cation/anion vacancy induces the adjacent anion/cation vacancy through decreasing the formation energy. This mutual promotion mechanism provides an explanation for the dynamic evolution of defects, and emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously passivating of adjacent defects. Accordingly, a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine is utilized to passivate adjacent defects, considering its adjacent electron&#8208;rich N atom, which can chemically bond uncoordinated Pb, and the hydrazine group, which can anchor FA+ through hydrogen bonds. Besides, this 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine also optimizes the perovskite crystallization through accelerating nucleation and slowing crystal growth, demonstrated by the in situ photoluminescence spectra. The resulting inverted 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 PSCs obtain PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, respectively. Moreover, the Target device shows enhanced stability by maintaining 93% and 90% of the initial efficiency after operating 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination and being exposed to harsh thermal cycling for 150 times, respectively.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Ion&#8208;Conductive Polyampholyte Elastomers via Dimeric Ionic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new class of polyampholyte ionic elastomers balancing both high mechanical strength and ionic conductivity by utilizing a novel precipitation method to create ionic dimers. The resulting elastomers exhibited strong mechanical performance and excellent ion mobility, making them ideal for applications in flexible electronics, wearable devices, and energy storage systems, particularly solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The development of ionic materials with high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength is challenging. This study presents a novel synthetic strategy for the development of a mechanically robust and ionically conductive polyampholyte elastomer based on ionic dimers (IDs) with strong ionic bonds between imidazolium and sulfonate. Polymerization of ID monomers with a network that forms a cross&#8208;linking moiety results in a novel polyampholyte ID elastomer (IDE). The addition of lithium (Li) salts in the IDE substantially enhances the ionic conductivity up to 0.82&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a high Li+ transference number (tLi&#8314;) of 0.79. The mechanical properties of the IDE with Li salts are remarkable, with a tensile strength of 27.4&#160;MPa and a Young's modulus of 211&#160;MPa, outperforming previous polyampholyte elastomers. A resistive&#8208;type iontronic sensor using the IDE exhibited excellent sensitivity (gauge factor&#160;=&#160;2.92) and reliable cycle performance (&#8776;400 cycles) under repetitive stress. The IDE serves as a polymer electrolyte in a pouch&#8208;type full cell, showing stable capacity at a high current density of 1.0 C (corresponding to 4.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 0.2&#160;MPa). This synthetic strategy offers a new approach for designing ionic materials with high conductivity and mechanical strength.

The mechanical properties of the IDE with Li salts are remarkable, with a tensile strength of 27.4&#160;MPa and a Young's modulus of 211&#160;MPa, outperforming previous polyampholyte elastomers. A resistive-type iontronic sensor using the IDE exhibited excellent sensitivity (gauge factor&#160;=&#160;2.92) and reliable cycle performance (&#8776;400 cycles) under repetitive stress. The IDE serves as a polymer electrolyte in a pouch-type full cell, showing stable capacity at a high current density of 1.0 C (corresponding to 4.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 0.2&#160;MPa). This synthetic strategy offers a new approach for designing ionic materials with high conductivity and mechanical strength.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultrafast Monovalent ZnCl+ Ion Transport in MOF&#8208;Based Zn Ion Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte through Polyanion Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MOF&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) is developed through the polyanion strategy. Thanks to the ultrafast transport of monovalent ZnCl+ ion, the ZGBC achieves a high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a high ionic transference number of 0.873 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transport of high&#8208;valence ions is a huge challenge, such as the transport of divalent zinc ions. Herein, a polyanion strategy is proposed to decrease divalent Zn2+ to monovalent ZnCl+, realizing ultrafast ion transport in solid&#8208;state electrolyte. An amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (ZGB&#8208;MOF) is designed and constructed as the matrix for solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The ZGB&#8208;MOF matrix is obtained by the Zn2+/Ga3+ competitive coordination process, enriching O&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl polyanion clusters, nanopores and C&#9552;O/oxygen vacancies active sites. The polyanion property of Ga3+ and physical limiting domains of nanopores promote the formation of ZnCl+. Abundant C&#9552;O and oxygen vacancies provide more transport sites, decreasing transport energy barriers for ZnCl+ (only 0.12&#160;eV). Eventually, the obtained Zinc ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) achieves high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high transference number of 0.873. More importantly, the ZGBC electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window (up to 2.88&#160;V) and high charging voltage (2.4&#160;V), and achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn&#8208;metal and stabilization of cathode materials. Full cells with ZGBC electrolyte and zinc hexacyanoferrate cathode exhibit excellent cycling stability, with no capacity degradation after 5000 cycles. This discovery could trigger new waves of enthusiasm for exploring new ion transport mechanisms beyond divalent Zn2+ transport.

         <title>Alternating Interlayered Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Heterojunction Boosts Sono&#8208;Piezocatalytic Pyroptosis Oncotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrative alternating&#8208;layered piezoelectronic nano&#8208;architecture has debuted, markedly enhancing ultrasound&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency and electron&#8208;storage capacity via robust electron confinement and heterojunction&#8208;mediated charge separation. Demonstrating catalytic and piezoelectric superiority over 29 benchmark nanocatalysts, this approach elevates microregional bio&#8208;responsiveness by amplifying atomic&#8208;level piezocatalytic mechanisms. These findings not only bridge catalysis with biomedical applications but also hold substantial promises for renewable energy conversion, environmental remediation, and advanced electron&#8208;transfer technologies.








Abstract
Recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers is a major barrier hindering the effectiveness of piezocatalytic oncotherapy. Herein, ultrathin oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered self&#8208;heterojunction bismuth oxysilicate (Ov&#8208;BOS) nanosheets with alternating hetero&#8208;layered nanostructure are constructed for enhanced sono&#8208;piezocatalytic tumor therapy. Benefiting from its out&#8208;of&#8208;plane asymmetry, Ov&#8208;BOS features an exceptional electromechanical strain coefficient (d*33 = 203 pm/V), highlighting its outstanding capability as a piezoelectric heterojunction for energy conversion. Particularly, the oxygen vacancy engineering facilitates the spatial redistribution of bands across the alternating [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers in Ov&#8208;BOS, promoting effective charge separation and stratified charge storage, thereby further suppressing recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers in a manner analogous to heterojunctions. Leveraging this strategy, Ov&#8208;BOS demonstrates efficient reactive oxygen species production and exhibits superior peroxidase and catalase&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional piezoelectric nanocatalysts. Consequently, the enhanced radical generation induced the specific cancer&#8208;cell pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 mediated gasdermin E&#8208;dependent pathway. Therefore, the engineered interlayer self&#8208;heterojunction provides an efficient strategy for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance piezoelectric nanocatalysts.

         <title>Fibrous Pressure Sensor with Unique Resistance Increase under Partial Compression: Coaxial Wet&#8208;Spun TiO2/Graphene/Thermoplastic Polyurethane Multi&#8208;Wall Multifunctional Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TGTMW fibers are designed to show a sharp resistance increase under pressure, as the multi&#8208;wall structure in the transition region between compressed and uncompressed areas bends and forms microcracks. This design breaks the physical sensitivity limit of conventional fiber&#8208;shaped pressure sensors, which usually show resistance reduction under pressure and are constrained by their series structure under partial compression.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure&#8208;sensitive sensors are rare. Although fibers are widely used in strain sensors owing to their structural advantages, developing fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure sensors is challenging. This challenge arises because the fiber acts as a series circuit along its axis, requiring increased resistance in the compressed region for a significant signal. Coaxial wet&#8208;spinning is used to create a multi&#8208;walled fiber. The outer layer, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/TiO2 slurry, ensured a smooth surface, while the inner core, containing 4% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), is extruded at 20&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1. Unlike conventional resistance&#8208;increasing pressure sensors, TGTMW fiber shows rising resistance under compression due to microcracks in its multi&#8208;wall structure. Its pressure sensitivity is evaluated using various 3D&#8208;printed indenters and showcasing its excellent performance. This sensor has found promising applications in remote motion detection, press or slide differentiation through wavelet transforms applied to high&#8208;speed sensing data, and real&#8208;time signal acquisition from a multi&#8208;channel sensing array. Additionally, intuitive visualization software is developed for the sensing array application and implemented a CNN&#8208;based machine learning algorithm for data analysis. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of &#8776;99.6% for 12 different compression modes. This work is believed to propose a new mechanism and design for fiber&#8208;based pressure sensors.

         <title>Interfacial Coordination Engineering to Boost Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Economic Zr&#8208;Based Halide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a coordination&#8208;driven amorphization strategy is employed to construct oxide&#8208;halide composite electrolytes by integrating Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) into Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO). The resulting composite electrolyte delivers high ionic conductivity, improved oxidative stability, and excellent cycling performance in ASSLBs, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable route toward high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (HSEs) have seen rapid progress in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), offering favorable lithium&#8208;ion transport properties, broad electrochemical stability, and strong interfacial compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. However, developing HSEs that simultaneously offer high ionic conductivity and low cost remains a significant challenge. Most high&#8208;conductivity halides rely on expensive metal elements, whereas cost&#8208;effective Zr&#8208;based halides are limited by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In this study, a new composite electrolyte (LA/LZCO) is developed via an interfacial coordination reaction between Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP). The coordination between PO43&#8722; groups in LATP and Zr4+ in LZCO induces local structural disorder, promoting LZCO amorphization. As a result, the ionic conductivity of LA/LZCO composite electrolyte is enhanced by more than twofold compared to LZCO, reaching 2.81 mS cm&#8722;1, among one of the highest reported for Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes. When integrated into ASSLBs with NCM83125 cathodes, the composite electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability, with 92.4% and 87.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C under 4.25&#160;V. Even at an elevated cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, 85.1% capacity is retained after 380 cycles, highlighting the promise of this composite strategy for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLBs.

     alt="Interfacial Coordination Engineering to Boost Li-Ion Conduction in Economic Zr-Based Halide Electrolytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a coordination-driven amorphization strategy is employed to construct oxide-halide composite electrolytes by integrating Li&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LATP) into Zr-based oxychlorides (LZCO). The resulting composite electrolyte delivers high ionic conductivity, improved oxidative stability, and excellent cycling performance in ASSLBs, offering a cost-effective and scalable route toward high-performance solid-state batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide solid electrolytes (HSEs) have seen rapid progress in the development of all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), offering favorable lithium-ion transport properties, broad electrochemical stability, and strong interfacial compatibility with high-voltage oxide cathodes. However, developing HSEs that simultaneously offer high ionic conductivity and low cost remains a significant challenge. Most high-conductivity halides rely on expensive metal elements, whereas cost-effective Zr-based halides are limited by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In this study, a new composite electrolyte (LA/LZCO) is developed via an interfacial coordination reaction between Zr-based oxychlorides (LZCO) and Li&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LATP). The coordination between PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups in LATP and Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in LZCO induces local structural disorder, promoting LZCO amorphization. As a result, the ionic conductivity of LA/LZCO composite electrolyte is enhanced by more than twofold compared to LZCO, reaching 2.81 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among one of the highest reported for Zr-based halide electrolytes. When integrated into ASSLBs with NCM83125 cathodes, the composite electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability, with 92.4% and 87.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C under 4.25&#160;V. Even at an elevated cut-off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, 85.1% capacity is retained after 380 cycles, highlighting the promise of this composite strategy for high-energy, long-life ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte with Long&#8208;Range Ordering and Compact Molecular Packing as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Efficient and Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of triphenylamine&#8208;based p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is designed and synthesized, exhibiting long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, which enables efficient hole transport and suppresses charge recombination. When employed as hole&#8208;transporting layer, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA delivered over 19% photovoltaic efficiency in rigid OSCs and demonstrated excellent mechanical durability in flexible devices.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) materials with a non&#8208;corrosive nature and good compatibility with flexible electrodes are highly desirable for advancing efficient and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) exhibit intriguing advantages as HTLs, such as tunable properties and excellent solution processability, but they suffer from poor charge&#8208;transporting properties, resulting in inferior performance to traditional HTLs. Herein, a series of pH&#8208;neutral CPEs are designed and synthesized that can form enhanced crystalline and highly ordered films. By tailoring trifluoromethyl substituents on the triphenylamine unit, TMPT&#8208;F exhibited exceptional long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, along with a crystalline coherence length of 2.56 nm and a laminar packing distance of 1.48 nm, ultimately yielding an unprecedented conductivity of 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S&#160;m&#8722;1 for the CPE&#8208;based HTL. The substantially enhanced charge&#8208;transporting property of the PMA&#8208;doped TMPT&#8208;F:PMA greatly suppressed the charge recombination in OSCs. The OSC modified by the TMPT&#8208;F:PMA HTL exhibited a PCE as high as 19.24%, which is superior to the PEDOT:PSS device. Moreover, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA showed excellent compatibility with flexible electrode, enabling a PCE of 16.52% for flexible OSC, and the device retained 83% of the initial PCE even after a 500&#8208;cycle bending at 5 mm radius.

         <title>Creep Localization Empowering High&#8208;Capacity Alloy Anodes for Durable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible In0.32Sn0.48Bi0.20 alloy anode with a titanium mesh having a high area moment of inertia is introduced. This approach effectively addresses electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation in ASSLBs under industrial conditions, enabling LiCoO2||Ti&#8208;InSnBi full&#8208;cells with exceptional energy densities exceeding 350 Wh kg&#8722;1, fast&#8208;charging capabilities up to 30.57 mA cm&#8722;2, and low stack pressures (3 MPa).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity alloy anodes (Si, Al, and Sn) promise critical materials for developing high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, their implementation remains fundamentally constrained by severe interfacial stress, large volume changes, and high stack pressures. Here, a novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy is proposed to address these intrinsic limitations by coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible (InSn4)0.37&#183;(InBi)0.63 alloy anode with a titanium mesh possessing a high area moment of inertia. The investigations reveal a synergistic interface stabilization mechanism: InSnBi undergoes adaptive creep to maintain ionic&#8208;electronic interpenetrating networks, while the titanium framework, through its flexural rigidity, redistributes localized stress and prevents heterogeneous stress concentrations from driving InSnBi creep toward the cathode. This hierarchical stress management mechanism ensures stable cycling by accommodating substantial volume fluctuations, thereby enabling ASSLBs to realize stable cycling at high loading (23.05 mAh cm&#8722;2) and low stack pressures (3&#160;MPa), respectively. Remarkably, the as&#8208;assembled LiCoO2||InSnBi full&#8208;cell with a capacity of 5.56 mAh cm&#8722;2 maintains a retention of 81.6% over 3000 cycles at a 2C rate. This work presents a new paradigm for addressing the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling degradation of ASSLBs, representing a milestone advancement for developing high&#8208;energy ASSLBs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficient Hot&#8208;Exciton Emission from Carbon Quantum Gear Rack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroluminescent LED fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission with good color purity, chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is aligned with the Rec. 2020 standard for the primary blue color.








Abstract
The quest for exemplary color purity, superior efficiency, and nontoxic deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence remains paramount for developing wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays. However, achieving a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y value below 0.05, an exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE), and a low&#8208;efficiency droop in deep&#8208;blue emitters presents a significant challenge. Here, the study reports a deep&#8208;blue emitting carbon quantum gear rack (DB&#8208;CQG) characterized by an emission wavelength of 406 nm and a high quantum yield of 80%. DB&#8208;CQG comprises nine benzene rings and four embedded nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods and exhibits a quasi&#8208;planar configuration that leads to hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state characteristics. Both experimental investigations and theoretical calculations revealed the activation of the reverse intersystem crossing channel between the high&#8208;lying triplet state and lowest excited singlet state in DB&#8208;CQG via hot&#8208;exciton mechanism. DB&#8208;CQG exhibits characteristic HLCT behavior with deep&#8208;blue emission owing to the partial overlap of holes and electrons, which is facilitated by the formation of nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods in the quasi&#8208;planar configuration. The electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibit a deep&#8208;blue color with chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is one of the highest reported efficiencies for solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue LEDs.

         <title>Spatial Control of Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Lithographic Applications in Liquid Crystal Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a strategy to spatially control supramolecular chirality by leveraging spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal materials. It is generated by periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains, stabilized by a polymer network. This approach enables precise defect engineering, tunable chirality, and functional applications in lithographic particle manipulation and reconfigurable microstructured surfaces.








Abstract
Precise spatial organization of enantiomeric domains within self&#8208;assembled materials remains a challenge despite advances in controlling supramolecular chirality. Here, it is presented a facile strategy for directing supramolecular chirality through spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal (LC) materials, generating periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains. An LC polymer network stabilizes zigzag line defects, preserving their spatial organization and mechanical integrity. Focused circular dichroism spectroscopy and computational simulations confirm the controlled enantiomeric distribution. It explores interfacial chiral interactions and shows how boundary regions between enantiomeric domains can manipulate microparticle position. Additionally, it is shown that kink density and orientation of the zigzag structure can be modulated by adjusting sample thickness, applied voltage, and electrode configurations, resulting in tunable periodicity and macroscopic direction. The findings provide a robust approach for fabricating chiral domains through soft&#8208;material&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a strategy to spatially control supramolecular chirality by leveraging spontaneous twist self-assembly in liquid crystal materials. It is generated by periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains, stabilized by a polymer network. This approach enables precise defect engineering, tunable chirality, and functional applications in lithographic particle manipulation and reconfigurable microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Invoking Hybrid&#8208;Ion Correlation Electrochemistry to Enable Optimal Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach that combines phase&#8208;field simulations and thermodynamic calculations is proposed, capturing ionic correlations in electrolytes/electrodes to activate the ionic electrodeposition (left) and (de)intercalation (right) performances in a hybrid&#8208;ion battery. This offers a potent approach to exceed the energy density and cycle life benchmarks set by single&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
As a generation beyond conventional batteries based on mono&#8208;/poly&#8208;valent ions, hybrid&#8208;ion batteries (HIBs) offer more opportunities to build battery prototypes because they utilize the merits of multiple ions. However, the limited understanding of ionic correlations in these heterogeneous systems experimentally and theoretically brings a great challenge in exploring their performance limits. Here, an approach is proposed combining electrochemical phase&#8208;field simulation with thermodynamic calculation, where ionic correlation in the electrolyte and electrode is addressed using the linearized Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann equation embedded with Debye&#8208;H&#252;ckel theory and ion&#8208;occupied sub&#8208;lattice model, to invoke the ionic electrodeposition and (de)intercalation advantages. This approach is independent of specific HIB electrolytes or electrodes. A &#8220;Seesaw&#8208;Inhibition&#8221; mechanism is uncovered, operating under hybrid&#8208;ion concentration regulation to determine the electrodeposition morphology in three types of HIBs, and simultaneously predict a general ion competitive behavior during their intercalation. Following this, a prototype of Na3V2(PO4)3||1&#160;M NaTfO+1&#160;M Zn(TfO)2||Zn aqueous HIB is built, surpassing pure Zn&#8208;ion batteries by 32% in measured energy density (128.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exhibiting low capacity decay (0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles). The scalability of the approach for regulating hybrid&#8208;ion electrochemistry demonstrates its practical viability for designing HIBs.

         <title>Trace Dual&#8208;Crosslinkable Additives Enable Direct Microlithography for Enhanced Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning is crucial for advancing organic electronics, enabling miniaturization and high&#8208;density integration. A dual crosslinking strategy is developed using a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) in polybenzodifurandione (PBFDO). At trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%), PR enhances patterning precision (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) and electrical performance, yielding a 42% &#181;C* increase and improved device stability, offering scalable solutions for organic electronics.








Abstract
Similar to silicon&#8208;based electronics, the implementation of micro/nano&#8208;patterning to facilitate complex device architectures and high&#8208;density integration is crucial to the development of organic electronics. Among various patterning techniques, direct microlithography (DML) is highly applicable and extensively adopted in organic electronics, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, conventional DML often requires high crosslinker concentrations, leading to compromised electrical performance. To address this challenge, a novel strategy is developed that combines supramolecular and covalent interactions by incorporating a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) into poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO). The PR forms a hydrogen bonding network with PBFDO and undergoes UV&#8208;triggered covalent crosslinking among its molecules, providing solvent resistance even at trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%). This approach enables precise patterning of PBFDO with feature sizes below 1&#160;&#181;m while preserving high electrical performance. Notably, PR also serves as a performance enhancer, promoting molecular ordering and ionic conduction within PBFDO. OECTs fabricated with PR&#8208;crosslinked PBFDO exhibit about one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in ON/OFF ratio, a 42% increase in &#181;C* (reaching 2460&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), and elevated operational stability compared to pristine ones. This multifunctional crosslinker offers a scalable solution for high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;density organic electronics and opens new avenues for supramolecular chemistry applications in this field.

         <title>Standalone Integrated Magnonic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standalone (not requiring external bias magnetic field) and tunable magnonic device is reported with all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on silicon (total footprint of 100 &#215; 150&#160;&#181;m) and 3&#8211;8&#160;GHz frequency band. This is achieved by monolithic integration of a CoFeB conduit with RF antennas and an assembly of NiFe and SmCo micromagnets providing a tunable bias field.








Abstract
In the race toward &#8220;beyond 6G&#8221; telecommunication platforms, magnonics emerges as a promising solution. To date, however, the requirement for bulky external sources of the magnetic bias field necessary for spin wave propagation has constituted a significant bottleneck, impeding the integration of magnonic devices into RF systems. Here, the first demonstration is presented of a standalone and tunable magnonic device featuring all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on a silicon substrate, with a compact footprint of 100 &#215; 150 &#181;m2. The device consists of a CoFeB waveguide equipped with two radio frequency antennas, flanked by a symmetric configuration of magnetic flux concentrators and SmCo permanent micromagnets. By varying the distance D between the flux concentrators and the permanent magnets from 0 to 12&#160;&#181;m, the transverse bias field can be tuned from 20.5 to 11 mT, respectively. This variation directly modulates the dispersion relation of Damon&#8208;Eshbach spin wave modes in the CoFeB waveguide. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices, the spin wave frequency band ranges from 3 to 8&#160;GHz, with precise tuning of the phase shift up to 120&#160;deg at 6&#160;GHz. The operational frequency band can be easily pushed to higher frequencies through micromagnet engineering.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Layer&#8208;Based Iontronic Pressure Sensor Coupling Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Wide&#8208;Range Detection for Temperature/Pressure Dual&#8208;Mode Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS) is developed using silkworm cocoon ion gel and PU foam, enabling stepwise EDL formation and enhanced ion migration. This versatile strategy synergizes high/low&#8208;permittivity layers with porous architecture, adaptable to diverse material systems, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity and wide&#8208;range sensing. Coupled with machine learning, DLIPS realizes temperature/pressure dual&#8208;mode sensing and silent speech recognition.








Abstract
Iontronic pressure sensors are widely used in human motion monitoring and human&#8211;machine interactions owing to their high sensitivity, wide measurement range, and excellent resolution. However, conventional dielectric layer designs often involve complex fabrication processes, high costs, and limited performances. This paper proposes a novel sensor structure, the dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS), which integrates high&#8208; and low&#8208;permittivity layers. Validated using silkworm cocoon ion gel and open&#8208;cell polyurethane foam as dielectrics, the DLIPS exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (72548.7 kPa&#8722;1), a wide working pressure range (0.001&#8211;420 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit (0.832 Pa), and remarkable durability exceeding 5000 cycles. By leveraging the distinct responses of the capacitance and resistance to pressure and temperature, the sensor can simultaneously measure both parameters. A deep learning regression model is integrated to decouple the mixed temperature and pressure signals, enabling accurate identification. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity and capability to detect minute pressure fluctuations, the DLIPS exhibited strong potential for skin&#8208;mounted silent speech recognition systems, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 98.5%.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-dielectric-layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS) is developed using silkworm cocoon ion gel and PU foam, enabling stepwise EDL formation and enhanced ion migration. This versatile strategy synergizes high/low-permittivity layers with porous architecture, adaptable to diverse material systems, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity and wide-range sensing. Coupled with machine learning, DLIPS realizes temperature/pressure dual-mode sensing and silent speech recognition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iontronic pressure sensors are widely used in human motion monitoring and human&#8211;machine interactions owing to their high sensitivity, wide measurement range, and excellent resolution. However, conventional dielectric layer designs often involve complex fabrication processes, high costs, and limited performances. This paper proposes a novel sensor structure, the dual-dielectric-layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS), which integrates high- and low-permittivity layers. Validated using silkworm cocoon ion gel and open-cell polyurethane foam as dielectrics, the DLIPS exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (72548.7 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), a wide working pressure range (0.001&#8211;420 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit (0.832 Pa), and remarkable durability exceeding 5000 cycles. By leveraging the distinct responses of the capacitance and resistance to pressure and temperature, the sensor can simultaneously measure both parameters. A deep learning regression model is integrated to decouple the mixed temperature and pressure signals, enabling accurate identification. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity and capability to detect minute pressure fluctuations, the DLIPS exhibited strong potential for skin-mounted silent speech recognition systems, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 98.5%. Furthermore, the DLIPS provides a cost-effective and scalable approach for fabricating ultrahigh-sensitivity pressure sensors, underscoring its versatility in wearable technology applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen Ion&#8208;Mediated Hydrothermal Synthesis of Diverse MXenes with Tailored Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen ion&#8208;mediated strategy is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures. NH4F etchant enables potential high&#8208;throughput synthesis of Mo2CTx, while NH4X &#8208;intercalant (X = Cl, Br, I) combinations facilitate large&#8208;scale production of hetero&#8208;Mo2CTx. This moderate hydrothermal strategy achieves precise structural control on a variety of MXenes and hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional physicochemical properties. Despite extensive studies, efficient methods for the production of MXenes with precise structural control still remain a challenge, thus hindering their potential in many specific applications. Herein, a halogen ion&#8208;mediated hydrothermal approach is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures, demonstrating its potential as a high&#8208;throughput synthesis strategy. As proof of concept, Mo2C can be synthesized on a gram scale by employing NH&#8324;F in the hydrothermal etching process of Mo2Ga2C. Subsequently, this approach is applied to various MXenes, including Ti3C2, V2C, and Nb4C3. Moreover, NH4X (X = Cl, Br, I) etchants combined with small&#8208;molecule intercalants enabled the targeted synthesis of MXene&#8208;based heterostructures, such as Mo2CTx@MoS2 featuring &#8776;15&#160;nm amorphous MoS2 surface layers. Notable, the Mo2CTx(Br) heterostructure exhibited outstanding electrochemical stability, delivering a capacity of 465.5 mAh g&#8315;&#185; after 300 cycles at 1 A g&#8315;&#185;, and achieving high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% during lithium&#8208;ion battery cycling. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for the synthesis of MXene&#8208;based materials, thus paving the way for accelerating their potential in various fields.

         <title>Constructing Continuously&#8208;Distributed and Crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anode Through Binder Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An innovative, continuously crystalline NaF&#8208;rich SEI is engineered on hard carbon anodes through cost&#8208;effective binder manipulation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred LA133's functional groups synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF, and homogenous LA133 coverage guides continuous NaF growth. The optimized hard carbon anodes deliver excellent storage performances regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Constructing the continuously&#8208;distributed and crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI) is expected to greatly promote the sodium storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, such an impressive concept remains extremely intractable to achieve and lacks an efficiently cost&#8208;less strategy. Herein, the application of the commercially available LA133 binder is pioneered to engineer such a CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI. Through comparative analysis of representative binders with distinct functional groups, reveals the critical role of binder chemistry on SEI regulation. Specifically, the LA133 binder demonstrates a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism for CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI formation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred &#9472;CN bonds induce an anion&#8208;enriched interfacial solvation structure, and the &#9472;CONH/&#9472;CN groups catalytically cleave P&#9472;F bond dissociation in PF6&#8722;, synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF. Furthermore, robust hydrogen bonds between multiple polar groups in LA133 and HC surface create the spatially anion&#8208;confined microenvironments to guide orderly anion decomposition and facilitate continuous NaF growth into a mechanically integrated SEI. The optimized CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI endows HC anodes with exceptional sodium storage performance: an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (95.9%), remarkable reversible capacity (356.6 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling under extreme conditions (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides fundamental insights into binder&#8208;SEI correlations, establishing a novel paradigm for interfacial optimization in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Synchronous Phase Transformation for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DMI is selected to partially replace DMSO. A homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase can be stably formed at spin&#8208;coating stage, and the synchronous phase transformation from the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase occurs at the annealing stage. Thus, a low&#8208;defect and homogeneous halide&#8208;phase WBG perovskite film is obtained. As a result, the DMI&#8208;treated wide bandgap PSCs exhibits an improved PCE and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halogen wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite materials are employed in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their continuous tunability of bandgap. However, inhomogeneous halogen phases are often observed in bromine&#8208;rich perovskite films, which restricts the performance of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and TSCs. Here, homogeneous halogen&#8208;phase perovskite is proposed to form film by a synchronous halogen&#8208;phase transformation strategy. 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, due to its stronger binding energy with lead halide (PbX2). The homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase is stable in precursor solution and at spin&#8208;coating stage. And it then synchronously transforms into a homogeneous halide&#8208;phase perovskite film at the annealing stage. Benefited from efficient carrier extraction and suppressed carrier recombination, the resulting 1.76 eV&#8208;bandgap PSC achieves a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.42% (certified 21.18%) among devices with a bandgap wider than 1.74 eV. Based on the high transmittance of semitransparent&#8208;WBG PSC, a 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSC achieves a PCE of 29.66%.

         <title>Programmable Surface Dimpling of Textile Metamaterials for Aerodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance. Here, a stretched&#8208;induced auxetic dimpling textile that tunes surface roughness while tightly fitted is presented. Wind&#8208;tunnel tests and FE design mapping show controllable dimples can cut drag by up to 20% in target ranges, and real&#8208;time strain adjustments can sustain optimal performance of a cylindrical body








Abstract
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance under variable operating conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance. Here, a stretched-induced auxetic dimpling textile that tunes surface roughness while tightly fitted is presented. Wind-tunnel tests and FE design mapping show controllable dimples can cut drag by up to 20% in target ranges, and real-time strain adjustments can sustain optimal performance of a cylindrical body

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Antimony Chalcogenide Tandem Solar Cells via Thermal&#8208;Evaporated CdS Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing thermal evaporation to prepare high&#8208;quality CdS electron transport layers, this study achieves 7.46% PCE in a semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 device and 10.51% PCE in a 4T Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 tandem cell, surpassing the 10% efficiency limit for all antimony&#8208;based solar cells for the first time.








Abstract
Sb2S3, with an ideal bandgap of 1.7 eV, is a promising top&#8208;cell absorber for tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, CdS electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared via chemical bath deposition suffer from poor crystallinity and high roughness, inducing interfacial defects, parasitic absorption, and severe carrier recombination, which hinder device performance. To address these challenges, this study employs thermal evaporation (TE) to fabricate CdS ETLs for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. The TE&#8208;CdS films exhibit superior crystallinity, reduced roughness, and enhanced chemical purity. Sb2S3 films deposited on TE&#8208;CdS show preferential (hk1) orientation, improved crystallinity, optimized band alignment, and suppressed interfacial defects, facilitating efficient charge transport and light management. By incorporating a MoO3/ITO/Ag electrode, the semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46%, the highest reported efficiency for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. Furthermore, a four&#8208;terminal (4T) TSC, formed by mechanically stacking Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 cells, attains the champion PCE of 10.51% for all&#8208;antimony chalcogenide&#8208;based TSCs. This study provides critical insights into ETL engineering for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent Sb&#8208;based solar cells and their tandem integration.

         <title>Giant Circularly Polarized Luminescence Driven by Excited&#8208;State Hybridization Between Molecular Emitters and Chiral Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental chiroptical response amplification mechanism is revealed to massively enhance molecular helicene chiral emitters. The luminescent dissymmetry factor of the helicene emitter is amplified by 133 times through excited&#8208;state hybridization with a polymeric chiral environment. The amplification mechanism does not rely on a specific energy transfer process, therefore offering new paths for the design of chiral emissive systems.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) light is extensively used in various fields such as asymmetrical synthesis, sensing, and advanced displays. Consequently, significant efforts have been made to develop chiral materials that intrinsically emit CP light with a large dissymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). It is widely considered that the dissymmetry factor for individual organic emitters, due to the amplitude offset between their electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, is limited to &#8776;10&#8722;2, which is inadequate for practical applications. Recent efforts to enhance CP light emission have therefore focused on amplifying the dissymmetry of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), often via specific energy transfer processes. Here, a fundamental mechanism is discovered &#8211; excited&#8208;state hybridization, which amplifies CPL through excitonic coupling without relying on energy transfer processes. Through this wavefunction hybridization, both the amplitude and sign of the rotatory strength related to the molecular emitter's electronic transition are modified to align with its chiral environment, remarkably boosting the CP luminescence from an intrinsic dissymmetry factor of &#8722;10&#8722;3 up to +0.40. This breakthrough allows for more versatile design strategies for chiral emissive systems, moving beyond designs limited to energy transfer processes and paving the way for new approaches to achieve strong CP emissive materials.

         <title>Fundamental Limits on the Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Superconducting Tc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving room&#8208;temperature superconductivity is a major goal in condensed matter physics. This work shows that room&#8208;temperature superconductivity, at least when mediated by phonons, is possible only in hydrogen&#8208;rich compounds known as superhydrides. A central result is the identification of a fundamental upper limit to electron&#8208;phonon interactions beyond which a stable metallic state cannot be maintained.








Abstract
Fundamental upper bounds on the electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature Tc in metals are established based on the intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice under strong interaction. This instability explains why observed electron&#8208;phonon coupling constants are limited to &#955; &#8818; 4. The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced Tc, which emerges near the instability threshold. Based on theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental data, room&#8208;temperature phonon&#8208;mediated superconductivity is found to be feasible exclusively in hydrogen&#160;compounds.

         <title>Robust Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered Co(OH)2/Cu Heterostructures Boost Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia beyond 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy is proposed to engineer robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched Co(OH)2/Cu heterostructures, which boosts hydrogen supply and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting *NO2 to *NOOH step via oxygen vacancy incorporation, thereby enabling high&#8208;current&#8208;density, scalable, and practical NH3 electrosynthesis. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a sustainable paradigm for green NH3 synthesis and NO3&#8722; wastewater valorization. However, overcoming sluggish NO3RR kinetics under industrial&#8208;current operation persists as a critical challenge. Herein, robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched heterostructures (Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2/Cu) are engineered through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. By coupling Cu&#8208;mediated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion with Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;accelerated NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation, this heterostructured system delivers an unprecedented NH3 yield rate of 167.8 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and 97.7% Faradaic efficiency at &gt;2 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining exceptional current tolerance over 25 h. Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ov in Co(OH)2 synergistically accelerates water dissociation to ensure continuous hydrogen supply and optimizes *NOOH adsorption, reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting step (*NO2 to *NOOH). To demonstrate practical viability, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer integrating NO3RR with glycerol oxidation reaction achieves highly effective co&#8208;production of NH3 and formate alongside wastewater treatment. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for scalable and practical NO3RR applications.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; wastewater valorization. However, overcoming sluggish NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR kinetics under industrial-current operation persists as a critical challenge. Herein, robust oxygen vacancy-enriched heterostructures (O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu) are engineered through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. By coupling Cu-mediated NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conversion with O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-accelerated NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transformation, this heterostructured system delivers an unprecedented NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 167.8 mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 97.7% Faradaic efficiency at &amp;gt;2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining exceptional current tolerance over 25 h. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; in Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synergistically accelerates water dissociation to ensure continuous hydrogen supply and optimizes &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NOOH adsorption, reducing the energy barrier for the rate-limiting step (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NOOH). To demonstrate practical viability, a membrane-electrode-assembly electrolyzer integrating NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR with glycerol oxidation reaction achieves highly effective co-production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and formate alongside wastewater treatment. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction-induced vacancy engineering for scalable and practical NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single DNA molecules are captured within the hotspots of DNA origami NanoAntennas arranged on a chip surface. Fluorescence is amplified, enabling direct detection on a point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;compatible imaging setup (visualized as bright signals against a dark background).








Abstract
Creating increasingly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) applications. This requires highly specific capture of biomarkers and efficient transduction of capture events.&#160;However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence&#8208;based methods, necessitating molecular amplification. Here, we present single&#8208;molecule detection of a non&#8208;amplified,&#160;151&#8208;nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae down to attomolar concentrations, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). This NACHOS&#8208;diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field&#8208;of&#8208;view, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by NanoAntennas, arranged using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site&#8208;specific DNA origami placement. This method can detect 200&#160;&#177; 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100&#160;&#181;L sample volume within an hour. This represents a typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. This platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification&#8208;based technologies. This provides a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in diverse clinical settings.

         <title>Reengineering Endogenous Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (ENDO) for Systemic Delivery of mRNA to Pancreas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ENDO lipid nanoparticles containing cholecalciferol as a fifth component demonstrate mRNA delivery to the pancreas with 99% selectivity, including beta cells. This platform shows minimal toxicity and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, offering a novel approach to pancreas&#8208;specific mRNA delivery and gene therapy that is suitable for repeat administration with clinical relevance.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) hold transformative potential for nucleic acid delivery, with applications ranging from clinical use, particularly in COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, to gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. However, a major limitation lies in their preferential accumulation in the liver following intravenous administration, making most targets hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach. In this study, a novel platform called endogenous targeting lipid nanoparticles (ENDO), containing cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) as a fifth component is reported, that selectively delivers mRNA to the pancreas &#8211; a target previously inaccessible through intravenous administration. The top formulation, C&#8208;CholF3, demonstrates an unprecedented 99% pancreas selectivity with robust and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner with minimal toxicity that makes it suitable for repeat administration. This organ&#8208;specific delivery is proposed to be mediated by an endogenous targeting mechanism involving the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). C&#8208;CholF3 also enables selective pancreatic delivery of plasmid DNA and circular mRNA, underscoring its versatility and therapeutic potential. Furthermore, C&#8208;CholF3 exhibits pancreas&#8208;specific gene editing in the Ai14 transgenic mouse model, showing high expression of tdTomato in the &#946; cells. These findings highlight its potential for translational applications in protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene editing for currently incurable pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes.

         <title>Regulating Solvation Chemistries via Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Locally Concentrated Suspension Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal charged suspension electrolyte design strategy is proposed here, which tailors solvation structures and regulates deposition behaviors in Li metal batteries. Negatively charged additives, locally concentrated at the Li metal's surface under the internal electric field, alter the solvation chemistry by interacting with Li ions, resulting in fewer solvating solvent molecules and inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, are in great demand for powering modern society. Their energy density can further be significantly improved by using Li metal anodes; however, Li metal suffers from the critical challenges of unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) along with uncontrollable dendritic Li growth. Here, a universal electrolyte design principle is proposed and demonstrated by using suspension electrolytes with charged additives. The solvation structure of Li ions can be regulated, as negatively charged additives show strong electrostatic interaction with Li ions, leaving them weakly solvated in the electrolyte. Moreover, negatively charged additives carrying Li ions can be locally concentrated at the surface of the Li metal, enhancing their ability to regulate solvation and improve interfacial mobility, beneficial for the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs and compact Li deposition. Accordingly, Li||Li symmetric cell demonstrates &gt;500&#160;h stable cycling at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, and Li||LiFePO4 cell shows 97% capacity retention after 400 cycles in 1C. The universality of this design is further demonstrated in various negatively charged suspension electrolyte systems. Such an electrolyte design rationale can shed light on the development of advanced electrolyte systems for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;duration metal battery systems.

         <title>Tailoring COFs with Water and Oxygen Pathways for Efficient Catalyst Interfaces in PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation and side&#8208;chain engineering created independent water&#8208;oxygen channels in COFs to boost mass transport. Using P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as a binder optimized these channels, greatly enhancing the Pt/C catalyst performance. This resulted in a marked increase in PEMFC peak power density, even with reduced platinum loading, highlighting the role of COFs in improving both catalyst efficiency and transport kinetics.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency and clean emissions. However, reducing platinum (Pt) loadings in PEMFCs remains challenging due to the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. This study investigates phosphorylated covalent organic frameworks (P&#8208;rCOFs) as ionomers in PEMFCs, aiming to optimize the three&#8208;phase interface at the catalyst surface. Through the protonation of tertiary amine sites and precise structural engineering of side chains within the COF framework, well&#8208;defined transport channels are created to enhance water and oxygen mass transfer. The results demonstrate that P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 significantly improves the catalytic performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential 37&#160;mV higher than Nafion. Furthermore, a PEMFC incorporating P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as an ionomer binder achieves a peak power density of 2.40&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 catalyst loading, a 1.5 fold increase over Nafion. This work underscores the potential of P&#8208;rCOFs in optimizing the three&#8208;phase interface, offering a promising pathway for more efficient and cost&#8208;effective PEMFCs.

Furthermore, a PEMFC incorporating P-rCOF-C4 as an ionomer binder achieves a peak power density of 2.40&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst loading, a 1.5 fold increase over Nafion. This work underscores the potential of P-rCOFs in optimizing the three-phase interface, offering a promising pathway for more efficient and cost-effective PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Power and Robust Bi2SeO5 Films Optoelectronic Memristors for Bio&#8208;Visual Perception Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a low&#8208;power, fast&#8208;response Bi&#8322;SeO&#8325; thin&#8208;film&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor with robust performance. Leveraging its dual&#8208;mode operation (photodetector/synaptic device at different wavelengths), a bio&#8208;inspired visual perception/computation system is developed, achieving &gt;160 kbit&#160;s&#8722;1 optical communication and hardware&#8208;based optical reservoir computing, offering an ultrafast, energy&#8208;efficient approach for enhanced bionic vision systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors have broad application prospects in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IOT) because they can dynamically process a large number of spatiotemporal optoelectronic signals in complex environments. However, it is still a challenge to develop optoelectronic memristors with low power consumption and fast response while maintaining the efficiency and robustness of the system. Here, a photoelectric memristor based on Bi2SeO5 thin film is proposed. This device has an ultra&#8208;fast resistance switching speed (&#8776;9.5&#160;ns) and ultra&#8208;low synaptic event power consumption (&#8776;1.36 fJ). The stable instantaneous light on/off response behavior within 4000 cycles and the very fast photoresponse speed (&#8776;28&#160;ns) also confirm the excellent applicability of the device as a photodetector. More importantly, a bionic visual perception and computing system is designed. The system not only uses devices as photodetectors to achieve wireless communication with a speed of more than 160&#160;kb s&#8722;1, but also uses the synaptic effect of devices under bias voltage to realize the optical reservoir computing (RC) network at the hardware level. The accuracy rate of digital recognition is 90.5%, which provides an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;power method for developing widely used and performance enhanced bionic visual systems.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitation&#8208;Modulated Multi&#8208;Color Three&#8208;photon Excited Luminescence in Ln&#8208;MOF Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy toward realizing multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework heterostructure has been developed through a novel hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping method. The as&#8208;obtained heterostructure with wide MPEL color gamut and great up&#8208;conversion luminescent anisotropy is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation is of great application value for optoelectronics, especially MPEL with the characteristics of multi&#8208;color emission and optical anisotropy. However, it still suffers from the obstacles in highly&#8208;integrating and orientedly&#8208;assembly of various MPEL units. Herein, a hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping strategy is proposed to establish a novel lanthanide&#8208;graded metal&#8208;organic framework based heterostructure. Well&#8208;designed ligand and Ln3+ ions are respectively selected as the MPEL energy donor and acceptor units (MEDU and MEAU). Through utilizing the effective energy transfer between them, the as&#8208;obtained triblock heterostructure displays multi&#8208;dimensional three&#8208;photon excited luminescence (3PEL) modulation, where the emission band and intensity can be switched by manipulating excited regions and excitation polarization based on a single pump source. This is attributed to the precise integration and orientation of photonic units. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits multi&#8208;color 3PEL with a record&#8208;high MPEL color gamut (&gt;30% of sRGB area) in MOFs and high degree of linear polarization values (max &#8776;88.6%). Such anisotropic 3PEL modulation shows promising potential in nonlinear optical switches, programmable logic gates, and multi&#8208;level optical barcodes. These findings open up an intriguing way to develop up&#8208;conversion luminescent materials with functions on demand toward photonic modulation.

         <title>Modulating Dynamic Deprotonation Evolution via Sacrificial Solvation Structure to Mitigate Zinc Electrochemical Corrosion and Cathodic Structure Deterioration for High&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mitigate proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte with distinctive sacrificial solvation structure is developed to suppressing zinc chemical self&#8208;discharge corrosion and electrochemical corrosion for high&#8208;stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium batteries.








Abstract
Compared to the free water molecules induced chemical corrosion, the electrochemical corrosion arising from the structured water elicits more pronounced zinc anode degradation, result in the limited cycle lifespan, especially at low current densities. However, the interfacial degradation mechanism remains inadequately resolved. Herein, for the inhibition of proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte is developed through the chelation of carboxymethyl chitosan (CCS) with Zn2+ ions. In accordance with Fajans' rules, CCS with highly polar carboxylate and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing amino groups exhibits enhanced ionic polarizability, which forms distinctive solvation structures with reduced deprotonation energy. Such solvation structures demonstrate competitive advantages in interfacial deprotonation dynamics and minimize proton release to suppress electrochemical corrosion via sacrificial protection. Furthermore, the crosslinked framework induced by molecular crowding restricts free water mobility, thereby alleviating zinc chemical corrosion and cathodic structure deterioration. By employing advanced MRI technology, the movement trajectories of water molecules and the dynamic deprotonation evolution process are directly visualized. Therefore, the cyclically rested Zn symmetric cell impressively operates 4000&#160;h at low current density of 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn||NH4VO full cell exhibits 81% capacity retention after cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, while the aqueous electrolyte only maintains 31%.

         <title>Element&#8208;Engineered Lithium Borate for High&#8208;Efficiency Prelithiation in Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), is proposed and synthesized based on the non&#8208;metallic element boron (B), which is ultralight, inexpensive, and free of d&#8208;orbitals. LBO exhibits an excellent initial charge specific capacity of 692 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, combined with cost&#8208;effectiveness, outstanding air stability, and strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy density&#160;of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remains a critical challenge for advancing next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. Silicon&#8208;based anodes offer significantly higher theoretical capacitites, but their practical application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), leading to substantial lithium loss and rapid full cell performance degradation. Herein, a novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), based on the ultralight, cost&#8208;effective, and d&#8208;orbital&#8208;free non&#8208;metallic element boron (B) is presented. LBO features a core&#8211;shell architecture, consisting of a crystalline Li3BO3 core encapsulated by Li2CO3 and amorphous carbon, delivering an exceptional initial charge capacity of 692 mAh g&#8722;1 and superior atmospheric stability with 70% capacity retention after 8 days of ambient exposure. When applied in SiOx||LRLO (Li&#8208;rich layered oxide) pouch cells, LBO enhances the gravimetric and volumetric energy density by 14.7% and 21.8%, respectively, while effectively suppressing the irreversible LRLO degradation caused by Li deficiency. This work introduces an element&#8208;centric design methodology for prelithiation agents, providing a promising route to propel the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois Resonators with Tellurium for Battery Thermal Runaway Warning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator with a thin tellurium layer enables rapid, reversible, and untethered detection of battery surface temperature &lt;80 &#176;C. Exploiting tellurium's refractive index change driven by a thermally induced phase transition between solid and quasi&#8208;liquid states, the GT resonator visualizes heat propagation, providing an effective early warning system against battery thermal runaway.








Abstract
Effective temperature monitoring is crucial for preventing battery fires caused by thermal runaway, ensuring human safety, and providing timely warnings. While thermochromic materials offer intuitive, real&#8208;time temperature visualization, their slow response times remain them unsuitable for battery monitoring. A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator specifically designed for rapid and accurate battery temperature detection in the critical range below 80 &#176;C is introduced, where thermal runaway risks can be effectively mitigated. Central to this design is an ultrathin (10&#160;nm) thermo&#8208;responsive tellurium film, paired with a protective glass layer and an underlying metallic mirror. This thermochromic GT resonator exhibits reversible temperature detection over multiple cycles, actively responding to temperature changes through partial melting of tellurium, which alters its complex refractive index&#8212;a property discovered in the 1960s but now harnessed for this novel application. Notably, the resonator monitors both specific temperature points and overall heat transfer across the battery surface, achieving sub&#8208;second response times in an untethered manner. These findings position the thermochromic GT resonator as a promising platform for direct, intuitive, and compact temperature monitoring in energy storage systems.

         <title>Exploring Anionic Redox Chemistry of Battery Cathodes with Resonant Inelastic X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering is a crucial technique for energy storage and energy sustainability due to its superior resolution and uniqueness for studying the anionic redox in cathode materials. This Perspective presents the powerful edges of RIXS as well as its promising capabilities such as imaging and in situ options that further advance the development of battery research.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity and reversible cathodes are important for sustainable energy development. Layered oxides present promising options, achieving a high capacity while maintaining manageable production costs. Despite the redox activity of transition metal primarily contributes to the capacity, anionic redox offers additional potential, as evidenced by the subtle voltage plateau at high voltage. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the reversibility of anionic redox, resulting in voltage fade, hysteresis, and the formation of undesired oxygen species. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (RIXS) captures not only the charge transfer processes between oxygen ligands and transition metals but also the formation of molecular oxygen, elucidating the chemical transformations of oxygen during electrochemical cycles. Mapping capability allows for the generation of spectral patterns with quantitative measures that surpass those achievable by other characterization techniques. Though early reports on its advantages, a comprehensive discussion of RIXS and its perspectives on anionic redox processes in cathode materials remains absent but necessary. This perspective aims to provide a systematic overview of RIXS, emphasizing its unique contributions to cathode material research. It also serves as a valuable reference for energy researchers and RIXS practitioners, featuring the advancements and future possibilities of this powerful technique.

         <title>Coexisting Multiple Charge Orders and Magnetism in the Kagome Superconductor LaRu3Si2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of two distinct charge orders and emergent magnetism is uncovered in the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2. A low&#8208;temperature (1/6,0,0) charge order below 80 K induces magnetoresistance, and field&#8208;driven magnetic response. An additional lower&#8208;temperature scale marks time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking and Hall sign reversal, highlighting LaRu3Si2's unique interplay of charge order with pronounced electronic responses, magnetism, and superconductivity. The calculations underscore the relevance of electronic correlations in this system.








Abstract
The Kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for hosting unconventional chiral charge orders at high temperatures. In the context of the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2, a room&#8208;temperature charge&#8208;ordered state with a propagation vector of (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) is previously reported. However, understanding the interplay between this charge order and superconductivity, particularly with respect to time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking, remains elusive. In this study, we employ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetotransport measurements, muon&#8208;spin rotation experiments, and first&#8208;principles calculations to investigate charge order and its electronic and magnetic responses in LaRu3Si2 across a wide temperature range, down to the superconducting state. These findings reveal the appearance of a charge order with a propagation vector of (16$\frac{1}{6}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K, which coexists with the previously identified room temperature primary charge order (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0). The primary charge&#8208;ordered state exhibits zero magnetoresistance. In contrast, the appearance of the secondary charge order at Tco, 2 is accompanied by a notable magnetoresistance response and a pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent Hall effect, which experiences a sign reversal, switching from positive to negative below T* &#8771; 35 K. Intriguingly, a significant enhancement is observed in the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble below T* &#8771; 35 K. Moreover, the muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a substantial increase upon the application of an external magnetic field below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K. These results highlight the coexistence of two distinct types of charge order and magnetism in LaRu3Si2 within the correlated Kagome lattice, along with superconductivity. This study sheds light on the intricate electronic and magnetic phenomena occurring in Kagome superconductors, providing valuable insights into their unique properties and potential&#160;applications.

         <title>Unlocking NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence in 2D Copper Tetrasilicate Nanosheets through Flame Spray Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis method is presented to synthesize ultra&#8208;bright CTS nanosheets with tunable NIR&#8208;II emission. Achieving quantum yields up to 34%, these materials support high&#8208;speed imaging and enable super&#8208;resolution in vivo applications such as transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking.









Abstract
Expanding fluorescence bioimaging into the second near&#8208;infrared spectrum (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) unlocks advanced possibilities for diagnostics and therapeutics, offering superior tissue penetration and resolution. 2D copper tetrasilicate (CTS) pigments (MCuSi4O10, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) are known for their brightness and stability, yet synthetic challenges have curbed their integration into bioimaging. Here, flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis (FSP) is introduced as a versatile and scalable synthesis approach to produce ultra&#8208;bright, metastable CTS nanosheets (NS) by annealing multi&#8208;element metal oxide nanoparticles into 2D crystals through calcination or laser irradiation. Group&#8208;II ion incorporation shifts emission into the NIR&#8208;II range, with Ba0.33Sr0.33Ca0.33CuSi4O10 peaking at 1007&#160;nm, while minor Mg&#8208;doping induces a hypsochromic shift and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The engineered CTS achieves quantum yields of up to 34%, supporting NS high&#8208;frame&#8208;rate imaging (&gt; 200 fps). These unique properties enable CTS&#8208;NS to serve as powerful contrast agents for super&#8208;resolution NIR bioimaging, demonstrated in vivo through transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking in mice using diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). This pioneering synthesis strategy unlocks wavelength&#8208;tunable NS for advanced NIR&#8208;II bioimaging applications.

         <title>Amorphizing Iron Molybdate as a High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Multiple Insertion Reactions in the Metastable Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphizing iron molybdate (a&#8208;FMO) with its transition mechanism and electrochemical performance are elaborately revealed. Unlocking both the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in metastable structure, a&#8208;FMO endows a high&#8208;capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1cathode (231.6 mAh g&#8722;1cathode+anode in the full&#8208;cell) at room temperature and the superior cycling resilience at low temperature (&#8722;30 &#176;C).








Abstract
The rising energy demand for electric vehicles and energy storage has revived interest in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, present LMBs still mainly rely on conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2) with limited reversible capacity (&#8776;150 to &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1cathode), necessitating the paradigm to achieve a new host with abundant Li+ accommodation sites. Herein, it is proposed a high&#8208;capacity amorphizing iron molybdate cathode a&#8208;Fe2(MoO4)3 (a&#8208;FMO), which can reversibly unlock Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in the metastable structure. Different from its parent crystal and stoichiometric oxides mixtures, a&#8208;FMO, with its inherent metastable structure, can not only augment the lithium storage capacities with fully activated redox centers, but also attenuate the lattice confinements for Li+ ion migration. Consequently, the in&#8208;situ generated a&#8208;FMO electrode exhibited a notable reversible capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 500 cycles. It endowed a specific energy density of 597 Wh kg&#8722;1 and all&#8208;climate adaptability over 60 to &#8208;40 &#176;C benefited from the amorphizing nature, as well as negligible capacity degradation when cycling at &#8208;30 &#176;C. The identification of local structure evolutions and multiple&#8208;redox activations in amorphizing materials broadens the scope for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2501565, Xu Chen, Yihang Pan, Tianxin Lin, and co&#8208;workers have established a platform utilizing a CRISPR system&#8208;based bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) for the efficient and cost&#8208;effective targeted delivery of plasmids. The intravesical administration of these engineered OMVs, which encoding CXCL&#8208;9 and IL&#8208;12, have been shown to effectively facilitating T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation. This process enhances the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of OMV&#8208;mediated therapies and increases sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 treatments. Consequently, this approach presents a novel strategy to address resistance to immunotherapy in the context of bladder cancer.

Covalent Adaptable Networks
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds enables both heat&#8208; and light&#8208;driven bond exchange. When combined with magnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature facilitates contactless, reversible, and spatiotemporally controlled 3D shape reconfiguration and fixation during magnetomechanical actuation. More details can be found in article number 2503161 by Sohdam Jeong, Jeong Jae Wie, Chae Bin Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Design Strategies and Advancements in Organic Spintronics: from Material Engineering and Interfacial Modification to Functional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies and advancements in organic spintronics are comprehensively discussed in this review. In the research of active layer materials, spinterface, ferromagnetic electrode preparation, and functional devices, numerous design strategies are devised to optimize their spin&#8208;related performance and propel this field toward practical applications in the near future.








Abstract
Organic spintronics, which has emerged as a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, has recently attracted much research enthusiasm from both the scientific community and industry. As a category of materials typically composed of light elements, organic materials inherently possess weaker spin&#8210;orbit coupling and hyperfine interactions, which are considered beneficial for spin transport. Numerous organic materials have been meticulously synthesized to reveal their structure&#8210;performance relationships. The spinterface effect induced by the ferromagnetic metal/organic material interface has led to novel physical mechanisms. The development of functional devices has promoted this field toward practical applications. Herein, design strategies and advancements in this field are presented, focusing on active material design, interfacial modification, and functional devices. First, the review discusses the influence of the active layer design on spin&#8208;related properties, including the chemical structures of small molecules, polymers, their multicomponent regulation strategies, and chiral materials. Subsequently, the review enumerates reliable ferromagnetic electrode preparation methods and spinterface modification methods aimed at adjusting the spin injection and transport efficiency. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of the strategies for enhancing the performance of functional devices in this field is presented. Finally, a concise summary and prospective outlook are proposed, highlighting the necessity and potential for future advancements in organic spintronics.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Neuromorphic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crossover of additive Manufacturing (AM) and neuromorphic engineering promises a new paradigm in the fabrication of intelligent hardware&#8212;one that is sustainable, scalable, cost&#8208;efficient, and customizable. The AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) is examined, and we discussed the technological integration. Upon overcoming process incompatibility and limited resolution issues of AM, 3D&#8208;printed neuromorphic systems may revolutionize intelligent electronics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering aims to create brain&#8208;inspired computing systems based on synaptic electronic hardware and neural network software. It combines intelligent materials, advanced processing technology, and computation programs. Additive manufacturing (AM), despite being one of the advanced manufacturing technologies capable of multimaterial processing at the microscale, is not widely applied in neuromorphic hardware fabrication. This gap suggests not only process incompatibility and limited resolution of AM but opportunities to create novel intelligent systems. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (synaptic electronics and mechanical systems) is reviewed and discussed the integration of AM techniques with neuromorphic engineering. An outlook of printed neuromorphic systems is provided with low cost and environmental impact but high customizability and design flexibility. With ongoing innovation in AM technologies and materials, AM is envisioned with high throughput and resolution for affordable, scalable, and customizable neuromorphic hardware production. The crossover of AM and neuromorphic engineering facilitates prototyping of brain&#8208;inspired computing architectures for efficient and analog computation. This approach may facilitate various applications including neuromorphic robotics, bionics, and real&#8208;time sensing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer a novel platform for thermoelectric energy conversion through unique band features, including band inversion, linear Dirac bands, surface states, and Berry curvature. These quantum characteristics enable enhanced longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects, establishing topological thermoelectrics as a promising frontier for both fundamental research and advanced energy technologies.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect, which enables the direct conversion of heat into electricity or vice versa, has great importance for condensed matter physics and material science due to its great potential for sustainable energy applications. Topological materials, with their topologically nontrivial band structures and rich physical phenomena, offer exciting opportunities for achieving efficient TE energy conversion. Here, an overview of the recent theoretical is provided and experimental advances at the intersection of topology and thermoelectricity. The unique features of topological materials are examined, such as band inversion, topological surface/edge states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and Berry curvature, affect their TE transport properties. Additionally, the potential of band topology to enhance both longitudinal and transverse TE performance is discussed. The current challenges and prospects for further advancing topological TE materials and devices are identified, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance TE materials and devices.

         <title>Ordering Engineering among the Nanostructure Evolution Facilitates High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition. Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address these issues, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of SEI, managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition. Herein, recent advances in ordering engineering which effectively promote the interface ordering are systematically summarized. The importance of constructing a multilayer SEI with oriented inorganic components and achieving strong Li texture with preferred crystal plane is highlighted. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques employed in ordering engineering are critically reviewed. Finally, the comprehensive examination of challenges encountered in ordering engineering is presented and promising research pathways for future investigation are highlighted. This review aims to encourage discussion and research on the ordering engineering in LMBs, with the goal of enhancing cycle life and safety to accelerate their practical applications.

         <title>Designing the Next Generation of Biomaterials through Nanoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineering enables precise control over biomaterial interactions with living systems by tuning surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity. This review highlights how these nanoscale design parameters drive advances in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, bioprinting, biosensing, and bioimaging, while outlining key translational challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Recent advances in biomaterials science have applied nanoengineering to develop biomaterials with superior properties and tailored functionalities. These unique attributes are achieved due to the ability of nanoengineering to provide precise control over material interactions with living systems at the molecular scale. Here, key nanotechnologies employed to develop the next generation of biomaterials are critically evaluated. A diverse range of nanomaterials, differing in base materials, shapes, sizes, or surface properties can be integrated into various fabrication processes to develop these advanced biomaterials. Further investigation is required into properties such as surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity, as these critically influence the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of nanoengineered materials. Consequently, we explore diverse biomedical applications of nanoengineered biomaterials, including regenerative medicine, biomolecular delivery, additive manufacturing, immune engineering, cancer therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensing, antimicrobial devices, and tissue adhesives. Additionally, their current limitations are analyzed and emerging strategies for designing the next generation of nanoengineered biomaterials are highlighted.

         <title>Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments at the Interface of Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) and their pivotal role in solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) development. It examines various ISE categories, interface characteristics, and commercialization challenges while highlighting advanced characterization techniques and the transformative impact of machine learning in enhancing ISE performance and addressing existing technological barriers.








Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) are critical components of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), and their interfacial properties play a decisive role in battery performance. This paper systematically reviews the recent advances in the interfaces of ISEs. It begins by defining and classifying ISEs&#8212;encompassing oxides, sulfides, and halides&#8212;while highlighting their fundamental characteristics, potential applications, and existing interface challenges. The discussion extends to the composition, structure, and reaction phenomena at the interfaces of SSBs, focusing on how these factors influence internal resistance, cycling stability, and safety. We detail advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed to investigate interfacial microstructures and chemical properties, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance for electrical and structural analysis, while also highlighting emerging modalities for interface characterization in SSBs. Additionally, we explore the role of informatics strategies, particularly high&#8208;throughput computing and machine learning, in predicting interfacial stability, calculating ionic transport properties, and screening new materials to optimize interface engineering. Despite noteworthy progress in understanding ISE interfaces, challenges remain that hinder the commercialization of SSBs. Future research efforts should prioritize the optimization of interfacial structures and properties through multi&#8208;scale and multi&#8208;technique approaches to further accelerate SSB development.

         <title>Strategies for Continuous Responsive Motion in a Constant Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to achieving continuous responsive motion lies in a negative feedback loop between the stimuli received by the responsive material and its own motion behavior. Therefore, this review summarizes four strategies for constructing feedback loops in responsive motion systems, including B&#8208;Z reaction strategy, self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, gradient stimulus field strategy, and complex device&#8208;based strategy.








Abstract
Continuous responsive motion gains significant attention due to its widespread applications in autonomous braking systems, low&#8208;power generation, human&#8208;computer interaction, and other fields. Continuous responsive motion in a constant environment is particularly important because it enables self&#8208;sustained actuation in unmanned settings. In this review, four strategies are summarized for continuous responsive motion in a constant environment and elaborate on the mechanisms, including the Belousov&#8208;Zhabotinsky reaction strategy, the self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, the gradient stimulus field strategy, and the complex device&#8208;based strategy. This study first provides a brief overview of the development history of continuous responsive motion systems in a constant environment. Then, the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application scopes of the four strategies are illustrated. Afterward, the applications of these continuous responsive motion systems are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are presented for the field of continuous responsive motion in a constant environment, offering inspiration for the development of new continuous responsive motion systems.

Abstract

Solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation is a green and energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology with diverse applications in desalination, steam power generation, and agricultural irrigation. Biomass materials have gained significant attention in solar evaporator engineering due to their unique structure, low cost, and ease of adjustment. With enhanced light absorption and high thermal conductivity, biomass materials can improve evaporation efficiency substantially, thus providing opportunities in solar evaporation applications. Therefore, in this critical review, the operating principles and design concepts of solar evaporators are first briefly discussed in terms of the photothermal conversion mechanism. Subsequently, the superiority of biomass materials in solar evaporator design is described in detail from the types of biomass and their structural properties at micro/macro scales. The design principles and corresponding performance enhancement strategies for biomass&#8208;based evaporators are also highlighted, including material selection, structural design, and thermal management techniques. Meanwhile, recent advances in biomass&#8208;based evaporators for several cutting&#8208;edge applications are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide a comprehensive reference for the relevant researchers to advance the research and application of biomass&#8208;based solar evaporators and to promote their wide application in the field of green technology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Nanocellulose Composites for Multifunctional Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocellulose composites have significant potential for the multi&#8208;functional remediation of the environment. This review focused on the synthesis strategies (in situ growth, ex situ growth, and other approaches), typical forms (aerogel, hydrogel, beads, and membrane), and applications in the removal of common pollutants (dye, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal ions, VOCs, CO2, PM, and others) in the environment by MOFs&#8208;nanocellulose (MOFs&#8208;NC) composites. The future perspectives and current challenges of MOFs&#8208;NC composites in environmental remediation applications are also pointed out.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in environmental remediation due to their unique properties. However, their practical applications are significantly limited by its powder crystal form. To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass&#8208;derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi&#8208;dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs&#8208;NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2 capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs&#8208;NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationship between multi&#8208;dimensional MOFs&#8208;NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs&#8208;NC composites for future environmental remediation.

         <title>Solving Mazes of Organelle&#8208;Targeted Therapies with DNA Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the evolution of DNA nanomachines as a transformative approach for organelle&#8208;specific cancer treatment. Their design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and enhanced selectivity for precise drug delivery and activation of cell death pathways are examined. Key strategies for subcellular targeting, therapeutic advantages, and the integration of AI&#8208;driven research to accelerate innovation are discussed, providing a roadmap for future clinical translation in advanced cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, cancer remains a growing global health challenge. Nanomaterials&#8208;based therapeutics have shown promise, but their clinical applications are often limited by poor selectivity and undesirable side effects. Recently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based nanomachines have gained attention as intelligent drug carriers due to their ability to precisely target specific organelles. By leveraging rationally designed DNA nanomachines, it is possible to directly attack subcellular structures or deliver therapeutic agents to precise locations, triggering organelle&#8208;mediated cell death. This innovative approach offers several advantages, including enhanced efficacy, lower dosages, minimized off&#8208;target effects, reduced multidrug resistance, and improved therapeutic durability. This review explores the history and advancements of organelle&#8208;targeting strategies, providing new insights into targeting the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes using DNA nanomachines. The review also discusses the structures, design principles, and therapeutic mechanisms of these nanomachines, along with the integration of artificial intelligence&#8208;driven self&#8208;driving laboratories to enhance research growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. Finally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this evolving field are addressed, offering a roadmap for solving the intricate maze of organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapies.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Thermoelectric Strategies for Smart Fire Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoelectric materials for smart fire prevention and early warning. Mechanism&#8208;guided strategies&#8212;such as structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, and ionic thermoelectric effects&#8212;are systematically discussed, offering insights into the development of self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;sensitivity fire warning systems and their integration into next&#8208;generation intelligent fire safety technologies.








Abstract
Fire prevention and early warning systems are essential to minimize fire risks. Thermoelectric (TE) materials that convert temperature gradients into electrical signals offer a promising pathway for designing self&#8208;powered fire&#8208;warning technologies and devices; however, their practical applications are often impeded by their low output power, inefficient charge transport, and poor interfacial compatibility. Despite several relevant reviews focusing on material types, it has remained underexplored from a mechanism&#8208;driven perspective to enhance the fire prevention performance of TE strategies to date. To fill this knowledge gap, this work aims to systematically review TE materials and design strategies, e.g., structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, ionic thermoelectric effects, and interfacial engineering. This work highlights typical applications of TE&#8208;driven fire prevention systems, such as wearable sensors, distributed forest fire monitoring networks, and intelligent building safety systems. Finally, future directions are discussed, which include multifunctional integration, durability under harsh conditions, and AI&#8208;driven fire prediction, paving the way for developing intelligent, self&#8208;powered fire safety technologies. This work underpins how mechanism&#8208;oriented material design advances next&#8208;generation fire warning systems with enhanced sensitivity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous operation, thereby expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation fire&#8208;prevention system and platform.

This work highlights typical applications of TE-driven fire prevention systems, such as wearable sensors, distributed forest fire monitoring networks, and intelligent building safety systems. Finally, future directions are discussed, which include multifunctional integration, durability under harsh conditions, and AI-driven fire prediction, paving the way for developing intelligent, self-powered fire safety technologies. This work underpins how mechanism-oriented material design advances next-generation fire warning systems with enhanced sensitivity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous operation, thereby expediting the creation of next-generation fire-prevention system and platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon stands out with its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and safety. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full&#8208;cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries and inspire future research directions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC&#8208;based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in&#8208;depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full&#8208;cell integration are discussed, such as pre&#8208;sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real&#8208;world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward&#8208;looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium&#8208;ion energy storage.

         <title>Personalized 3D Vaccine Integrates Immunotherapy and Antiangiogenic Therapy to Prevent Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L, a 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post&#8208;surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D&#8208;printed anti&#8208;tumor vaccine (3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L supports facial integrity post&#8208;surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic&#8208;related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post&#8208;surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.

         <title>High Rate Capability and Cycling Stability in Multi&#8208;Domain Nanocomposite LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 Positive Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By targeting nominally non&#8208;stoichiometric LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 compositions, a multi&#8208;domain nanocomposite rock salt positive electrode material with exceptional cycling stability and excellent rate performance is obtained. This enhanced performance particularly under high oxidative potential protocols and cell electrode mass loadings applicable to commercial cells represents a significant advance for LiNiO2&#8208;based positive electrode materials.








Abstract
LiNiO2 positive electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries have experienced a revival of interest due to increasing technological energy demands. Herein a specific Ti4+ substitution is targeted into LiNiO2 to access new compositions by synthesizing the LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 solid solution with the aim of retaining Ni3+. Compositions in the range 0.025 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.2 form nanocomposites of compositionally homogeneous ordered R3&#175;$\bar 3$m and disordered Fm3&#175;$\bar 3$m rock salt domains as observed via X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction, and STEM. The disordered rock salt domains stabilize the ordered structure to provide excellent structural reversibility via the formation of coherent interfaces during cycling and enable deep delithiation using a constant voltage charging step without structural degradation. The detrimental structural phase transitions associated with the poor cyclability of LiNiO2 are suppressed to yield a low strain positive electrode material with high capacity retention that offers high&#8208;rate capability even under increased cell electrode mass loadings. The composition x = 0.075 (LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2) affords a 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles (100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and demonstrates high reversible capacities of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 even under rates of 3200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2 exhibits exceptional performance at electrode mass loadings (13.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) comparable to those required for commercial cell applications.

         <title>A Novel Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Architecture Revealed by Reconfigurable Synapse for Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel double gate&#8208;controlled synapse transistor featuring a graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes heterostructure is developed, enabling reconfigurable synaptic memory to support Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing (TDM)&#8208;based neural networks. More surprisingly, as the scale of the neural network model gradually increases, the benefits of TDM become more pronounced.








Abstract
Deep learning's growing complexity demands advanced AI chips, increasing hardware costs. Time&#8208;division multiplexing (TDM) neural networks offer a promising solution to simplify integration. However, it is difficult for current synapse transistors to physically implement TDM networks due to inherent device limitations, hindering their practical deployment in modern systems. Here, a novel graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synapse transistor featuring a sandwich structure is presented. This transistor enables the realization of TDM neural networks at the hardware level. In this structure, the 2D perovskite layer, characterized by high ion concentration, serves as a neurotransmitter, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission efficiency. Additionally, the CNTs' field&#8208;effect transistors, with their large on&#8208;off ratio, demonstrate a wider range of synaptic current changes. The device mechanism is theoretically analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.

Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Stimulation of Cell&#8208;Based Bioengineered Tissues for In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields enable the construction of 3D tissues from individual cells and their stimulation, activating signaling pathways that influence tissue function. Herein, cyclic magnetic fields induce mechanical perturbations in magnetically responsive tissue implants, promoting osteodifferentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells without biochemical supplementation, enhancing implant integration in vivo, highlighting potential for minimally invasive bone repair strategies.








Abstract
The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano&#8208;instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote&#8208;controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non&#8208;bone environments. MNP&#8208;driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.

         <title>Tri&#8208;System Interlocking Top&#8208;Encased Structures Enabled Highly Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetection Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique tri&#8208;system interlocking top&#8208;encased structure is formed for tin&#8208;lead perovskites by the introduction of novel CGA additive. The fabricated tin&#8208;lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.









Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead binary perovskites show a very broad spectral bandwidth from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and outstanding optoelectronic properties for photodetection applications. However, the oxidation tendency of the divalent tin easily causes severe vacancies and defects, deteriorating the efficiency and stability of the device. In this work, without involving any costly synthesis of additives, a natural reducing agent of chlorogenic acid is proposed to establish a unique top&#8208;encased tri&#8208;system interlocking structure in tin&#8208;lead perovskites. Benefiting from the synergetic closed&#8208;loop interactions among functional groups of the additive with perovskites, tin&#8208;lead perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are demonstrated with improvements in energy&#8208;level alignment, antioxidation, and defect suppression and passivation. Finally, the self&#8208;powered perovskite NIR PDs present a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;76%, an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940&#160;nm, and a large linear dynamic range of 222&#160;dB, along with good stability maintaining 96% of initial photocurrent after 127 days for the unencapsulated PDs storing under N2 atmosphere. By integrating with a 64 &#215; 64 thin&#8208;film transistor array, the tin&#8208;lead perovskite image sensor exhibits clear and accurate imaging properties, paving the way for a wide range of high&#8208;detectivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging applications.

         <title>Signal Transducer Nanoparticles Enable Siglec&#8208;10/G Blockade Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibody&#8208;free approach to block the &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling is achieved through using the CD24 signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). These STNPs effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.








Abstract
Current treatments for breast cancer (BC), particularly triple&#8208;negative BC, are limited in efficacy due to drug resistance and high recurrence rates. CD24, which is highly expressed in BCs and engages with its receptor Siglec&#8208;10/G (Siglec&#8208;10 in humans and Siglec&#8208;G in mice) on immune cells, represents a promising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) target. As the engagement is mediated by a short signal transducer (ST) peptide displayed on the BC cell surface, targeting the peptide using antibodies has shown to be effective for BC treatment. Herein, an antibody&#8208;free approach is reported to achieve blockade of the CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling through the synthesis of signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). The STNPs can effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of BC cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. The therapeutic effects can be further improved through encapsulation of RRx&#8208;001, a small molecule inhibitor of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling. Compared to the antibody approach, the synthetic nanoparticle approach offers greater efficacy with lower side effects and enables combination therapy through a simple formulation. Moreover, the approach is versatile and could be adapted for targeting other ICB signaling, advancing the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>An Intrinsically Stretchable Skin&#8208;Adhesive Actuator With Structurally Anisotropic Multiphase Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator is realized using a hybrid architecture combining anisotropic and isotropic 3D porous dielectric architectures. The seamless integration of an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator ensures reliable haptic feedback even under extreme deformation. Featuring a bio&#8208;inspired design, it forms a conformal contact with human skin, effectively stimulating tactile receptors with high&#8208;vibration acceleration, delivering precise and high&#8208;fidelity feedback.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable actuators require robust adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity feedback to conform to the skin under extreme deformation, integrating seamlessly while minimizing damping effects for diverse practical applications. Current rigid haptic interfaces and soft dielectric materials are limited to operating effectively within specific resonance frequencies, exhibiting a mechanical mismatch with human skin, which reduces their effectiveness on highly deformable body parts and decreases the accuracy of vibration feedback. Moreover, intrinsically stretchable dielectric materials face challenges caused by layer integration and significant damping from single anisotropic architectures. Here, an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator (ISSA) with a multiphase dielectric architecture is presented that combines an isotropic spring matrix and an anisotropic elastic damper matrix, achieving stable vibration performance beyond the resonance frequency. The intrinsically stretchable electrode with its hybrid 1D/0D percolated structure ensures adaptability and reliable performance under strains exceeding 500%, whereas the frog&#8208;inspired adhesive enhances skin conformity and breathability, providing robust shear strength (&#8776;28.4&#160;kPa) under extreme deformation. Owing to a seamlessly integrated design and ultralow modulus (&lt;24&#160;kPa), the skin&#8208;adhesive actuator closely conforms to the human skin, delivering high vibrational acceleration while ensuring biocompatibility and durability for transformative applications in soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and haptic technologies.

         <title>Enhanced Ising Superconductivity and Emergent Ferromagnetism Coexisting in Bimolecule&#8208;Intercalated Bulk TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers report the coexistence of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism in TBAC/DMF&#8208;intercalated TaS2, accompanied by a quantum Griffiths singularity. This structure results in an enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity, with the in&#8208;plane upper critical field reaching five times the Pauli limit and the superconducting temperature increasing to &#8776;2.7 K. Distinct ferromagnetic ordering persists from below the superconducting temperature up to 365 K.








Abstract
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive in most cases. Here the observation of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexisting is reported in a bimolecule (tetrabutylammonium chloride and dimethylformamide, or TBAC/DMF)&#8208;intercalated bulk TaS2, with the exotic phenomenon of quantum Griffiths singularity. It is first shown that the neighboring TaS2 layers are separated by 14.7 &#197;, indicating vertical stacking of the TBAC and DMF molecules. Such a record&#8208;large interlayer spacing renders each TaS2 layer to be of exceptionally 2D nature in an otherwise 3D structure, as manifested by substantially enhanced Ising superconductivity with in&#8208;plane upper critical field five times the Pauli limit. The corresponding superconducting transition temperature is &#8776;2.7 K, more than tripled from that of pristine bulk TaS2 (&#8776;0.8 K), and again approaches that of monolayer TaS2 (&#8776;3 K). Strikingly, distinct ferromagnetism is observed below the superconducting temperature, and the ferromagnetic order persists all the way up to 365 K. These findings characterize TBAC/DMF&#8208;TaS2 as a fertile platform for exploration of rich physical phenomena with significant technological potentials in superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Acousto&#8208;Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)2&#183;2H2O (1, Tc &gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML&#8208;driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.








Abstract
The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real&#8208;life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound&#8208;induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide&#8208;based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)] (BF4)2.2H2O (1) complex with an impressive output peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low&#8208;frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI&#8208;driven voice&#8208;recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dielectric Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Dual&#8208;Band Robust Optical Performance for Low&#8208;Cost Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a gravity&#8208;induced particle aggregation strategy, the distribution of merely 4 vol% packed dielectric silica in the porous skeleton is tuned to yield a decoupled spectral response spanning two orders of magnitude. This strategy allows for on&#8208;demand manufacture of other types of metamaterials and integrates robust weather resistance properties.








Abstract
Radiative cooling belongs to passively enhanced heat dissipation that reflects sunlight and emits infrared radiation. However, conflicting reflectivity and emissivity across the two bands present challenges to reach 95% performance simultaneously, while a few available photonic reports have shortcomings in terms of scalability and environmental stability. The decoupling optimization of scattering and absorption is demonstrated by modulating the aggregation state of merely 4 vol% dielectrics in the porous skeleton. It allows Mie scattering and resonant absorption to function in their respective bands, resulting in a double 95% optical performance. Such a broad spectral response enables high&#8208;throughput heat dissipation of 8&#160;&#176;C and supports subambient cooling of 5&#160;&#176;C outdoors. This one&#8208;step strategy extends to the manufacture of a range of metamaterials as required for strength, heat resistance, and degradation, combined with robust environmental stability, including resistance to fouling and peeling.

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal&#8208;Based Physical Unclonable Function Integrating Optical and Electrical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable physical unclonable function (PUF) integrating optical and electrical responses in organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by using unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic liquid crystal. This approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;a hardware&#8208;based security device using randomness&#8212;have evolved from basic integrated circuit designs to advanced systems using diverse materials and mechanisms. However, most PUFs are limited by single&#8208;factor challenges and fixed key generation, making them vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks. A reconfigurable and multidimensional liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based PUF is presented integrated into an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) to address limitations. This system combines optical and electrical PUFs through unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic LC material. The PUF can be reconfigured by a simple heating and cooling process, overcoming the limitations of fixed&#8208;structure PUFs. Furthermore, this approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication due to the multi&#8208;response factors, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method is presented for single&#8208;protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost&#8208;effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.









Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross&#8208;section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single&#8208;molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary&#8208;Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

     alt="High-Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A label-free method is presented for single-protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost-effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross-section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single-molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary-Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost-effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real-time Raman detection is achieved with a Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single-molecule detection at 1&#160;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label-free, high-resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flippase&#8208;Mediated Hybrid Vesicle Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p flippase in small and giant polymer lipid hybrid vesicles is illustrated. The hybrid vesicles show adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate consumption and flipping of 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. This induced transmembrane asymmetry results in constriction and division of the giant hybrid vesicles.








Abstract
The assembly of synthetic systems with the ability for protein&#8208;mediated division remains a challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here, the reconstitution of an active Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p lipid flippase in polymer lipid hybrid vesicles (HVs) made from phospholipids and 1 or 2.5 mol% amphiphilic block copolymers, with poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) or poly(6&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose) as the hydrophilic extension and either cholesteryl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate or combinations thereof as the hydrophobic blocks is demonstrated. The reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p in HVs flip 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine (DOPS) lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet, leading to transmembrane asymmetry. Importantly, the chemical nature of the hydrophobic block in the amphiphilic block copolymers used to assemble the HVs is crucial to support changes in the spontaneous curvature of the bilayers due to translocation of DOPS lipids that results in HV constriction and division. Taken together, this effort is a step forward in imitating cell division in synthetic assemblies toward potentially bottom&#8208;up assembled self&#8208;replicating units.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Rashba Effect with Suppressed Spin Relaxation in a Polar Phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with enhanced spin&#8208;relaxation time in a new polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 (x &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.34). Unlike typical Rashba systems, which suffer from rapid spin relaxation, this polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 exhibits both high Rashba strength and long spin&#8208;relaxation time due to a polar&#8208;crystal symmetry with a unidirectional spin texture. This work expands Rashba physics to 3D systems, with potential for spintronic devices.








Abstract
The Rashba effect enables control over the spin degree of freedom, particularly in polar materials where the polar symmetry couples to Rashba&#8208;type spin splitting. The exploration of this effect, however, has been hindered by the scarcity of polar materials exhibiting the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect and rapid spin&#8208;relaxation effects dictated by the D'yakonov&#8211;Perel mechanism. Here, a polar LiNbO3&#8208;type R3c phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 with x &#8776;0.15&#8211;0.24 is stabilized via epitaxial growth, which exhibits a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with suppressed spin relaxation as a result of its unidirectional spin texture. As compared to the previously observed non&#8208;polar Pnma phase, this polar phase exhibits higher conductivity, reduced bandgap, and enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric responses. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and multimodal magnetotransport measurements, which reveal weak (anti)localization, anisotropic magnetoresistance, planar&#8208;Hall effect, and nonreciprocal charge transport, a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect without rapid spin relaxation is demonstrated. These findings offer insights into spin&#8208;orbit coupling physics within polar oxides and suggest potential spintronic applications.

         <title>mTORC1 Selective Nano&#8208;Inhibitor by Disrupting the Lysosomal Arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208; mTORC1&#8208;CDKs Axis for Precision Bladder Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A strategy for mTORC1 specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway is presented. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a paradigm, nanomedicines like ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO are developed. They degrade Arg in lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 and mTORC1.








Abstract
The absence of precise targeting and defined mechanisms, akin to small molecules, remains a major barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism, is linked to abnormal activation in various diseases like cancers. While small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of mTORC1 are limited, they remain a focus. Here, a strategy is presented for mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine (Arg)&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a universal paradigm, nanomedicines are developed (e.g., ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO) that degrade Arg in the lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 activation and blocking mTORC1 recruitment. ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO inhibits mTORC1 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.07 ng mL&#8722;1), with three orders of magnitude greater specificity than the clinical small molecule rapamycin. SLC38A9 knockout abolishes nanomedicine efficacy. Differential responses to the inhibitors are also observed in normal and bladder cancer cells, linked to SLC38A9 expression levels, suggesting potential for precise treatment of non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In vivo, ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO combined with photodynamic therapy outperformed MMC in preventing tumor recurrence and extending survival. This work establishes a promising approach for developing mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors with well&#8208;defined targets and mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of precision nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

A solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed to in situ synthesize perovskite QD/polymer composites, which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new&#8208;generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X&#8208;ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability. However, there is still a lack of feasible strategies to achieve large&#8208;scale production of perovskite QD&#8208;based polymer composites. In this study, a solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed enable to continuously production of perovskite QD/polymer composites using a screw extruder. Rational raw material selection allows QDs to be uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, resulting in efficient luminescent features (e.g., the green CsPbBr3 QD/PS composites with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%). Meanwhile, polymer encapsulation obviously enhances the stability of QDs against the external environment. Importantly, the strategy is a continuous process (only raw material loading is required), which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. Furthermore, the potential applications of as&#8208;prepared QD&#8208;based polymer composites is demonstrated in various light conversion fields, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), scintillators, displays, and luminescent textiles. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.

         <title>Reversible Thermochromic Organosilicon Fibers Based on TiO2@AgI Composites: Preparation, Properties, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;high temperature reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber is prepared by a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method, which has a large color difference (&#916;E = 25.72), excellent cyclic stability (170 times), and high sensitivity (135.4&#160;&#176;C). The fiber also combines high strength (9.89&#8211;11.33 MPa), durability (500 times), biocompatibility, and antimicrobial properties, and is suitable for use in the field of medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.








Abstract
The application of reversible thermochromic fibers (RTFs) is expanding from the smart wearable field toward industrial temperature detection and safety warning; however, most RTFs suffer from low color change temperature thresholds and poor thermal stability, which restrict their applications in medium and high&#8208;temperature places (&gt;100&#160;&#176;C). Currently, overheating of equipment is a key factor that causes safety accidents, and the development of reliable visualized temperature warning materials is of great practical significance for accident prevention. To address these issues, TiO2@AgI is blended with a ternary organosilicon oil spinning solution via a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method to obtain a reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber (TSiF) suitable for use in medium and high&#8208;temperature environments owing to its thermal stability. Among them, TiO&#8322;@AgI1.1@SiF&#8208;2 has the best performance, showing a significant white to bright yellow color change (color difference &#916;E = 25.72) at 135.4&#160;&#176;C. It still possesses the thermochromic performance after 170 cycles and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 9.89&#8211;11.33&#160;MPa, no decay in 500 cycles), significant biocompatibility and antimicrobial ability, which fully meets the requirements for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning. Thus, this study provides a new idea for fabricating RTFs that can be used for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.

         <title>Accompanying Structural Transformations in Polarity Switching of Heavily Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity switching of heavily doped p&#8208;type conjugated polymers (CPs) toward environmentally stable electron&#8208;rich thin films is demonstrated. Multiscale analyses, incorporating spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scattering techniques, reveal structural and chemical transformations induced by excessive doping with AuCl3. Leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a flexible homojunction p&#8208;n diode is fabricated using a single CP&#8208;dopant system with a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of &#8776;105.








Abstract
Despite significant recent advancements in highly functional organic semiconductors (OSCs), the n&#8208;type OSCs reported to date lag behind their p&#8208;type counterparts in terms of long&#8208;term environmental stability. As an alternative approach to n&#8208;type materials, a few p&#8208;type polymers have been shown to undergo dramatic transitions in their charge carrier polarity to n&#8208;type through transition metal&#8208;incorporated Lewis acid doping. Although the concept of polarity switching is promising, its unclear chemical origin&#8212;particularly from a materials science perspective&#8212;limits its potential as an n&#8208;type counterpart. In this work, the chemical and structural mechanisms underlying the p&#8208;to&#8208;n polarity switching in a heavily doped conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using gold(III) chloride&#8208;doped indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) as a model system, doping&#8208;induced thin&#8208;film structural changes are investigated. Quantitative X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of doped IDTBT films provides direct evidence of oxidation state changes in Au and Cl ions and confirms the covalent chlorination of the polymer backbone, establishing a direct correlation between the chemical doping mechanism and polarity switching. Finally, leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a p&#8208;n homojunction organic diode is demonstrated with a rectification ratio of 104&#8211;105, highlighting the versatility and potential of this excessively p&#8208;doped n&#8208;type OSC system for tailoring charge transport properties.

         <title>Unveiling Competitive Coordination in Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Electrolytes through Solvent Descriptor Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically establishes co&#8208;solvents selection criteria to achieve balanced solvation behavior by exploring the impacts of &#603; and &#181; on solvation structure. Cosolvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) with moderate &#603; (&#603; = 37.8) and high &#181; (&#181; = 3.7 D), can counterbalance the fast diffusion capabilities of water molecules, thereby reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. The LDH&#8208;2 m electrolyte enables the suppressed HER and formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical window and unstable hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of aqueous electrolytes hinder the potential application of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These problems are actually related to the solvation structure of the electrolyte, which is determined by the competition among anions, water molecules, and cosolvent coordinated with Li+. Herein, this work proposes a direct solvent descriptor for conveniently designing electrolytes, which facilitates a pronounced level of Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; and Li+&#8208;DMAC coordination within the solvation sheath through synergistic effect of the dielectric constant and dipole moment. This strategy significantly reduces the involvement of water in the primary solvation shell and generates stable interfacial chemistry. Such an electrolyte regulated by competitive coordination leads to wide electrochemical stability window of 4.55 V and suppressed HER, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8208;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with the high discharge capacity of 138.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and average Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 1000 cycles at 3 C rate. The proposed strategy of solvation structure modification by regulating cation competitive coordination offers a promising approach for achieving stable aqueous batteries with high energy density.

This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small&#8208;area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their unsatisfactory operational stability and lead (Pb) leakage remain major obstacles to commercialization. Nevertheless, with the Pb precipitation mechanism remaining elusive, the community has long been under the impression that preventing Pb leakage mainly lies in the out&#8208;film encapsulation. Here, that in&#8208;film reinforcement is demonstrated through the synergy of built&#8208;in chemical sealing networks encapsulating and balanced compressive strain field plays a pivotal role in elevating the thermodynamic barrier for structural dissociation, thereby preventing Pb leakage from severely damaged devices exposed to external stimuli. Through in situ planar&#8208;resolved cathodoluminescence and depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering, the spatial evolution of secondary Pb phases is further elucidated within the perovskite films. Consequently, a remarkable 96.98% inhibition rate for Pb leakage from damaged PSCs is achieved. Furthermore, the impressive PCEs of 26.11% in a cell (0.10&#160;cm2) and 20.41% in a module (100&#160;cm2) are achieved. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs maintain 97.05% of their initial PCE over 2160&#160;h under humidity ambient. This work highlights the conceptual insights into mitigating Pb leakage by controlling in&#8208;film structural rigidity, thus paving the way for the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Transient Unilateral Adhesive Recombinant Collagen&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Reversible Fibrosis Induction and Full&#8208;Cycle Management of Pancreatic Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, injectable recombinant collagen&#8208;based hydrogel plug with targeted drug delivery is developed for full&#8208;cycle management of pancreatic fistula. Featuring enzyme resistance, transient unilateral adhesion, and reversible fibrosis induction, this hydrogel achieves 100% sealing efficiency and provides comprehensive therapeutic effects, including hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and reversible inhibition of exocrine function. This study pioneers the application of sequence&#8208;engineered recombinant collagen in pancreatic fistula treatment.








Abstract
Currently, no effective treatment for pancreatic fistula (PF) exists, which has a mortality rate &gt;40%. Existing protein&#8208;based physical barriers face the challenges of rapid degradation, lack of self&#8208;adhesiveness, and the inability to promote PF healing. To overcome this, a novel enzyme&#8208;resistant and highly bioactive hydrogel (CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II)) is developed using glycidyl methacrylate recombinant collagen (enzyme&#8208;cleavage&#8208;free) and oxidized pullulan as backbone molecules, which is further loaded with a penicillin G&#8208;Cu(II) infinite coordination polymer nanomedicine. This hydrogel can adapt to irregular PF wounds through injectable self&#8208;leveling and achieve transient unilateral adhesion via light&#8208;activated radical crosslinking with tissue&#8208;inherent molecules. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its ability to provide full&#8208;cycle PF management by serving as a long&#8208;lasting physical barrier while offering antimicrobial properties, rapid hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, reversible fibrosis induction, and enhancing pancreatic tissue repair. The anti&#8208;PF efficacy of the CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II) hydrogel at day 7 is 100%, highlighting its strong potential for clinical postoperative PF prevention.

         <title>Synergistic Compound Additives for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite electrolyte with LiNO&#8323;, SAC, and OP&#8208;10 additives stabilizes lithium anodes and suppresses polysulfide shuttling in Li&#8211;S batteries. This strategy enables Li||Li symmetric cells to cycle under the challenging condition of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 1400 h and enhances high&#8208;loading sulfur cathode performance, offering a promising electrolyte engineering approach for advanced metal&#8208;based energy storage systems.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, with theoretical energy densities exceeding 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, are poised to revolutionize energy storage. However, their practical viability hinges on resolving two critical challenges: uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth at the anode and polysulfide shuttling at the sulfur cathode. Here, a compound additive integrating lithium nitrate (LiNO3), sodium saccharin (SAC), and octaphenyl polyoxyethylene (OP&#8208;10) is proposed to construct an electrolyte for Li&#8211;S battery. With the compound additive added, the as&#8208;prepared electrolyte is capable of evolving a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with refined morphology while suppressing polysulfide reactivity. The synergistic effects of this additive enable Li|Li symmetric cells to achieve unprecedented cycling stability (&gt;1400 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and Li&#8211;S full cells with high sulfur loading (4.12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) to retain 2.72 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 150 cycles. This work underscores the importance of dual&#8208;electrode stabilization in electrolyte design, offering a scalable strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries and related systems plagued by dendrites and shuttle effects. This study highlights the effectiveness of synergistic electrolyte engineering in suppressing lithium dendrites and polysulfide shuttling, providing new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and other energy storage systems facing similar challenges.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Stacking Fault&#8208;Free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 unveils in&#8208;plane sliding of corrugated MnO2 as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn&#8208;based layered oxides for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Understanding the solid&#8208;state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&#946;&#8208;NaMnO2) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &#945;&#8208;type planar domains among &#946;&#8208;type corrugated MnO2 layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 yields SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF&#8208;free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers.

&lt;p&gt;An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unveils in-plane sliding of corrugated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn-based layered oxides for long-life Na-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the solid-state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-type planar domains among &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-type corrugated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields SF-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF-free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers. The proposed gliding mechanism is validated both experimentally, using ex situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and theoretically, through density functional theory calculations. Minor structural changes observed in SF-containing materials indicated that gliding is extremely sensitive to SFs. Given that the SF-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-material exhibits excellent cycle stability in a Na cell, the corrugated layer is concluded to have high resilience and reversibility against repeated large anisotropic structural changes involving slab gliding, providing a new insight into the design of long-life rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transparent Anti&#8208;Icing Moir&#233;&#8208;Film Enhancing Photovoltaic Stability in Extreme Cold Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving effective de&#8208;icing without sacrificing photovoltaic efficiency remains challenging. A scalable, transparent photothermal film is developed with moir&#233; structures that enable efficient ice removal and restore winter solar output. Under snow&#8208;covered conditions, it achieves up to a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power generation.








Abstract
Accelerated degradation and power loss of solar cells in cold climates remain major challenges to renewable energy deployment. The photothermal film offers a promising solution by converting sunlight into heat to remove ice and snow from solar panels. However, enhancing photothermal performance often entails reduced visible (VIS) light transmittance of films, thereby compromising solar cell efficiency. Tailoring optical designs to balance the optimal light absorption between the device and the film is essential for photovoltaic anti&#8208;icing/snow. Herein, we present outdoor data from grid&#8208;connected photovoltaic modules, revealing a 58% electricity loss caused by ice/snow shading effects. To address this, we developed transparent photothermal films featuring a moir&#233; light&#8208;trapping structure, achieving high VIS transmittance (&#8764;93.0%) and enhanced near&#8208;infrared absorption (&#8764;65.8%). We confirmed that the meter&#8208;scale photothermal film ensures that operational modules remain ice&#8208;free in &#8722;20 &#176;C outdoor conditions, and the ice&#8208;melting phase diagram indicates its effective anti&#8208;icing range down to &#8722;30 &#176;C under AM 1.5G, one&#8208;sun illumination. Day&#8208;night cycling tests on perovskite cells demonstrated sustained anti&#8208;icing performance, yielding a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power output during winter conditions. The film's long&#8208;term stability and robust de&#8208;icing performance under weak&#8208;light scenarios demonstrate the its feasibility for extreme cold applications.

         <title>Dual Roles of Deep Eutectic Solvent in Polysulfide Redox and Catalysis for Intermediate&#8208;Temperature Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

A dual&#8208;functional NiS&#8208;DES interfacial strategy enables highly reversible K2S2/K2S conversion in intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries by balancing adsorption and activation of intermediates at the catalytic interface, achieving high capacity, long cycle life, and low&#8208;cost energy storage.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8208;S) batteries hold great promise for long&#8208;duration energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the irreversible deposition of K2S2/K2S severely hinders sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Herein, a NiS&#8211;DES interfacial regulation strategy is developed that leverages the dual functionality of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) to govern the adsorption and conversion behavior of K2S2/K2S at the catalytic interface, enabling their highly reversible transformation. Specifically, DES forms moderate electronic coupling with NiS to weaken the excessively strong adsorption of K2S and prevent catalyst deactivation. Simultaneously, strong electronic interactions between DES and K2S promote interfacial activation and conversion, thereby extending the reaction pathway and enhancing reduction depth. As a result, the intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries deliver an initial capacity of 810 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a minimal capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle over 1300 cycles at 6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading. Even under lean catholyte (4.2 &#181;L&#160;mg[sulfur]&#8722;1) and higher sulfur loading (12&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), they achieve 521 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 initially, retaining stability with 0.03%/cycle decay over 500 cycles. This NiS&#8208;30DES system achieves a cell&#8208;level energy density exceeding 150&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a low levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $140/MWh, demonstrating strong potential for scalable long&#8208;duration energy storage.

         <title>Revisiting the Impact of Anion Selection on Sulfur Redox Reaction Kinetics for High Sulfur Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Sulfur redox reactions are systematically evaluated with nine commercial lithium salts and developed a new LiTFSI&#8208;free, PFAS&#8208;free electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. LiBOB, once considered incompatible, forms a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, suppressing the shuttle effect and delivering excellent performance in high&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S cells, offering a more sustainable electrolyte strategy.








Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is widely used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery electrolytes due to its stability with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and moderate compatibility with lithium metal anodes. However, LiTFSI presents environmental concerns due to its association with per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic, raises sustainability concerns. This research also reveals that LiTFSI limits sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), making it less effective than other lithium salts.&#160;Additionally, some salts previously considered incompatible with Li&#8208;S systems due to their reactivity with LiPSs are demonstrated to perform effectively. For the first time, a protective, porous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed in situ through reactions between salt anions and LiPS is reported. The cells delivered a high specific capacity of 1230.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C with a sulfur loading of &#8776;6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, limited lithium anode, maintaining a capacity retention of 76.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Under harsh conditions, such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), and in anode&#8208;free cells, the cells continued to deliver outstanding capacity. This work provides valuable guidelines for understanding and selecting lithium salts to advance electrolyte design for Li&#8211;S batteries.

Organic near&#8208;inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real&#8208;time pain relief for medical application advancing.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology.

Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on-demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near-infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk-heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones.

         <title>Tailored Heterogeneous Interphase Layer Promotes Low&#8208;Temperature Desolvation Toward Durable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous artificial interphase is constructed to stabilize sodium metal anodes at subzero temperatures. The tailored sodiophilic interface facilitates Na+ desolvation and regulates uniform deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work offers a practical strategy to enhance interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries.









Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology due to their low cost and high energy density. However, SMBs face significant challenges, including interfacial instability and the growth of sodium dendrites on the metal anode, particularly at low temperatures (LTs). Poor ion desolvation at LTs further exacerbates these issues, severely compromising battery performance. To address these problems, a heterogeneous artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of Na3VO4 and metallic In (NVO&#8208;In@Na) is designed for LT SMBs. The sodiophilic Na3VO4 promotes sodium ion adsorption, while the Na2In phase formed during the initial plating enhances ion transport kinetics, resulting in uniform Na deposition behavior. Theory calculations indicate that the Na3VO4/Na2In interface accelerates charge transfer processes and desolvation. The engineered NVO&#8208;In@Na anode demonstrates exceptional stability: symmetric cells operate for over 2000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions and exceed 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Full cells paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode retain 97% capacity after 1150 cycles at 0.5 C and &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of rational SEI design to overcome critical limitations of SMBs, advancing high&#8208;performance energy storage under extreme conditions.

         <title>Subsurface Electron Trap Enabled Long&#8208;Cycling Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the subsurface electron confinement in Mo&#8208;based catalysts by incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms as subsurface traps. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies Mo&#8211;O orbital hybridization, stabilizing lithium oxalate while suppressing the formation of lithium carbonate. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries exhibit unprecedented efficiencies and cycling stabilities at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries promise ultrahigh theoretical energy densities but face efficiency limitations owing to the sluggish decomposition of stable Li2CO3. Redirecting the redox pathway toward Li2C2O4 overcomes this challenge, but its metastability leads to facile conversion to Li2CO3 during discharge. Herein, subsurface electronic confinement is engineered in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, leveraging electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) as electron traps in the subsurface atomic layers to tailor their interfacial electronic landscapes. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies the hybridization between the Mo d&#8208;orbitals and O p&#8208;orbitals of oxalate. Strengthening the Mo&#8208;O interaction stabilizes Li2C2O4 against decomposition. The highly reversible and stable redox chemistry enabled by MoB results in an exceptional cycling stability and energy efficiency across a wide temperature range, with an expanded practical viability. At 70&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, the MoB&#8208;based battery is cycled for &gt;1400&#160;h with a high energy efficiency of &gt;85%. The energy efficiency even remains at &gt;90% for &#8776;150&#160;h at a high temperature (90&#160;&#176;C). This study pioneers a material design framework for use in stabilizing metastable products within Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, advancing their applicabilities in extreme environments, such as deep&#8208;earth exploration, by revealing the role of subsurface charge redistribution in steering reaction pathways.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Bifunctional Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Induce the Directional Generation of Radical in Catalytic Ozonation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This bifunctional catalyst synergizes Ca&#9472;O alkaline sites (boosting &#183;OH generation) and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers (dominate the generation of &#183;O2&#8208;), establishing a selective radical generation pathway and achieving &gt;99.9% removal of refractory pollutants (oxalic acid, atrazine) in 30 min with 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold enhancements over conventional AOPs. This work offers a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS control in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate critical redox processes in contaminant degradation, precise regulation of radical speciation remains fundamentally constrained by the heterogeneity in active site configurations and coordination microenvironments. Here, a site&#8208;specific engineering strategy is demonstrated through spatially organized Ca&#9472;O basic sites and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers, fabricated via Ca2+&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;linking of sodium alginate. Mechanistic studies reveal that the alkaline Ca&#9472;O domains enhance spin density of *OO intermediates to promote hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation, while adjacent acidic Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si moieties simultaneously lower *O formation energy barrier and suppress *OO conversion, establishing a selective radical generation pathway. This bifunctional design achieves near&#8208;complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of recalcitrant pollutants including oxalic acid and atrazine within 30&#160;min, demonstrating 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold rate enhancement over conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The engineered catalyst maintains stable efficiency over 20 cycles in actual wastewater treatment processes, providing a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS manipulation in water treatment.

Abstract
Migratory animals with magnetic receptors can sense the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon known as magnetoreception, and use it for long&#8208;distance navigation. Nevertheless, research on flexible luminescent magnetic sensors, particularly those suitable for both aerial and underwater environments, remains extremely underdeveloped. Herein, enlightened by the magnetic perception ability of migratory animals, an air and underwater dual&#8208;environment bionic luminescent magnetic sensor (HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric) is initiatively fabricated by electroplating hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;14) onto nickel&#8208;based conductive fabric via a coordinated electrodeposition method. In both air and underwater environments, HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric exhibits ultrafast response speed (40 and 240 ms), ultralow detection limit (0.0227 and 0.0337 mT), ultrahigh sensitivity (1510.23 and 51.89 T&#8722;1), ultrahigh measurement accuracy (relative standard deviation &#8804; 0.52% and 0.097%), and great repeatability (900 and 540 cycles), respectively. Finite element simulation analysis of displacement and magnetic flux density changes for HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric reveals that the magnetic response mechanism can be attributed to the magnetic&#8208;caused bending behavior resulting from magnetic attraction. Additionally, underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air&#8208;underwater dual&#8208;environment magnetic intelligent real&#8208;time monitoring are further materialized. This work opens up a brand&#8208;new path for the application of luminescent (fluorescent) sensors in the field of dual&#8208;environment magnetic sensing.

         <title>Valence and Site Engineering Enable Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at 960 nm in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Forsterite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent material (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr,5%Li) with efficient (EQE = 48%) ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM &#8776; 2413 cm&#8722;1 (226&#160;nm)) NIR emission at 960&#160;nm upon blue&#8208;light excitation. This innovation addresses the low efficiency of long&#8208;wavelength (&#955;max &gt; 900&#160;nm) NIR&#8208;emitting materials due to the radiationless de&#8208;activation and the low absorption efficiency of Cr3+ activators.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light sources hold great potential for applications in night vision illumination, bio&#8208;imaging, and non&#8208;destructive testing. However, radiationless de&#8208;activation and low absorption restrict the development of high&#8208;efficiency blue light excitable NIR phosphors, especially for emissions beyond 900&#160;nm. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cr3+&#8208;activated forsterite (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr3+, 5%Li+) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li+ as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr4+ formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr3+ d&#8208;d forbidden transitions in Mg2SiO4. More importantly, Li+ promotes excited&#8208;state energy transfer between Cr3+ emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non&#8208;destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.

         <title>Polarization Signal Amplification of 2D GeSe&#8208;Based Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based amplification circuit is developed to significantly enhance the polarization ratio (PR) of 2D GeSe polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, improving PR from 2.1 to 54.8 (over 25&#8208;fold enhancement). This amplified polarization signal directly contributes to higher recognition accuracy in defect detection systems, concurrently reducing the computational costs of convolutional neural networks (CNN)&#160;by over 60%.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on&#8208;chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation&#8208;dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization&#8208;induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT&#8208;Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high&#8208;PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aqueous Reforming of Methyl Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3d&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed photocatalyst, supported on modified g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;, facilitates the photocatalytic selective hydrogen (7.5 mmol gcat&#8722;1 of hydrogen; nothing else than H2 and CO2) generation from methyl formate. This diverse system functions under mild conditions, providing high hydrogen yield, selectivity, and enduring stability. Through characterization and mechanistic investigations uncover a radical approach, offering a sustainable foundation for the future advancement of liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technologies utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals.








Abstract
Green hydrogen is critical to establish a sustainable energy future as it offers a clean, renewable, and a versatile alternative for decarbonizing industries, transportation, and power generation. However, the limitations of current methods significantly restrict the scope and hinder many of the envisioned applications. This study aims to report on the first example of a 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based (Cu) heterogeneous photocatalytic system to produce green hydrogen via dehydrogenation of methyl formate (MF), a reaction previously known to require 4d/5d transition metals. Employing a Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalyst supported on aryl&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (d&#8208;gC3N4), the protocol offers numerous key advantages, including the recyclability of the photocatalyst for &gt;10 cycles without significant activity loss, sustained hydrogen production (&gt;15 days!) with high hydrogen yield (19.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1) and negligible CO emission, following an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient catalytic pathway. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is characterized (using HAADF&#8208;STEM, SS&#8208;NMR, XAS, EPR, and XPS), all of which clearly demonstrated the presence of single atomic Cu&#8208;site. Additionally, comprehensive mechanistic investigations together with DFT calculations allow for a thorough mechanistic rationale for this reaction. It is strongly believed that this atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalytic approach will open new avenues for establishing liquid organic hydrogen career (LOHC) technologies.

         <title>Switching off Competing Hydrogen Formation in CO2 Electroreduction via Substrate Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that graphitized carbon nanotubes enhance the selectivity of Ni phthalocyanine catalysts for CO2 reduction by preserving the Ni&#8208;N4 coordination structure. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory confirm that defect engineering suppresses hydrogen evolution. The findings highlight a cost&#8208;effective strategy for scalable, selective CO production using immobilized molecular catalysts.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used as supports for immobilizing molecular electrocatalysts, such as for CO2 reduction (CO2R), with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions often assumed to govern the catalyst immobilization. However, the nature of catalyst/CNTs interactions remains insufficiently understood. Here, nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) is investigated, a benchmark CO2R catalyst, supported on CNTs. NiPc preferentially anchors at defect&#8208;sites on CNTs rather than adsorbing uniformly via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking is found, an observation validated by theoretical simulations. Notably, CNTs with the fewest defects, despite exhibiting non&#8208;uniform NiPc distribution, deliver the highest CO2R activity and CO selectivity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that high defect densities induce D4h symmetry distortion of the NiPc macrocycle under cathodic bias, compromising catalyst integrity and CO2R performance. Guided by these insights, CNT defect density is optimized via thermal graphitization, yielding a NiPc/CNT composite with unprecedented selectivity (CO:H2 &gt; 16&#160;100:1) and a turnover frequency of 1072&#160;s&#8315;1 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus RHE, switching off the competing hydrogen formation. Integrated into a 100&#160;cm2 zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, the optimized catalyst sustains 50&#160;A current with &gt;95% CO selectivity at &#8776;3.5&#160;V, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ag&#8208;based systems. This work establishes CNT defect&#8208;engineering as an effective strategy for advancing molecular catalysts for CO2R electrolysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE&#8208;TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE&#8208;TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer&#8208;based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer&#8208;based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high&#8208;temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;temperature enhancing TENG (HTE&#8208;TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&#8722;2 under a 109 &#937; load. This work provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to serve in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.

         <title>Realizing Multicolor, 3D&#8208;Printable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence PLA Materials via Regulating the &#960;&#8208;System of Aryl&#8208;Annulated Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the &#960;&#8208; system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, full&#8208;color (440 &#8211; 628 nm) is achieved, ultralong lifetimes (251 &#8211; 3841 ms), and bright (&#934;pmax = 19%) RTP emission in PLA matrix, representing the best performance among reported PLA&#8208;based RTP materials. Leveraging the unique thermoplasticity of polymers, versatile RTP filaments are fabricated through extrusion processing and create intricate RTP objects via FDM printing or 3D printing pens.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based degradable organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) polymers should become a mainstream research topic in the future. Meanwhile, shaping URTP polymers into 3D&#8208;printable materials is of great significance for applications in optical and optoelectronic fields. Nevertheless, the fabrication of full&#8208;color, ultralong, bright, and 3D printable bio&#8208;based RTP polymer materials using a single&#8208;dopant component still faces significant challenges. Here, by regulating the &#960;&#8208;system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, the triplet energy levels are successfully regulated which enabled wavelength&#8208;tunable RTP emissions spanning from blue to red afterglow (440 &#8211; 628 nm) in PLA matrix. Non&#8208;radiative decay of dopant triplet excitons are effectively suppressed by the rigid environment of polymer matrix and dopant&#8208;polymer interactions. This enables the prepared PLA&#8208;based RTP materials exhibited ultralong lifetimes of 3.84 s and the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible afterglow duration up to 48 s. Recyclable and reprocessable RTP objects are fabricated via 3D printing and are successfully applied in the fields of artworks, monitoring and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This successfully expands the application of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials in 3D fields, and will promote the commercialization of RTP materials and the development of environmentally friendly ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Contact Transfer Epitaxy of Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing a halide perovskite thin film (donor) into contact with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of oriented perovskite nanocrystals (acceptor) at elevated temperature leads to epitaxial transfer of halide perovskite from the donor to the acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate controls the crystal orientation and grain size, while the donor substrate controls the composition.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials are very exciting because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and simple deposition with both solution and vapor&#8208;phase methods. Until now, solution deposition has received more attention, but there are growing indications that residual solvent may limit performance and in particular long&#8208;term stability. Evaporation is a promising alternative, but is more complicated to implement; it requires vacuum, multiple sources at different temperatures, is difficult to switch between different materials due to cross&#8208;contamination and typically leads to films with very small grain size. Here a novel contact transfer method is presented for fabricating single crystalline perovskites that maintains the simplicity and flexibility of solution deposition while avoiding the use of solvent. This contact transfer epitaxy method uses an acceptor substrate consisting of self&#8208;assembled perovskite nanocubes to control crystal orientation and a donor substrate of the desired perovskite film to determine the ultimate composition. By heating the two substrates under close contact in atmospheric conditions, the perovskite film is transferred from the donor to the acceptor substrate, showing cubic phase (100) orientation even with hexagonal donor films. It is shown that contact transfer epitaxy is compatible with a variety of compositions and does not require specialized evaporators or vacuum conditions.

         <title>Development of a Vaginal Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel for Combating Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.








Abstract
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is initiated by the hypoestrogenic state consequent to cessation of ovarian function and involves changes in all vaginal layers. These alterations include decreased epithelial proliferation and differentiation, impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, pro&#8208;inflammatory immune milieu, and smooth muscle atrophy. Patient satisfaction with existing treatments for GSM is low, due in part to their lack of therapeutic effect throughout all vaginal layers and reliance on hormonal treatments. Decellularized ECM therapeutics are known to facilitate soft tissue repair in a variety of applications. Thus, a porcine vaginal tissue&#8208;derived decellularized ECM (vECM) hydrogel suitable for noninvasive topical intravaginal administration is developed specifically for vaginal repair. When applied in a rat model of surgical menopause, vECM significantly improves vaginal epithelial thickness and epithelial stem cell phenotype. Despite topical intravaginal application, vECM is also observed in the lamina propria and fibromuscularis, exerting a regenerative effect on the vaginal smooth muscle layer. Furthermore, vECM modulates macrophage density and promotes pro&#8208;regenerative M2&#8208;like phenotype within the vaginal tissue. Overall, the work herein demonstrates a new nonhormonal biomaterial treatment that counteracts pathological vaginal alterations &#8211; a hallmark of GSM &#8211; in an established preclinical model of menopause.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Microwave&#8208;Assisted Volumetric Heating Engineered Defect&#8208;Free Ceria/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells</title>

This study proposes a transformative approach for fabricating highly dense and thin ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes for solid oxide electrochemical cells using microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering at unprecedentedly low temperatures and short processing times, achieving excellent performance and durability.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) hold significant promise as a sustainable energy conversion technology due to their high efficiency and minimal environmental impact. However, their development faces critical challenges, particularly in achieving dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes necessary to fully leverage state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cobaltite&#8208;based oxygen electrodes. In this study, a microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering process is successfully employed as a transformative alternative to the conventional, time&#8208;intensive sintering approach, enabling the fabrication of highly dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes. This innovative method reduced processing time by over 30&#8208;fold compared to convection sintering and achieved a record&#8208;low sintering temperature of 1200&#160;&#176;C. SOCs fabricated with these volumetric heating&#8208;engineered bilayer electrolytes demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance, delivering a maximum power density of 2.43&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.16&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 750&#160;&#176;C in electrolysis mode, alongside excellent long&#8208;term durability. Furthermore, advanced digital twin analysis revealed the critical correlation between microstructural features and electrochemical performance, providing new insights into SOC optimization. This work highlights the potential of microwave&#8208;assisted sintering as a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for advancing high&#8208;performance SOC technologies.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>de novo Fabrication of Dense Collagen Matrices with Patterned Hierarchical Structures for Corneal Stromal Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, it is reported that top&#8208;down inputs can be coupled with contextual cues control to guide the bottom&#8208;up assembly of collagen to form dense matrices with spatially&#8208;defined mesoscale structures: i) mild electrical inputs electro&#8208;assemble collagen molecules into a dense metastable state composed of partially assembled molten fibrils; ii) permissive contextual cues (especially controlled humidity) enable these molten fibrils to undergo further hierarchical assembly, to form a stable thickened fibril state; and iii) spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs can induce riboflavin&#8208;based photocrosslinking to locally trap the structure of metastable molten fibril state and yield a stable state with thin fibrils. This approach can de novo fabricate biomimetic patterned collagens (e.g., cornea&#8208;sclera structure). It is envisioned that this work provides a generic approach for controlling collagen's multiscale assembly for a broad range of biomedical applications.








Abstract
Collagen is a versatile biological building block that is guided by extracellular cues to self&#8208;assemble into diverse hierarchical structures that perform various tissue functions. Here, the use of top&#8208;down inputs and controlled contextual cues is reported for the de novo fabrication of patterned dense collagen matrices with spatially varying tailored mesoscale structures. Initially, imposed electrical inputs are used to guide collagen triple helix molecules to partially assemble into a dense metastable molten fibril state that can be induced by permissive contextual cues (especially humidity) to undergo further assembly. Spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs that induce riboflavin&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking can locally&#8208;trap partially assembled states (e.g., molten fibrils). To illustrate the potential of collagen patterning, a functional corneal stromal substitute is specifically fabricated that mimics the microstructures of collagen in cornea&#8208;sclera and demonstrates that it can restore histological structure and function in a corneal defect rabbit model. This generic approach for the de novo fabrication of mesoscale&#8208;structured collagen is envisioned to have broad applications in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled In&#8208;Operando Shape Reconfiguration, Fixation, and Recovery of Magnetically Actuated Microtextured Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds (DS&#8208;CAN) can rearrange its molecular topology through heating or UV irradiation. When combined with ferromagnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature enables contactless, spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic bond exchanges during magnetomechanical actuation. This approach enables 3D microfabrication with selective, chemical&#8208;free, reversible shape reconfiguration and fixation in dry conditions without physical contact.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide&#8208;bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV&#8208;assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above Tv. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high&#8208;temperature activation (&gt; Tv = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in&#8208;operando UV&#8208;fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on&#8208;demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder&#8208;free homologous shape&#8208;fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide-bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV-assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high-temperature activation (&amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV- and heat-induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in-operando UV-fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on-demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder-free homologous shape-fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Center Exploration in Atomically Thin MoSxTe2&#8208;x Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering in a closed&#8208;loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoSxTe2&#8208;x alloy catalyst is created through low&#8208;temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 (S&#8208;MoTe2), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Teads&#8208;Mo). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half&#8208;reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S&#8208;MoTe2 alloy compared to its counterparts without Teads&#8208;Mo. This work provides an intelligent approach to facilitate active center exploration in micrographs and achieves a closed&#8208;loop verification for the ML&#8208;assisted defect discovery via theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, displaying how ML and researchers seamlessly cooperate in a scientific workflow for advanced catalyst development.

         <title>Sonodynamic and Bioorthogonal Sonocatalytic Thrombotic Therapy Based on AIE Cationic Tetranuclear Ir(III) Complex Nanoplatform Guided by NIR&#8208;Chemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

AIE&#8208;active tetranuclear Ir(III) complex Ir&#8208;4 as a sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst is formulated into a nanoplatform with an H2S donor. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs achieves combined endogenous NIR chemiluminescence imaging, sonodynamic therapy and release of H2S in situ by a bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction in vivo, achieving safe thrombolysis and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive thrombolytic strategies include photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of PTT and PDT is impeded by the limited tissue penetration depth of the light source. SDT is a promising method due to the deeper tissue penetration and site&#8208;specific features of ultrasound; however, the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers has constrained its clinical use. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;triggered nanoparticles (NPs), named Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs, achieve a sonodynamic thrombolytic, bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction, with chemiluminescence (CL) imaging in the thrombus. An Ir(III) complex, named Ir&#8208;4, which has aggregation induced emission (AIE), combined with a hydrogen sulfide donor, named H2S&#8208;N3, provide the nanoplatform which is modified with the peptide c(RGDfC) to target the thrombus. This supramolecular assembly successfully integrates: i) thrombosis detection based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging, ii) sonodynamic thrombus therapy and iii) release of hydrogen sulfide for anti&#8208;inflammatory action. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs emit long&#8208;lasting NIR CL triggered by endogenous ONOO&#8722; and achieve 12&#160;mm deep tissue penetration. Blood clots are effectively removed and blood flow is almost fully restored in mouse carotid thrombus and rat femoral vein models. The work demonstrates a new integrated strategy for diagnosing and treating life&#8208;threatening diseases caused by thrombusotic disorders.

         <title>Granular Hydrogels as Brittle Yield Stress Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers yield stress fluid model can describe granular hydrogel deformation. The model robustly captures transient rheology and self&#8208;healing behavior for granular gels of varying composition using only six parameters. This framework provides new insight regarding the effect of material parameters on granular yielding and informs advanced applications such as extrusion&#8208;based granular (hydrogel) printing and material ageing/remodeling.








Abstract
While granular hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedical applications, methods to capture their rheological behavior generally consider shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing properties or produce ensemble metrics (e.g., dynamic moduli) while neglecting transient yielding and unyielding processes. Combining oscillatory shear testing with Brittility (Bt) via the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers (KDR) model, this work shows that granular hydrogels behave as brittle yield stress fluids. This work quantifies steady and transient rheology as a function of microgel properties and granular composition for polyethylene glycol and gelatin microgels. The KDR model with Bt captures granular hydrogel behavior for a wide range of design parameters, reducing the complex rheology to a determination of model parameters. In granular mixtures, this work observes monotonic dependencies of the elastic modulus, structural viscosity, and brittility upon granular composition, while the yield stress is lower for mixtures. Microgel size distribution and polymer fraction are the most influential parameters in monolithic granular hydrogels, while microgel size and packing density are less impactful. The model robustly captures self&#8208;healing behavior and reveals that granular hydrogel relaxation accelerates with an increased small&#8208;amplitude strain rate. This quantitative framework is an important step toward rational design of granular hydrogels for applications ranging from injection and in situ stabilization to 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Activatable Enzymatic Nanoplatform Incorporated into Microneedle Patch for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia Augmented Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Activatable enzymatic nanoplatform incorporated into microneedle patch is developed for relieving tumor hypoxia augmented photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
The clinical advancement of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces entrenched impediments, particularly the suboptimal solubility of hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) and tumor&#8208;associated hypoxia. Herein, a universally applicable, carrier&#8208;free nanotherapeutic platform is devised in which catalase (CAT) functions dually as a biocatalytic oxygenator and a biocompatible scaffold for PSs encapsulation. Through self&#8208;assembly with diverse hydrophobic PSs&#8212;including 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hexyloxyethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;divinyl&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (HPPH), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and zinc (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8212;CAT forms uniform and stable PS@CAT nanoparticles (NPs), obviating the necessity for supplementary nanocarriers. These nanostructures are embedded within microneedle (MN) patches, facilitating minimally invasive, spatially targeted transdermal administration. The PSs bind to the hydrophobic pocket of CAT within NPs, temporarily suppressing its bioactivity, which is restored upon NPs disassembly in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). This pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; mechanism orchestrates the synchronized release of PSs and reactivation of CAT, which catalyzes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) to generate oxygen (O2), alleviating hypoxia and augmenting O2 availability for PDT. In vivo validation in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model corroborated this approach's therapeutic superiority and biocompatibility. Collectively, the findings delineate a minimalist, multifunctional strategy to simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of PSs and overcome hypoxia in PDT for more efficacious oncologic therapy.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Size&#8208;Change Nanovaccine for Enhancing Lymph Node Deep Penetration and Eliciting Robust Antitumor Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic size&#8208;change nanovaccines (DashVax) overcome the lymphatic delivery paradox through programmed size transition. Constructed from dynamic covalent bonds, these 102 nm assemblies time&#8208;dependently disassemble into 5 nm subunits within LNs, leveraging large&#8208;particle drainage efficiency while enabling small&#8208;particle penetration through anatomical barriers. This dynamic size&#8208;change strategy achieves 7.3&#215; enhanced paracortical delivery, potentiating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppressing tumor growth in B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models.








Abstract
Breakthrough advances in nanotechnology have substantially enhanced lymph node (LN) targeting efficiency and immune cell uptake of nanovaccines, establishing novel avenues for tumor immunotherapy. Nevertheless, current nanovaccines predominantly accumulate in subcapsular sinuses (SCS) or superficial cortical regions post&#8208;lymphatic transport, failing to traverse anatomical barriers to reach the T cell&#8208;enriched paracortex&#8212;a critical delivery bottleneck that severely limits full activation of cellular immunity. Furthermore, the absence of tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli in LN microenvironments invalidates conventional environment&#8208;responsive delivery strategies. Herein, &#8220;dynamically size&#8208;change nanovaccine&#8221; (DashVax), a time&#8208;controlled self&#8208;disassembling nanovaccine is presented that achieves dynamic size transition from 102 to 5 nm via physiologically regulated imine bond hydrolysis. This design capitalizes on the lymphatic drainage superiority of large particles and tissue&#8208;penetrating capacity of small units, achieving a breakthrough 7.3&#8208;fold enhancement in paracortical antigen delivery compared to non&#8208;size&#8208;change nanovaccines (NoncVax). DashVax demonstrates&#160;robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and tumor growth suppression in both B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models. This exogenous stimulus&#8208;free temporal delivery strategy not only redefines nanovaccine design principles but also elucidates fundamental correlations between intranodal delivery kinetics and immune activation efficacy.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Mode Photothermal, Phase&#8208;Change, and Radiative&#8208;Cooling Film for All&#8208;Day Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Ti2O3/TiO2 composite shells are designed for LSPR modulation. MPCMs have full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional tri&#8208;mode photothermal, phase&#8208;change, and radiative&#8208;cooling film is developed for efficient solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric (STE) energy conversion. The MPCMs and composite films provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced STE conversion applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric conversion shows great promise, especially in off&#8208;grid aerospace and navigation. However, low output density and intermittency of solar energy limit its application. Herein, a microencapsulated phase change material (MPCMs) is designed with a n&#8208;Tetracosane core and TiO2/Ti2O3 composite shell to address the above issue. The MPCM exhibits a latent heat of 144.5 J&#160;g&#8722;1, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.7% and 100% energy storage capacity. The thermoelectric system resulting from coupling the multifunctional film composed of polydimethylsiloxane and MPCMs with the thermoelectric module is capable of successfully achieving adaptive 24&#160;h uninterrupted power generation on account of its functions of photothermal conversion, energy storage, and radiative cooling. The output power density of the TES ranged from 6.1 to 21.1&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 at light intensities of 1000&#8211;5000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. The material design innovatively endows a single material with the functions of photothermal conversion, phase change energy storage, and radiative cooling, making it can adaptively harvest energy from both the sun and cold space. This multifunctional material offers new insights into the repeatable storage and high&#8208;quality utilization of solar energy, holding significant scientific implications for the development of all&#8208;day solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric power generation technology.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Elastomer with High Luminescent and Mechanical Performances Enabled by Multiple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.

         <title>A Gas Nanobomb to Promote Drug Penetration and Amplify TACE Therapy for Orthotopic Liver Tumor</title>

Multifunctional embolic agent is successfully synthesized with the introduction of magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanoparticles into lipiodol (Lip) &amp;tirapazamine (TPZ) dispersion for efficient supply H2, OH&#8722;, and Mg2+. The L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension demonstrates effective elimination of primary tumors, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and recurrence when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transarterial embolization by L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.








Abstract
The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH2) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co&#8208;dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH2 nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH2 nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&#8722; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H2) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen&#8208;based chemotherapy; and Mg2+ synergistically regulates T&#8208;cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H2 and Mg2+&#8208;induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH2 nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Recycling Ruthenium Incorporated CuFe2O4 Electrocatalyst for Efficient Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electrogenerated adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) species effectively capture OH&#8722; ions, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface. This promotes a self&#8208;sustaining cycle between Fe2+ad release and &#945;&#8208;FeOOH reconstruction, endowing the electrocatalyst with both high NH3 selectivity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The high performance of Fe&#8208;based electrocatalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction to ammonia (eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) is currently constrained by low NH3 selectivity and insufficient stability under high current density. Hence, the incorporation of ruthenium single&#8208;atom into the CuFe2O4 (RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4) with self&#8208;recycling property is developed. The Cu and Ru sites synergistically promote the water dissociation and facilitate the redeposition of in situ adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) as &#945;&#8208;FeOOH by self&#8208;reinforcing local alkalinity at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface, thereby achieving high activity and robust stability for eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. The optimized RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 delivers excellent performance with a 97.9% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and 99.8% NH3 selectivity at &#8722;0.59&#160;V versus RHE in neutral electrolyte. Remarkably, in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system, it achieves a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.5&#160;V with robust stability, accompanied by &gt;95% NH3 selectivity, a nitrate removal rate of 4.17&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an NH3 production rate of 3.97&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Ru site in the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 significantly enhances NO3&#8722; adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for the potential determining step (*HNO2 &#8594; *NO). This work offers valuable insights into designing autonomous local alkalinity microenvironments with self&#8208;recycling properties on cost&#8208;effective Cu/Fe oxides.

         <title>Resonator&#8208;Free Metamaterials Based on Ferromagnetic Dielectrics for Mandatory Microwave Loss and Compact Stealth Cloaks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic dielectric metamaterials are constructed by arranging ferromagnetic dielectric units composed of CIPs and PU. The incident wave is transformed into a surface wave crawling along the metamaterial by adjusting the phase gradient and unit size. In addition, due to the microwave attenuation effect of the ferromagnetic dielectric, the surface wave is lost secondarily.








Abstract
The utilization of resonant&#8208;unit&#8208;based metamaterials in beam control and compact stealth applications is inherently limited by the strong correlation between unit in&#8208;plane dimensions and reflection characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes a resonator&#8208;free metamaterial based on ferromagnetic dielectric that decouples the amplitude and phase by regulating interface interference, thereby achieving phase modulation independent of the in&#8208;plane dimensions of the FD units. With the introduction of a constant phase gradient and tuning of unit dimensions, reflected waves can be deflected or even converted into surface waves that propagate along the metamaterial interface. This enables a novel electromagnetic loss mechanism wherein the reflected energy undergoes mandatory attenuation by horizontally propagating within the lossy ferromagnetic dielectric. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove this phenomenon, yielding an improvement of 36.64% in the average power loss density, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;52&#160;dB. Further, the efficacy of ferromagnetic dielectric units is validated for compact stealth cloaks, and a conformal curved stealth strategy that requires only unit dimension tuning to achieve scattering&#8208;field camouflage for arbitrarily shaped targets is proposed. Given its resonator&#8208;independent operation, the proposed metamaterial exhibits miniaturization advantages of cross&#8208;scale downsizing (in&#8208;plane dimension &lt; &#955;/12)&#8212;a critical advancement for compact electromagnetic defense systems.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Chelating and ROS&#8208;Scavenging Polymers with Thioketal and Thioether Bonds Delivering Ferroptosis Inhibitor Lip&#8208;1 Provide a Triple Therapeutic Strategy for Retina Ganglion Cells in Acute Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip&#8208;1 into NPsLip&#8208;1. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip&#8208;1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.








Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron&#8208;chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip&#8208;1 are designed and self&#8208;assembled into NPsLip&#8208;1, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPsLip1 by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip&#8208;1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip&#8208;1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPsLip&#8208;1 with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPsLip&#8208;1 effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPsLip&#8208;1 provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.

&lt;p&gt;This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip-1 into NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip-1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron-chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip-1 are designed and self-assembled into NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip1&lt;/sup&gt; by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip-1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip-1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A GaN Schottky Barrier Diode&#8208;Based Terahertz Metasurface for High&#8208;Precision Phase Control and High&#8208;Speed Beam Scanning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable terahertz metasurface based on gallium nitride Schottky barrier diodes is demonstrated. By tuning antenna resonance via junction capacitance, the metasurface achieves high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;precision, and fast&#8208;response continuous phase modulation over a wide range. Dual&#8208;mode (analog/digital) operation enables &#177;45&#176; beam scanning with flat gain, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation THz communication and sensing.








Abstract
Effective wavefront control in the terahertz (THz) regime is essential for achieving high&#8208;directionality beamforming, spatial multiplexing, and real&#8208;time wireless communication. However, low&#8208;loss, precise, and rapid THz phase modulation remains fundamentally constrained by material limitations and inherent device&#8208;level trade&#8208;offs. A programmable THz metasurface (GaNMS) is presented, employing a gallium nitride Schottky barrier diode with a high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas, specifically designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging its low insertion loss, fast response, and continuously tunable junction capacitance. A 32 &#215; 25&#8208;element array is designed and fabricated. Each unit cell functions as a direct THz phase shifter, dynamically tuning the junction capacitance to enable continuous phase modulation from 0&#176; to 210&#176; at 0.32 THz, with a 1.8&#176; average phase error, modulation speed exceeding 200&#160;MHz, and &#8776;5&#160;dB average insertion loss. To mitigate array&#8208;level nonuniformities, a differential evolution&#8208;based optimization algorithm is introduced, enabling robust &#177;45&#176; beam scanning in both analog and digital modes, with main lobe gains of 18.5 and 16 dBi, respectively. An integrated GaNMS&#8208;based sensing and communication system is also demonstrated, validating its potential in next&#8208;generation THz applications. The proposed GaNMS bridges device&#8208;level phase tunability and system&#8208;level functionality, enabling practical THz technologies.

         <title>Scalable Production of 24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow Plastics Through Molecular Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;H&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) plastics are fabricated at a large scale through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials can be activated by natural sunlight, highlighting their practical utility for engineering applications.








Abstract
The development of polymeric afterglow materials has garnered significant interest due to their promising applications in sensing technologies, smart devices, and optoelectronic systems. However, conventional engineering plastics typically exhibit limited afterglow properties owing to rapid nonradiative decay processes under ambient conditions. This study presents a breakthrough in the fabrication of plastics with 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) properties through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. By utilizing aromatic plastics as electron acceptor and the matrix, spirofluorene derivatives are incorporated as electron donors and chromophore dopants via a melt blending technique, a widely established method in polymer manufacturing. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions. At 4&#160;&#176;C, the HLA lasted for up to 100 h after ceasing photoexcitation, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials could be activated by natural sunlight and maintain a visible green afterglow for 5 h in ambient air. Mechanism studies revealed that the HLA phenomenon is associated with the formation of donor/acceptor exciplexes upon photoexcitation. Additionally, the HLA plastics exhibited exceptional mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, making them highly suitable for advanced applications in flexible displays and next&#8208;generation wearable technologies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;polarized Acidic Water Electrolysis with Antenna&#8208;Reactor Plasmonic Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral plasmonic antenna&#8211;reactor electrocatalyst, integrating Au nanoflowers as the antenna and iridium single atoms as the reactor, achieves spin&#8208;polarized and light&#8208;driven water electrolysis in acidic media. The catalyst exhibits high activity and durability, enabled by hot&#8208;carrier transfer and the CISS effect, as supported by operando spectroscopy and DFT simulations.









Abstract

Water electrolysis, driven by renewable electricity, offers a sustainable path for hydrogen production. However, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotentials of both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. To address this, a novel catalyst system is developed integrating plasmonic nanoreactors with chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. In this system, chiral Au nanoparticles act as antennae, while single&#8208;atom iridium serves as the catalytic reactor, achieving a 3.5 fold increase in reaction kinetics (at 1.57&#160;V vs RHE) compared to commercial IrO2 catalysts and enhancing durability by over 4.8 times relative to conventional Pt/C || IrO2 systems. Density functional theory and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that plasmon&#8208;driven spin alignment polarizes the Ir atom, significantly enhancing stability (&gt;480 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) under acidic conditions. This work represents a major advance in spin polarization for plasmonic electrocatalysis, offering a new route to sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Highly Responsive Self&#8208;Healing and Degradable Piezoelectric Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a self&#8208;healing and stretchable material is used to develop a damage resistant energy harvester capable of powering electric bulbs, and a sensing system to intelligently classify biomechanical activities is represented.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials that are simultaneously healable, stretchable, and degradable have remained an unmet challenge, limiting advancements in wearable and implantable electronics, where devices face multidimensional mechanical deformation, causing a risk of damage. To address this critical gap, a biocompatible piezoelectric material is developed for ultrahigh piezoelectric effects with DL&#8208;alanine amino acid crystals, which is stretchable, healable, and degradable. The in situ grown DL&#8208;alanine piezoelectric crystals within an ionically cross&#8208;linked gelatin hydrogel matrix strengthen the piezoelectric properties with an ultrahigh voltage coefficient of 1.6 Vm&#160;N&#8722;1. The combination of the piezo&#8208;ionic property and crystal alignment results in a record&#8208;breaking energy harvesting figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value at 57.6 pm2&#160;N&#8722;1 to deliver outstanding mili&#8208;watt level power outputs in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices which can power up even several electric light bulbs. An elastically stretchable, damage resistant strain sensor is further optimized for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring and biomechanical motion tracking. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the sensing system intelligently classifies biomechanical activities with high accuracy, enabling advanced applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports monitoring.

         <title>Immobilizing Lead and Healing Surface Defects via Perfluorinated Tertiary Amine Molecules Enables High&#8208;Performance Sustainable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorination strategy using perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) enables simultaneous surface defect passivation and lead immobilization in inverted perovskite solar cells. This approach yields a certified efficiency of 26.65% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability, offering a promising route toward high&#8208;performance and environmentally sustainable perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
The intrinsic instability and nonradiative recombination induced by surface defects hinder the further development of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Simultaneously, the commercial application of inverted PSCs is limited by environmental unfriendliness resulting from lead leakage. Herein, a universal perfluorination strategy is reported to immobilize lead and passivate surface defects of perovskite films in inverted PSCs. It is demonstrated that perfluorinated perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) can form PFTEA&#183;PbI2 complex with PbI2 via a strong coordination bond, which is favorable for suppressing lead leakage and promoting defect passivation. Due to much reduced surface nonradiative recombination, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated inverted PSCs deliver a fascinating certified stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, a record efficiency value reported for PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation technique. Moreover, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated devices maintain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work provides a simple and effective avenue to advance the sustainable development of inverted photovoltaic technology through a perfluorination strategy.

         <title>Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment strategy of spin&#8208;coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI2 as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post&#8208;treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI2 on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI2) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI2 that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long&#8208;term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs3ErCl6 quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post&#8208;treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI2 can react with Cs3ErCl6 QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI2. The pretreated perovskite layer has a better&#160;fit grain, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability of the device. The (FAPbI3) 0.95(MAPbBr3) 0.05 perovskite solar cell treated using the pretreatment method demonstrates a champion PCE of 26.01%. This work offers new perspectives for inhibiting excessive PbI2 growth and thus holds great promise for advancing the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells and contributing to the future landscape of renewable energy.

         <title>Nanoporous Hydrogels with Tunable Pore Size for Efficient Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous hydrogels with tunable pore sizes ranging from 78 to 161&#160;nm are developed using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy. The structural integrity of the hydrogel nanochannels under hydrated conditions is confirmed via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. This work establishes a direct correlation between reduced pore size and enhanced streaming potential, providing new insights into the design of efficient hydrovoltaic materials.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators represent an emerging technology for converting low&#8208;grade water&#8208;based energy into electricity, and hydrogels are favored for their water absorption and ion&#8208;responsive properties. However, the controllable fabrication and precise micromorphological characterization of nanoporous hydrogels remain challenging, hindering the understanding of ion transport within confined water channels. In this work, a nanoporous hydrogel with tunable pore sizes is presented, developed through a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy using &#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes. The pore size can be systematically tuned from 78 to 161&#160;nm, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy confirms the presence of hydrated nanochannels. The results highlight the critical role of streaming potential in electricity generation, with the device achieving a threefold increase in voltage by reducing the pore size. The optimized device delivers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.05&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 100&#160;&#181;A with a 0.1&#160;m NaCl droplet. Moreover,a practical application is demonstrated through a sweat&#8208;monitoring patch that visually responds to ion concentration changes. This work advances the design of high&#8208;efficiency hydrovoltaic systems by establishing a clear link between tunable nanoscale architecture and device performance, paving the way for scalable energy harvesting and sensing technologies.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Matched Iridium on Vanadium Nitride as Efficient Hydrogen Electrocatalyst</title>

A lattice&#8208;matched molten co&#8208;growth strategy for constructing a controllable Ir structure with preferential active facet exposure on VN support, realizing highly efficient HOR/HER catalysis.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir), with optimal hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl bonding energy (OHBE), is considered a promising platform for achieving bi&#8208;directional hydrogen catalysis. However, traditional Ir&#8208;based catalysts with multiple crystalline facets exhibit a gap between the apparent activity and theoretical value, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, a molten co&#8208;growth process of Ir and vanadium nitride (Ir&#8208;VN) is reported, realizing precise exposure of lattice&#8208;matched Ir (111) on VN with optimal HBE and OHBE, for highly active hydrogen catalysis. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst demonstrates exceptional HOR activity with exchange currents 1.8&#8211;4.8 times higher than those of noble metal benchmark catalysts, as well as improved durability and CO tolerance. The unique lattice&#8208;matching effect promotes the directional electron transfer and induces shortened Ir&#9472;Ir bonds via the strongly coupled interface, therefore resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;CO capability. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst also demonstrates great HER activity and operational durability in a wide pH range, requiring only 21, 12, and 82&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, respectively. This work not only deepens the understanding of hydrogen electrocatalysis mechanisms but also inspires the rational design and controllable synthesis of catalysts with active crystal facets for various applications.

Ultra&#8208;tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra&#8208;tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low&#8208;temperature impact resistance.








Abstract
Traditional impact&#8208;resistant plastics become brittle at low temperatures due to restricted polymer chain mobility, rendering them unsuitable for cryogenic applications. Developing ultra&#8208;tough plastics with superior impact resistance under extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, this study reports the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) plastics by cross&#8208;linking soft poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG) chains through multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with varying binding energies. The PUU plastic features a bicontinuous phase&#8208;separated nanostructure, where hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked, rigid yet deformable domains are interpenetrated with soft PTMEG chains. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical properties comparable to those of ultra&#8208;tough, high&#8208;strength plastics at ambient temperature, with yield strength of 81.1&#160;MPa, breaking strength of 133.0&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of 1.5&#160;GPa, and breaking strain of 220.9%. A 0.3&#8208;mm&#8208;thick sample achieves a maximum impact force of 667.8 N and an impact energy of 3.8 J at &#8722;50 &#176;C, while maintaining exceptional mechanical robustness and flexibility even at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The low&#8208;temperature toughness and impact resistance of the PUU plastics surpass those of existing impact&#8208;resistant plastics. This study demonstrates that hydrogen bonds with a broad spectrum of binding energies serve as ideal cross&#8208;links for fabricating ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant plastics suitable for cryogenic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-tough and impact-resistant poly(urea-urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross-linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen-bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra-tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low-temperature impact resistance.
